"The Conservative Party would reduce the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) from 650 to 500 if they were elected. 

Michael Howard, the party's leader, announced this policy as part of their larger ""smaller government"" initiative, which is expected to be released shortly. Other changes proposed in the manifesto include reducing the amount of time for MPs to speak and introducing an electoral system that favours greater representation of rural areas.

Howard further suggested that there should be fewer government officials, such as special advisors, in order to save money and limit political influence. He argued this will lead to more transparency and accountability to the public.

"The United Kingdom is set to take a stand against the use of controversial tactics by US casinos, which have long employed various techniques to entice gamblers. According to reports, culture secretary Tessa Jowell intends for any super-casinos that may be built in the country to operate differently than those found in the States. The decision comes as part of an effort to promote social responsibility within the industry and protect vulnerable individuals who might otherwise fall prey to addictive behaviors associated with excessive gambling. 
Tessa Jowell explained that one significant difference between British and US casinos would be the absence of pheromone releases used to stimulate aggression among players. By omitting this tactic, authorities hope to create a more level playing field where personal integrity and self-control prevail over manipulative psychological strategies. Furthermore, Jowell emphasized the need to maintain traditional clock aesthetics, arguing that removing them could disrupt players' perception of time and lead to potentially reckless behavior on slot machines or poker tables. These changes are being implemented to prevent potential issues related to compulsive gambling addiction and to preserve the overall well-being of the population. It is crucial not only to address concerns surrounding problem gambling but also to foster an environment that respects ethical practices within the industry. By doing so, the government aims to build confidence in British casinos and attract visitors while promoting fairness and ensuring responsible gaming experiences. Ultimately, the move signifies a proactive approach towards safeguarding public welfare and protecting individuals from exploitative practices commonly seen in many establishments across North America. As Britain prepares to welcome its first high-stakes venues under strict regulations, other nations can learn valuable lessons about balancing profit and morality, ultimately contributing to creating safer gambling environments globally.

"Jack Straw, former Leader of the House of Commons and Conservative MP for North East Hertfordshire (1992-2001), today announced his opposition to the decision made by Britain's highest Court regarding detainee releases. 

Straw argued that the Supreme Court's ruling, which stated that detention without trial could be deemed a violation of human rights law, went against British values and principles. “The right to life is surely the most important liberty we have as citizens”, he said during a press conference in Westminster. “This government takes its responsibility to safeguard those liberties very seriously and will always take appropriate action when it feels they are threatened"". 

He continued to say that the government was not responsible for the decisions of the courts and that the judiciary should stay within their legal obligations. “These rulings should not be seen as an affront to the rule of law”, Straw insisted. “On the contrary, I believe this is an opportunity for us to reflect upon our policies and procedures surrounding counterterrorism measures.”

Straw also addressed the concerns raised by critics over the potential abuse of power under the new policy. He pointed out that all relevant checks had been conducted before any detainee was released, and that due process had been followed throughout. “We want to ensure that everyone remains safe and secure, but at the same time we must never forget our core principles of justice and fairness"", he added. 

Straw concluded by saying that he respected the opinion of the High Courts and would carefully consider all aspects of the case. He hoped that the government's position would ultimately be accepted by both sides so that progress could continue towards ensuring public safety and upholding fundamental rights.

The UK's political parties are facing scrutiny over their upcoming election campaigns after it was revealed that they could be using illegal phone-call tactics.

Both the Conservative Party and Labour have come under fire from privacy advocates and anti-telemarketing groups, since they have yet to release details on their plans for avoiding unwanted callers. 

According to reports, both parties are considering utilizing predictive dialers – software which will automatically take telephone numbers without consent and then call them multiple times. This method would allow parties to save time and money on campaign calling costs. 

However, this has raised concerns among politicians and citizens alike, as it could easily become a form of exploitation. In addition, adding insult to injury, the parties may also be violating existing laws related to data protection and privacy.

The Liberal Democrats have taken a stronger stance against the use of such techniques, calling for an immediate halt to all forms of unsolicited campaigning. They have urged the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to investigate further into whether or not the current regulations should be updated in order to prevent any potential abuse.

It is clear that British voters need clarity on how their personal information is being used during the upcoming elections. With so much at stake, it is vital that political candidates adhere to the law and respect the rights of those registering to vote. Otherwise, the entire democratic process could be called into question.

"In recent years, political corruption and fraud have become increasingly prevalent issues in many countries around the world. This is particularly true when it comes to election processes, where politicians are often accused of using illegal methods such as ballot stuffing or tampering in order to secure their victory. Such fraudulent activities undermine public trust and confidence in the electoral system, which can ultimately lead to serious social and economic consequences for citizens. 

    The case of three Labour councillors from Birmingham who operated a vote rigging ‘factory’ is just one example of how this kind of misconduct can occur on a small scale. During a late-night police raid on a derelict property near to Aston Ward in June 2004, officers discovered that the three had been illegally collecting sealed ballots from mailboxes outside homes. When questioned by officials afterwards, they admitted to having carried out similar operations in previous months leading up to the English local elections earlier that year. 

This type of behaviour is not only unethical but also illegal under current UK law - yet despite this evidence of criminal activity, no prosecution ever followed due to lack of sufficient proof beyond reasonable doubt. It's clear something needs to be done if we want to ensure our democracy remains free and fair for all.",phi2,1
"News Article Title: British Prisoners Freed From Guantánamo Bay Return Home to Uphill Battle Against Reintegration

    The release of four British citizens who have spent nearly five years in detention at Guantanamo Bay has marked a significant milestone, but their journey home is just beginning. Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi, and Richard Belmar will face numerous obstacles as they attempt to reenter society after being labeled terrorists. 

    Begg's return was met with excitement when it was announced that he may finally see his family again following his three-year ordeal in captivity. However, the reality of what awaits him upon arrival on UK soil is daunting - unemployment, social isolation, and stigma. Despite the fact that all four men have renounced terrorism and pose no threat to national security, many fear that public opinion remains largely hostile towards them.

    Former detainee, Azmat Begg, spoke candidly regarding his concerns over the potential backlash his son might experience upon returning home. “I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it can be for former detainees trying to rebuild their lives,"" he stated. ""There's still this pervasive attitude amongst some people that anyone from Afghanistan or Pakistan must therefore be involved in terrorist activity.""

    While the government maintains that its decision not to extend immigration restrictions to ex-detainees was made based solely on legal considerations, others argue that there is more going on behind closed doors. Critics claim that political pressures played a role in keeping tabs on these individuals, despite assurances that they posed no immediate danger.

    Regardless of the reasons behind the decision, the impact on the families of those released cannot be ignored. For many like Begg's sister, Farida, the relief of seeing her brother free after such an extended period of time was mixed with anxiety about his future. ""It feels amazing, but I worry about my brother struggling to fit back into society,"" she remarked.

    As the world waits to learn more about the challenges faced by those returned to civilian life after prolonged periods of incarceration, questions remain surrounding how best to support these formerly detained prisoners. It is clear that simply providing freedom without accompanying resources does little justice to their cause, yet finding ways to address issues related to employment, housing, and mental health presents a complex challenge.

    In response to growing awareness of the difficulties facing ex-detainees upon their release, governments worldwide are now taking steps to improve post-release services. Programs designed specifically for these populations aim to provide job training, education opportunities, counseling and other forms of assistance necessary to facilitate successful integration. While progress is certainly slow, advocates believe that efforts like these offer hope that even former captives caught up in the criminalization of Islamism will eventually find peace within their communities once again.",phi2,1
"The UK's Supreme Court Judge, Lord Woolf, has expressed frustration at Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other Ministers over their insistence that they have the power to appoint the head of public inquiries. This week, Lord Woolf took to his posts in the House of Lords to explain his position — he stated that he was committed to preserving the independent judiciary, but that it should not be denied by ministerial interference. This decision has caused tension between the Government and the Judiciary, with many arguing that the Lord Chief Justice should have more autonomy when it comes to choosing inquiry leaders. 

Lord Woolf made it clear to the Parliament that he is not willing to yield to the demands of the Government, especially when it comes to matters of great importance to the independent judiciary. He argued that the current system works well, as it allows judges to choose who will lead investigations into serious criminal offences without political influence or pressure. He further added that any change would only serve to undermine the principles of justice and fairness which form the bedrock of British legal practice. 

Meanwhile, the Labour Party has voiced its support for Lord Woolf's stance. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper praised him for standing up to the Government and protecting the integrity of the courts. She suggested that if the Government were so confident in their ability to choose investigators then why do they need to consult with the Lord Chief Justice? Moreover, she argued that this move could set a dangerous precedent where politicians can use the law to advance their own interests rather than upholding justice. 

Despite the criticism from the Opposition, there is no sign that the issue will be resolved soon. Both sides appear to be firmly entrenched in their positions, with little hope of finding common ground. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Britain's judicial landscape, with the potential for major changes to the way in which public inquiries are conducted.

    Ex-Downing St. Media Chief Backed by All Sides as Labour Gears up for General Election,

The Labour Party is gearing up ahead of the upcoming general elections after former Downing Street Director of Communications and PR Alastair Campbell announced he would be returning to the fold to help bolster its efforts.

Alastair Campbell had previously left his position at Downing Street when Tony Blair stepped down as leader of the ruling Conservative Party in 2004 but it looks like he may once again find himself back among ranks of politicians this time around, working hard to ensure that the Labor Party can make an impact on the political landscape.

His re-emergence into politics was met with both excitement and scepticism from many corners; some thought he could bring much needed experience and expertise to bear while others questioned whether his departure last time was motivated more out of spite than anything else.

Nevertheless, all sides seem to welcome him back with open arms now, seeing him as somebody who truly cares deeply for Labour’s chances in the next general election which are due to take place later this year.

Tessa Jowell, the then Culture secretary said “He brings a wealth of knowledge gained during his time at Number 10 and I am sure he will continue to work tirelessly in helping secure success for our country.”

Similarly, deputy prime minister John Prescott added that he felt confident “he will provide great leadership within the Labour Party going forward.""

    The final days for hunters to take part in traditional foxhunting activities have arrived, marking an end to decades-old practices. These hunts will commence in both English and Welsh regions before moving to other parts of the country over the coming weeks. As the hunt approaches its conclusion, it's evident that thousands of people are eagerly anticipating this eventful weekend. In addition, some meetings have even adjusted their regular agendas by scheduling themselves exclusively during this time frame. 

Hunts in England and Wales have been permitted until now because they're not considered sports but rather viewed as important cultural traditions within rural communities. However, following years of growing public opposition to such practices, legislation has recently been passed prohibiting the use of animals for recreational purposes. This new law officially takes force from next Wednesday at 12 midnight (0500 GMT) onwards when all licensed hunters must cease pursuing game using dogs. Nonetheless, there remain exemptions allowing those who participate professionally or possess special permits. Additionally, members of certain religious faiths may still engage in these activities without facing penalties.

"The Liberal Democrats are making headlines once again as they announce that they have chosen a new face to lead their communication efforts during the upcoming 2019 General Election. The Lib Dems have selected veteran politician, and former Prime Minister's Chief Advisor, John Smith, to serve as the head of their public relations team. This comes after months of speculation surrounding who would take over this important role within the party.

John Smith is no stranger to political life; before entering government service he served in various ministerial positions including Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. He has also spent many years working at various think tanks and campaign organisations. His experience makes him an ideal choice for the job, it is believed that his vast knowledge of policymaking and campaigning tactics should prove invaluable to the Lib Dem's electoral success in 2019. 

This move by the Lib Dems comes amid growing tensions inside the party between those advocating for a more progressive agenda and those wishing to maintain the status quo. It remains to be seen whether John Smith can successfully navigate these divisions and bring the party together behind a single vision. 

The Liberal Democrats' decision to appoint John Smith as their new communication director is undoubtedly a strategic one. With elections looming large and the party desperately trying to make up ground on its competitors, having someone with both political acumen and communication skills at the helm could well give them the edge they need. It will be interesting to see how Smith leads the party into the future, and if he can help them achieve the results they seek.

"The Standard Investigation Committee (SIC) has confirmed that an investigation is currently underway in relation to former British politician, Kenneth ‘Ken’ Livingstone. Following accusations from a member of the media, The Guardian, that Mayor Livingstone had brought his office into disrepute through personal remarks made during a recent political rally, the SIC have decided to launch a thorough and impartial inquiry. 

    According to sources close to the situation, the chief investigator for the SIC has stated that when compared to other politicians in the region, Mr Livingstone's comments were particularly egregious due to their nature and depth. In addition to the ethical issues posed by his remarks, it was noted that he seemed to be unaware of or unconcerned by the consequences of his statements, further fuelling public concern. 

The investigation will look at whether or not there are grounds for believing that Mr Livingstone breached any standards expected of elected officials in terms of professionalism and integrity. It may also examine his general conduct since entering office as well as any previous cases involving similar offences. Furthermore, the SIC plans to investigate if any official action should be taken against the mayor given the circumstances surrounding the incident. 

The decision to launch this formal investigation comes after multiple reports of inappropriate behaviour from constituents and members of the press. These include various accounts of offensive language being used towards individuals of different backgrounds; derogatory references to particular ethnic groups; and insults aimed at people based on their gender identity. The SIC hopes its work can provide clarity on what constitutes proper conduct among politicians, thereby setting an example for future generations.

"The Conservative Party has announced its intentions to eliminate 164 quangots in an effort to reduce waste, bureaucracy, and over-regulation. This move comes as part of Prime Minister David Cameron’s initiative to make sure that British taxpayers’ money is spent efficiently. 

The quangoes, many of which were established during the Labour Government, serve no practical purpose and add nothing to society. In fact, they often create unnecessary complications in regulation and governance. For example, the Fair Access Regulator for Universities, created by the Liberal Democrats, was found to be ineffective at ensuring fairness in student admissions. 

Similarly, the Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) were formed to ensure co-ordination between NHS providers, but they suffered from bureaucratic layers that caused delays and extra costs. Similarly, the Education Reform Act 2008 established the Teaching Agency to improve teacher quality, but it failed to deliver on its promises. 

The Conservatives argue that the removal of these unneeded bodies will save millions of pounds in wasted public funds. To make this possible, the party proposes replacing them with streamlined organizations focused on specific tasks, such as drug safety evaluation. 

In addition, the party says that the government needs to simplify the regulations governing businesses, particularly small enterprises, so that they can compete on a level playing field. This will help encourage innovation and growth and lead to increased economic productivity. 

These reforms come despite some criticism from within the Conservative Party itself. Some conservatives worry that eliminating certain quangos could hurt important policies, such as data protection or environmental protections. However, the party argues that those policies can still exist without redundant quangos. 

Overall, the Conservatives’ plan to eliminate quangos demonstrates their commitment to reducing wasteful spending and streamlining the regulatory environment. If successful, these measures will make life easier for both citizens and businesses.

According to leaked documents, PS and CD have been involved in several illegal transactions over the past year, including bribing officials, embezzling funds, and laundering money for foreign interests. The revelations came as part of an investigation into PS's alleged involvement in a secret deal with a terrorist group, which allegedly aimed to overthrow the government and install a regime friendly to their agenda. In response to the allegations, PS issued a statement claiming they were baseless and politically motivated, while CD denied any wrongdoing and accused PS of orchestrating them to undermine his leadership. However, not all of PS s supporters agree with him on this matter; some have called for a full-scale inquiry into the allegations and demanded PS resign or face impeachment. Meanwhile, opposition leader Alice Jones (AJ) seized the opportunity to attack PS and CD, accusing them of betraying the public trust and putting national security at risk. She also claimed they had lost the support of many voters who wanted to see a change in direction from the status quo party, which she said was failing to address key issues such as health care, education, and climate change. AJ pledged to lead her own movement of progressive reformers if elected, promising to bring more transparency, accountability, and innovation to the system. Her announcement sparked mixed reactions among the electorate, especially among those who felt disillusioned and disenfranchised by the current parties. Some praised her vision and courage, while others criticized her lack of experience and credibility.

"The UK's political landscape was rocked today by a sweeping announcement that will have major implications for millions of people across all sectors. Prime Minister Johnson announced in his first speech since being elected that the UK Government is planning on introducing a new pensions policy, which will require public sector workers to work longer before they are eligible to receive any benefits. This decision was immediately met with criticism from various trade unions who argued that this would put an undue burden on many elderly citizens, as well as lead to increased costs for the government.

In response to these concerns, the government has yet to make a definitive statement on the matter, but officials have maintained that the decision is necessary in order to reduce the strain on the country's finances. It remains to be seen whether or not the proposed plan will be implemented, however, given the opposition it has already encountered.
A: In addition to the initial uproar caused by Prime Minister Johnson's proposal to increase the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65, the government made two other announcements that have further stoked fears among the public. 
Firstly, the government revealed its intent to scrap the current final-salary pension system, which provides retirees with a guaranteed income based on their years of service. Instead, workers will now need to contribute more money into their individual accounts in order to secure their retirement incomes. This move has been heavily criticised by critics, many of whom argue that it unfairly discriminates against those earning lower wages, while also failing to take account of rising living expenses. 
Moreover, the government hinted at its intention to introduce a controversial 'cap' on lifetime earnings, meaning that individuals will only be able to save up to a certain amount during their working lives. Once again, this measure has drawn considerable attention from the media and labour unions, who say it will disproportionately affect poorer members of society. 
Overall, these latest proposals represent a significant shift towards a culture of insecurity among Britain's workforce, where employees must now worry not only about achieving success in their careers but also saving enough for their retirements. It remains to be seen how these changes will play out in practice, but one thing is clear: the British government's approach to healthcare and pensions is evolving quickly, and many are beginning to wonder what the future holds.

"The government has announced new measures aimed at reducing stress levels for witnesses who give evidence in criminal trials. 

Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, has declared that his policies aim to make criminal justice more accessible and less intimidating for everyone involved in the legal process. As part of his plans, he is aiming to ensure that all crown courts and 90 percent of magistrates' courts have facilities to isolate witnesses from defendants. Furthermore, there will be an increase in the number of video link calls so that witnesses can avoid having to physically attend the courtroom. This should reduce the burden on witnesses, particularly those who are intimidated or anxious about being in the same room as their perpetrators.

The announcement was met with relief among lawyers, campaigners and victims' groups. Chris O'Toole, head of policy at Liberty, said the move could help to reduce psychological trauma caused by having to testify against someone they knew. ""It's a positive step forward and shows that the government is listening to the concerns of the public,"" he commented.

However, some critics argued that the additional measures were not enough, saying that more needs to be done to protect witnesses from intimidation and pressure. Paul Brookes, director of public affairs at the Law Society, said that while it was encouraging to see the government taking steps towards protecting witnesses, more needed to be done. He called for increased funding for legal aid, greater support for vulnerable witnesses, and improved training for judges and prosecutors. 

Despite these criticisms, the government has remained optimistic about the potential impact of its reforms.

"Pakistan's new Prime Minister, Imran Khan, announced yesterday that he had chosen his cabinet ministers. The decision was made after months of negotiations and discussions within the ruling party. Among those selected as part of the cabinet are former military leaders who have held high-ranking positions under previous administrations. These individuals were seen as trusted allies by PM Khan and were believed to be able to bring stability and progress to the country.
The selection of this group of ministers reflects an effort on behalf of PM Khan to unite the diverse political factions in Pakistan and create a government that can address the concerns of all citizens. It also signals a willingness among some members of the opposition to work together for the betterment of their country.
However, there are still many challenges ahead for the newly elected prime minister. One major issue will be navigating the complicated relationship between India and Pakistan. Tensions over Kashmir continue to simmer, and any misstep could lead to renewed conflict between the two nations. In addition, economic growth remains slow, unemployment rates remain high, and corruption continues to plague the system. 
PM Khan must now focus on delivering tangible results for the people of Pakistan. This includes implementing reforms in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. He also needs to tackle the issue of terrorism head-on, working closely with international partners to dismantle extremist networks and promote peace and stability throughout the region.


There are 4 politicians named A, B, C and D from different parties (Musharrafist or non-Musharaffist) each having distinct views on four issues - Economy, Terrorism, Education, Health. Each one holds one view strictly. Here we know the following facts:
1. No politician holds similar views to other ones;
2. Politician A does not support economy related policies and does not belong to same party as Person B;
3. The person supporting health policies belongs to Musharafist Party;
4. Neither person A nor D believes strongly in combating terrorism.
5. The person who supports education is either from Non-Musharafi party or is politician B.
6. Person B doesn't hold views regarding economy.  
Question: Who is the representative of which party?


By fact 1 and 2, we know that A cannot support both terrorist combat stance(as per Fact 3) and education(fact 5), hence A should believe only in Economy policy or Health Policy or Terrorism policy because it would contradict the given conditions.

Since no politician shares the exact position (Fact 6). Hence, If A believes only in Economy policy then B must believe only in Health policies because according to fact 5 the person believing in Education policy can’t belong to Musharfist party & B belongs to neither of them. Therefore A believes in Terrorism and D believes in Economy. But since A isn’t aligned with Mushrifists(from step 1), D must belong to Non-Musharifa party. So, by elimination, C must be from Mushrarfi party and thus, he/she must hold views towards Economy policy (since A, B and D already have their beliefs allocated).

Answer: A – Musharafa party – Terrorism ; B – None mentioned – Health Policies; C – Not Musharafa Party – Economy Policies;D – Non Musharifa Party – Economy Policies

Specifically, he plans to emphasize the importance of medical research, the development of new drugs and vaccines, and the improvement of access to healthcare around the world.

Despite this demand, however, Livingstone refused to back down on his claims that the prime minister had attempted to silence him through his influence within government and media outlets. 

This exchange of views comes amid increasing tensions surrounding issues relating to immigration policy and national security across the UK, with both sides accusing each other of playing political games rather than working together to find solutions. While some have criticized the Prime Minister's interference in what they see as a matter best left up to local authorities, others argue that the need for greater cooperation between different levels of governance could only be achieved if there were clear lines drawn when it came to respecting people's rights and freedoms. It appears, therefore, that the situation remains highly charged despite efforts made to de-escalate matters further.",phi2,1
"In today's political landscape, it seems that even established politicians are not immune to scrutiny. One such individual who found himself at center stage recently is former Conservative Party MP and Member of Parliament (MP), Jonathan Sayeed. Sayeed announced his resignation following allegations made against him regarding personal financial gain through private visits to Parliament. While initially denying any wrongdoing, Sayeed ultimately agreed to step down under pressure to avoid further damage to both his own reputation and the integrity of the Conservative Party. This move came just days before what would have been a tumultuous re-selection process, during which Sayeed narrowly escaped being defeated by fellow party member. With this latest development, however, Sayeed will no longer be able to take part in parliamentary proceedings or hold public office within the House of Commons.

"Tory backing for ID cards - The Tories have announced their support for controversial Government plans to introduce ID cards, despite vocal opposition from within their own ranks. A tough debate has ensued among senior Tory MPs in recent days, as they grapple with how best to approach this contentious policy proposal. But now, following an intense caucus session yesterday night, it seems that the Party is set to come out in full force in favour of introducing identification documents into everyday life in Britain.
In addition to the traditional political divisions between pro-and anti-ID card factions – those who think it’ll be useful for security purposes and those whose main objection is based around civil liberties – there were also significant divisions amongst more centrist figures such as David Cameron himself, who was forced by his colleagues to publicly state his opinion before he could even consider voting for the measure in question. In light of the strong dissent expressed during Wednesday's discussion, it looks likely that any final verdict reached at Monday evening's parliamentary vote would go down heavily against the idea being put forward by Prime Minister Gordon Brown.",phi2,1
"In Scotland, council tax rates are expected to increase by an estimated 4% next year, according to the BBC's reporting. This marks a significant departure from current levels of inflationary pressure, which stand at just 1.6%. Finance ministers have called for local authorities to rein in spending and temper their taxation plans, however it remains unclear if this will be enough to stave off rising costs.

The government itself is also being scrutinised for its potential role in driving up prices; taxes on energy and other essential goods continue to climb, while wages fail to keep pace with the accelerating cost of living. Furthermore, recent research suggests that Scottish households face an extra £100 per annum in expenses due to high-productivity businesses taking advantage of the low pound value. It is likely that these pressures will force councils into making difficult decisions around how best to allocate limited resources.

"In recent events, former UK Prime Minister Clare Short made headlines as she criticized the United States' involvement in the relief effort after the devastating Indian Ocean earthquake. In response to this criticism, the White House released a statement asserting its commitment to working alongside international partners in providing assistance to those affected by natural disasters. The president stated that the newly formed U.S.-led disaster coalition aimed at coordinating humanitarian efforts between various nations including the United States, Canada, Australia, and several Asian countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. However, Ms. Short argued against this move, suggesting it could ultimately have negative consequences for the United Nations (UN) which currently leads global disaster relief operations. 

The UN was first established following World War II with the goal of maintaining peace through multilateral cooperation and fostering economic development among developing states around the world. As the head of the organization, Secretary General Ban Ki Moon emphasized his belief that the UN is well positioned and best equipped to coordinate relief efforts globally due to its broad reach and experience managing complex crises. He also noted that while many governments were eager to assist with immediate needs like food, water, shelter, medical supplies, and cash payments, they needed more time to plan for longer term rehabilitation projects. According to him, there are often competing interests from donor groups who may prioritize their own national security concerns rather than focusing solely on the long-term rebuilding process in affected areas. Additionally, he pointed out that some foreign governments might not fully commit or follow up on previous pledges without sufficient accountability measures in place. 

Despite these challenges, Mr. Ban remained optimistic about the potential impact of coordinated action from both public and private sectors alike. By pooling resources and expertise, he believes that progress can still be made towards alleviating suffering and promoting sustainable recovery even in the face of adversity. With renewed vigor and determination, the UN remains steadfastly committed to continuing efforts toward achieving its core mission - building better lives for people all across our planet. 

US officials remain confident that their new partnership model can help expedite delivery of much needed support to victims caught amidst the aftermath of one of nature's most powerful forces. This includes leveraging innovative technologies and strategies such as satellite imagery, data analytics, and social media platforms to identify and respond rapidly to emerging threats. Meanwhile, non governmental organizations continue playing important roles too - whether offering direct services such as clean drinking water or distributing emergency goods like blankets and mosquito nets.

Kilroy-Silk declared his resignation following what he described as a betrayal from those who elected him due to the party not representing them correctly. The Brexit Party founder expressed sadness at having to leave the organization, citing its lack of respect for its members' wishes.

"The Ministry of Defence (MoD) was once again under attack today as new figures revealed that its latest major weapons programmes are costing far more than expected, while facing significant delivery delays. 

A recent National Audit Office study found that the cost of the 20 most ambitious MoD programs has surged from an estimated £41billion when they were first proposed to nearly twice that amount now – almost £77billion. This represents a staggering increase in expenditure, enough to fund three NHS hospitals or four large schools. And it comes at a time of austerity for Britain’s public services, with many local communities struggling to make ends meet due to budget cuts imposed since 2010. 

The NAO also found that delivery timescales for all but two of the programmes had missed their targets, often significantly so. For example, one program to develop the UK's next-generation fighter jet – known as the Lockheed Martin F35 Lightning II – is currently scheduled to be delivered seven years later than planned, despite being originally projected to take just five years. Such delays not only cause huge inconvenience for those involved in using the technology but can potentially put national security at risk if vital systems do not reach users in good working order in time.

In response to the findings, Shadow Secretary of State for Defence Emily Thornberry said “these findings add further weight to long standing concerns about the state of the MoD”. She continued, saying that the government needed to do much more to ensure that taxpayers money is spent wisely and effectively.

The British Army has already faced criticism in recent weeks following reports of shoddy workmanship among soldiers stationed abroad. In January, it emerged that up to half the tents used by troops serving in Afghanistan could collapse without warning because of poor construction quality control measures taken prior to shipment to theatre. More recently, thousands of army vehicles equipped with faulty brakes have come back from Iraq and Kuwait needing urgent repairs which may require them to return home early from operations this month. 

Given the scale of these problems, some members of Parliament have called for greater oversight of the MoD procurement process as well as additional resources devoted towards fixing existing issues rather than simply introducing new ones through overly generous contracts awarded to private companies. However, such calls have fallen on deaf ears thus far with neither side willing budge from where it stands on this contentious issue.",phi2,1

"Article 1 : Analysis : No Pain, No Gain? 
In recent times, there's been a new buzzword thrown around by political leaders all over the world. It’s one they use when referring to their own strategies – “no pain, no gain.” But what does this phrase actually mean? To understand its importance, we must look at how it was originally used and why politicians are continuing to employ it today.

The concept behind `No Pain, No Gain` can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy where it was believed that true progress could only come from enduring suffering or hardship. This idea has since become popularized by American writer William James who argued that hard work, sacrifice and dedication were essential if someone wanted to achieve success in life. Since then, the saying has been adopted by many people as part of their personal motivation system; they believe that any effort made towards reaching a goal will ultimately lead to greater rewards down the line.

For some politicians, using this phrase takes on a more specific meaning. They view it as their way of demonstrating resilience and strength during difficult moments while facing intense scrutiny from both public opinion and the media. In particular, Prime Minister Tony Blair recently embraced the concept himself when he went ahead with plans for further interventionism despite opposition criticism. By taking such bold action, he demonstrated not only courage but also faithfulness to his beliefs even under pressure.

So far, it appears that the use of `No Pain, No Gain` has proven successful amongst certain circles of voters. According to research conducted in 2020, those surveyed found it reassuring to see their leader willing to make tough choices regardless of whether or not they received approval beforehand. Additionally, it suggests a level of confidence among the electorate regarding their government’s ability to handle challenging situations without fear of failure.

Of course, some have raised concerns about the potential downsides associated with relying too heavily on `No Pain, No Gain`. For example, critics argue that constant exposure to stressful circumstances might weaken citizens’ trust in their elected officials due to repeated instances where promises weren't kept or expectations weren't met. Similarly, others worry that prolonged periods of difficulty may leave citizens feeling demoralised which would eventually result in apathy rather than engagement with civic affairs. Therefore, it should be remembered that although embracing hardship might sometimes yield positive outcomes, it doesn't always guarantee success.

"The UK's Government has announced plans to reduce the legal drink drive limit in an effort to make roads safer. An official study conducted by University College London suggests that lowering the limit from its current level of 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg could have significant public health benefits, saving up to 650 lives each year. This is equivalent to one death every day and six injuries every week.
 
The proposed change follows years of pressure from safety advocates who argued that the existing law was not strict enough to prevent accidents caused by driving under the influence of alcohol. In response, the Department for Transport created the Parity Taskforce to investigate the potential impacts of reducing the limit, before ultimately deciding to introduce the policy. 

The new regulation would mean drivers found with alcohol levels between 0.50% and 0.80% would face fines and potentially lose their licenses. In addition, those found to be over the lower limit when causing a fatal accident could receive a longer sentence. Supporters of the move believe it will help to deter dangerous driving, making the roadways around Britain much safer. 

The announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some critics argue that the reduced limit is too low and could lead to more people being convicted even if they were only slightly above the threshold. Others claim it doesn't go far enough, arguing that the limit should be lowered further to protect more lives. 

Despite the controversy, the government remains committed to the decision. The Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, said he welcomed the results of the Parity Taskforce and hoped that this new legislation will “make our roads safer and save lives”.
##OUTPUT
In light of recent reports suggesting that drinking and driving can be highly hazardous, the British Government has decided to implement a reduction in the legal drink drive limit in order to combat the issue. According to a study by University College London, such an alteration may save up to 650 lives annually. The new limit, which is set at 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, is significantly less than the current limit of 80 mg. 

This news has been greeted with both praise and criticism, with some questioning whether the new limit is too low while others contend it does not go far enough. Regardless of the opinion, the government remains adamant on the decision, believing that it will make the roads of England and Wales safer. It is hoped that this new legislation will reduce the number of fatalities and injuries caused by drunk driving.

"In recent news, it was announced by political analyst Andrew Marr that British Prime Minister Tony Blair intends to set a new date for the upcoming election. It is reported that Mr Blair is preparing to announce this decision soon after returning to Britain following his Easter vacation in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The announcement could come during one of the five scheduled daily television addresses given by Blair throughout this period. 

According to sources close to the Prime Minister, Mr Blair may be planning to request permission from Her Majesty's Royal Prerogative to dissolve Parliament prior to their current schedule which expires next month. This would mark a significant departure from past practice in the United Kingdom where elections must take place before dissolution of Parliament can occur. In light of such a change, many are anticipating increased scrutiny over any potential implications should an earlier general election not meet certain pre-set conditions outlined within existing legislation. 

It remains unclear what specific measures might need to be taken ahead of this move towards a more timely election date; however some analysts suggest further consideration needs to be placed upon how voter registration requirements may be adapted if polling days shift closer together than anticipated due to early Parliamentary dissolution. Additionally, there is much debate surrounding whether such changes would benefit both major party candidates – particularly those vying for leadership positions in each respective party - who currently struggle to raise necessary funds until near Election Day itself. 

Overall, while details regarding timing remain uncertain pending official announcements made later today or tomorrow afternoon (depending upon exact time frame requested), it appears that Tony Blair’s plan represents something unprecedented thus far seen within modern British electoral history. Whether this proves advantageous or disadvantageous ultimately depends largely upon outcomes resulting from related debates held among leading politicians across several governmental departments associated with various aspects including public policy implementation, campaign finance reform efforts alongside other matters pertaining solely relating directly into determining eligibility criteria needed to participate successfully during voting periods themselves. Only through continued assessment based primarily around data collection techniques utilized during subsequent phases shall we gain true insight regarding just how successful Blair’s strategy ultimately turns out proving useful beyond expectations!

"The UK's Government has set itself ambitious targets to improve literacy and numeracy rates among working-age individuals over the next five years. 
    A new report from the National Audit Office (NAO) reports that, so far, the Department for Education and Skills has reached its goal of having 750,000 adults gain basic qualifications by this date. However, an additional 1.5 million people need to achieve similar results by 2010 in order to reach the desired outcomes.

According to the NAO, one of the main factors affecting the progress towards achieving these goals is the attractiveness of available courses. To increase participation in training programs, the department should consider introducing more engaging and flexible learning materials, which could be delivered online or via mobile devices. This would allow learners to access coursework at times convenient to them and make it easier for those who have already missed out on education due to their work commitments to reenter the system. Additionally, the government should explore ways to incentivize employers to invest more heavily in upskilling their workforce, such as tax breaks or subsidies for businesses offering training opportunities to staff members. 

It is also important to note that there remains a large disparity between the number of men and women taking part in vocational training—with females disproportionately underrepresented when compared to males. To address gender gaps in skill development, policies must focus on increasing female engagement through targeted outreach strategies. These initiatives should include mentorship schemes specifically designed for aspiring professionals, as well as financial incentives tailored toward encouraging female enrollment into technical courses. By creating equal opportunities for all individuals looking to enhance their skillset, we can ensure everyone has access to meaningful career advancement possibilities regardless of age, sex, or background.

"Hundreds of protesters gather outside Parliament Building 
The sound of thousands of voices filled the air, echoing through the streets of London. It was not just any ordinary day - it was a day when people from all walks of life came together to stand up for their rights. Hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the Parliament building, holding banners and signs, chanting slogans demanding change. They were there because they believed that something needed to be done to address the issues facing their country's government.

As I walked past them, I couldn't help but admire their bravery and determination. These individuals knew the risks involved in speaking out against the powers that be, yet they were willing to put themselves on the line for what they believed in. Their passion ignited something within me, stirring a sense of hope and optimism that perhaps things could actually change.

I continued my journey towards the heart of the capital, where politicians and policymakers usually resided. However, today was different. Today, those who held positions of power seemed oblivious to the cries of the people beneath them. As I made my way inside the grand halls of Congress, I noticed an unusually large number of empty seats. There were no representatives present during this crucial time of unrest.

Confused, I approached one of the few remaining senators seated behind his desk. He looked weary and defeated, mirroring the sentiments felt by countless others in our nation's leadership. I asked him why he hadn't been attending sessions or responding to calls for assistance. His response sent chills down my spine – he explained that due to the massive strikes taking place throughout the country, even the members of congress found it difficult to attend meetings. The magnitude of the situation demanded attention beyond the confines of the Capitol.

It became apparent that the issue at hand extended far beyond mere inconvenience; it posed a genuine threat to the functioning of democracy itself. People relied heavily upon government services for various aspects of their lives, from healthcare to education, transportation, and social security benefits. With thousands striking nationwide, including civil servants in Wales, essential public functions were disrupted, causing widespread disruption and uncertainty among citizens.

News outlets were abuzz with stories detailing the impact of the strike on everyday life. Trains stood idle along their tracks, buses refused to budge despite overflowing passenger queues, and hospitals struggled to provide adequate care due to staffing shortages. The consequences reverberated throughout society, affecting everyone, regardless of political affiliation. It was evident that this strike was more than just workers standing up for their rights—it was a powerful message demanding accountability and change.

Amidst the chaos, whispers circulated among activists regarding the underlying motives driving the strike. Many speculated that the proposed budget cuts targeted vulnerable communities, exacerbating existing inequalities rather than addressing systemic problems. Civil servants expressed concerns over job losses and diminishing working conditions, while unions rallied behind fair compensation packages and improved welfare systems.

The fight for justice and equality had taken center stage, uniting individuals who may have previously disagreed on other matters. This common goal transcended party lines, fostering a spirit of solidarity that proved stronger than any division. People began recognizing that true progress required collaboration between citizens and leaders alike. Change would only come if we banded together, using collective strength to demand better policies and practices.

In the end, though the strike caused significant disruptions, its purpose remained steadfast —to draw attention to pressing societal challenges faced daily. Through peaceful protests and unwavering perseverance, millions demonstrated the power of unity and the importance of active citizen participation. By raising awareness and forcing decision-makers to confront uncomfortable truths, they paved the way for constructive dialogue and meaningful reform.

"In recent years, leaders from all corners around the world have been talking about the potential for new nations to join the European Union (EU). For many months now, the leaders of Europe's most powerful nations have been debating how to approach the subject, while others have already taken steps to begin the process. Currently, the leading voices among them are those of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. These three leadership teams met at Downing Street earlier this month to discuss their views on Turkey joining the EU. 

At the meeting, which lasted just under two hours, the trio discussed various aspects related to Turkey's application to join the EU. At the head of the agenda was Turkey's progress towards adopting the euro currency. It was unanimously agreed that Ankara should continue making strides toward fulfilling the criteria set by the eurozone countries before it would be considered eligible for membership. All three leaders concurred that the country must demonstrate its commitment to economic reforms such as improving transparency and reducing corruption if it wants to become part of the EU family. 

Moreover, the ministers debated the issue of refugees fleeing Syria into neighbouring countries such as Greece – which itself remains outside the bloc. They argued that Turkey needs more help dealing with this crisis than it currently receives and called upon the wider international community to do what it can to alleviate the situation. In addition, the British Prime Minister highlighted his enthusiasm for bringing Turkey back onto the path to becoming a full member state of the union. He noted that Turkey has historically played a pivotal role in uniting Europe during times of trouble, something which he believes should not go unrecognised. 

The meeting concluded with no clear conclusions being reached due to diverging opinions amongst the three leaders. Nevertheless, all three expressed hope that some form of agreement could eventually be struck between them. If successful, it will mark a major step forward in the long-standing effort to include Turkey in the EU.

"Oliver Letwin, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, has today dismissed suggestions that his pre-budget report indicates any imminent change in government policy on taxation or public spending. 
Letwin, speaking in Westminster, made it clear that there were no immediate plans for changes which could have significant impacts on either sector as he sought to reassure citizens of the United Kingdom regarding their financial security. 
“This announcement does not represent a major shift in our approach towards taxes or welfare benefits,"" said Letwin. “It remains very important that we continue to focus on reducing debt levels whilst ensuring essential services such as healthcare are properly funded."" 
He added that while they had taken steps this year to reduce costs, further adjustments might be necessary depending on how quickly GDP grows over the course of 2020. 
The British prime minister Boris Johnson welcomed the move by Letwin but warned against making decisions too soon due to uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Johnson commented, saying ""We must remain mindful of the potential risks posed by new variants of coronavirus so that all Britons can feel secure knowing their finances will remain protected"". 
Although some analysts believe that this announcement suggests little realignment from current political strategy, others suggested that certain aspects of the budget may indicate future moves in terms of taxation policy. David Greenaway, director of research at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), noted that while it appears there will likely still be no increase in fuel duties - despite calls from environmental campaigners – other areas such as capital gains tax might face cuts if inflation continues to rise rapidly. 
These comments came after Prime Minister Johnson announced earlier in the day that the UK Treasury expects Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% next quarter compared to 2.4% during the last three months of 2019.

These tensions were further exacerbated by rumours of potential disagreements regarding the timing of future elections. However, amidst this turmoil, Mr Blair made it clear during his address to members of the House of Commons last night (Monday) that he is committed to uniting all Labour MPs behind the party's efforts to seek another three years in office following its defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats in December 2005. 
Mr Blair addressed concerns among some backbench Members of Parliament who had voiced dissatisfaction with Labour policies or felt sidelined due to Mr Brown’s increasing prominence within the inner circle. He assured them that his primary concern remains maintaining stability both inside and outside government, as well as ensuring the smooth functioning of the country. In particular, he emphasised his commitment towards strengthening relationships across different factions within the party – particularly those representing working-class individuals from industrial areas like the West Midlands or Yorkshire – in order to prevent any divisions which might undermine Labour’s prospects ahead of the forthcoming national assembly elections scheduled for June 2007. 

	Despite such assurances, however, many remain sceptical of whether such measures can be successful given the long history of infighting amongst former colleagues and the deep political differences which still exist even after nearly two decades since their respective retirements; not least owing to the factionalism caused by the infamous ‘penny vote’ scandal of 2001.

This comes after days of devastating images from Indonesian cities near the coast that were hit by an massive earthquake and subsequent tidal wave. 

The death toll across the region is estimated to be over two thousand, with more than a hundred thousand people reported missing. Military personnel from international coalition forces are deployed in the area, supported by air cover from British Aerospace Sea Harriers and other planes of the Royal Air Force. Their mission is to help rescue survivors, deliver aid and establish temporary shelter for those affected by the disaster. 

The UK's offer of Gurkhas it is seen as a positive step towards helping out, particularly given the close relationship between the two countries. It also marks a special tribute to all those who have died in the tragedy, as the Gurkhas have a long history of military service around the world. 

The deployment of the Gurkhas could not come at a better time. With limited resources and infrastructure in the aftermath of the disaster, every contribution counts and the Gurkhas' training and experience make them invaluable assets in the relief effort. 

The Gurkhas themselves are eager to get to work and provide assistance where needed. Not only does it allow them to use their skills and expertise to give back to the community they served so faithfully, it also provides them with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.

It is crucial for them, according to Fox, that lessons are learned from past mistakes so that they do not happen again. 

In response to Lord Archer's request, Fox acknowledged that the decision lies solely with him and the Conservative leadership team. They must carefully evaluate each individual application based on their merits rather than succumbing to external pressure. The ultimate goal, as Fox explained, remains the same - maintaining trust among party members and ensuring that those elected represent the interests of the people effectively.

"Ministers lose slopping out case - A recent ruling by Scotland's High Court of Justiciary has found in favor of armed convict Robert Napier and awarded him £2,490 in damages. The prisoner had applied for compensation following a claim that forcing inmates to perform the task of slopping out caused him severe physical discomfort and psychological distress. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that Mr Napier's condition could have been avoided if proper measures were taken to reduce the risk associated with slopping out activities (Environment Minister & others v Robert Andrew Napier [2021] SCHC 11). 

The case brought attention to the ongoing debate on whether or not prisons should provide more sanitary facilities to minimize health risks faced by convicts while living inside correctional centers. It also highlighted the need for authorities to consider the mental and emotional well-being of those incarcerated rather than just focusing on punishment. In addition, it raised concerns regarding the quality of healthcare offered to prisoners and how inadequate services can adversely affect individuals who are already facing difficult circumstances due to their criminal convictions.""

"The United Kingdom's former prime minister, Tony Blair, has expressed deep concern over recent comments made by London Mayor Ken Livingston. The remarks were seen as offensive and hurtful towards the Jewish community, leading to calls from Blair himself that the mayor take responsibility for them.
`` I am deeply troubled by what happened,'' Blair said in a statement released late yesterday night. ``I believe it was unacceptable behaviour and I think the mayor needs to apologize for what was said.""''

	Livingston responded to the criticism by saying he stands behind his remark - which compared the journalist to someone running a Nazi-run prison camp. He also defended the comparison by stating that journalists often have to make tough decisions when reporting news stories, even if they may not always please everyone involved. Despite this, however, some are calling for him to withdraw his statements or issue a formal apology.'' 

	In response, Blair went further than simply asking for an apology and called for more action. “What’s needed here isn't only apologies but concrete measures taken against those responsible for hate speech such as racism,"" he added. ``We need to ensure our democracy remains strong and free from discrimination of any kind.''

"Michael Howard, former Prime Minister of United Kingdom and leader of the British Conservatives, has been described by his predecessor, Peter Hain, as being “attack[ed]”. This statement sparked controversy and further discussion on the political climate during that time.
 
In response to this accusation, Howard gave a rebuttal during the annual Spring Conference held at the University of Brighton, which he attended alongside other members of parliament including Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The speech began with Howard saying:

```I have always believed that it is important for leaders within our community to remain focused on their core values''
This statement reflects Howard's commitment towards maintaining principles that are essential for successful leadership. Despite facing criticism and attacks, he remained steadfast and true to those beliefs.
However, there were still some who disagreed with his views. For instance, Labour MP Chris Smith argued that Howard should focus more on social issues rather than economic policies. On the contrary, John Prescott defended Howard's stance on economic matters while acknowledging its importance. These differing opinions demonstrate how individuals can hold varying perspectives even when discussing similar topics.

"The controversy surrounding proposed changes in government policy have left many politicians speaking out. In response, Conservative Prime Minister Tony Blair stood firm and refused to reverse his earlier announcement that new identity documents were being introduced. This move has been met with criticism from across all parties, particularly from within his own party. 

One of the main points of contention is whether or not the identification cards should be issued by the government, instead of being voluntary. While some argue that this would increase security, others worry about the potential for abuse and invasion of privacy. Additionally, there are concerns that those who cannot afford to obtain the cards will be unfairly targeted by law enforcement agencies. 

To further complicate matters, different factions within the Liberal Democrats have taken contrasting stances on the issue. Some members, such as former deputy leader Charles Kennedy, have expressed their opposition to the plan while other more liberal-leaning MPs appear to be in favor. 

This difference of opinion has caused tension between various political parties as well as within the Conservative Party itself, prompting questions regarding unity and solidarity at a time when public confidence in the government’s ability to make sound decisions appears to be waning.

"In a groundbreaking announcement, Home Secretary David Blunkett has revealed his ambitious plans to revolutionize policing in England and Wales. Under this new initiative, every individual will have access to vital information through their very own personal mobile phones - including their nearest neighborhood's local police officer.

The proposed reform introduces a revolutionary concept called 'Neighbourhood Policing', which aims to establish specialized teams within communities to enhance law enforcement capabilities and build stronger relationships between citizens and the police force. Each neighborhood will now boast its very own dedicated unit, staffed with highly trained officers who are intimately familiar with the unique challenges faced by residents.

To ensure accountability and transparency, the government intends to implement a comprehensive set of ten core values known as the 'Compulsory Customer Charter'. This code of conduct sets clear expectations of both the community and the police department, guaranteeing that all interactions adhere to professional standards while upholding democratic principles such as freedom of speech, privacy rights, and equality before the law. By making adherence to this charter mandatory across all police forces nationwide, the hope is that trust and mutual respect can flourish on both sides.

Under Mr. Blunkett's leadership, specific performance benchmarks will be established, aiming to guarantee prompt responses to emergency calls and other urgent matters. These measurable goals aim not only to improve efficiency but also foster a culture where individuals feel safe knowing they can rely on swift action when needed. Moreover, it is expected that the introduction of Neighborhood Police Teams combined with robust communication channels, such as hotlines or online portals, will encourage proactive engagement from residents reporting any concerns, fostering collaboration towards building safer neighborhoods.

This bold vision of a more inclusive society extends beyond just the implementation of Neighbourhood Policing. A significant portion of resources allocated under Mr. Blunkett's plan seeks to address social disparities, investing heavily in initiatives aimed at tackling crime hotspots prevalent among marginalized groups, ensuring equal protection and justice for everyone, regardless of background or socioeconomic status.

Critics argue that such radical changes may disrupt existing protocols, leading to unforeseen consequences and potential delays in critical operations. However, proponents maintain that embracing change is essential if we wish to evolve into modern societies capable of effectively addressing emerging threats like organized crime and terrorism. It is hoped that these measures will strengthen community ties, bolster trust, and ultimately contribute to reducing fear and anxiety related to safety issues.

David Blunkett remains committed to transforming the way our police services operate. He firmly believes that by granting greater power directly to the people and establishing localized units rooted in knowledge of the area, we can create a system designed specifically around the needs and aspirations of our diverse population. With unwavering determination and support from the nation, he envisions an era where the British public feels secure, confident that their voices matter, and no one falls victim to the clutches of criminal activity.

"Charles Kennedy had always been passionate about social justice, and he saw firsthand how hardworking families struggled under an oppressive taxation regime. He spoke out against the government's inaction on tackling this issue and criticized George Bush during the presidential election campaign in 2004 when he called him out at the Democratic National Convention. 

	When the Labour party came into power later that year, Kennedy thought things would finally improve. But after nine Budgets, there seemed to be little progress made towards addressing the problem. Even worse, those who needed financial help most - such as pensioners - were still being let down by an unfair system of taxation which favored the wealthy over everyone else. 
	The latest budget from Chancellor Gordon Brown only served to make matters worse, with its failure to address the underlying issues. Despite promises to do something, the government refused to take meaningful action. That is why Kennedy felt so strongly that the situation deserved attention - not just because it affected ordinary people but also due to the wider implications it held for economic inequality. 
	It wasn't just about making sure the poor paid less; it was about fairness too. Everyone should pay their fair share according to their ability, regardless of whether they are rich or poor. And yet here we were, with some groups continuing to shoulder an unfairly large burden while others enjoyed excessive privileges. This simply couldn't continue if Britain was ever going to become truly equitable. 
	So what could be done? In order to create real change, politicians must start listening to the voices of the disadvantaged. They need to recognize the importance of taking a long-term view rather than focusing solely on short term solutions. They have to acknowledge the complexity of the problems involved and come up with comprehensive strategies that will benefit all citizens without leaving anyone behind. 
	Only then can we hope to see true reform and lasting success in our efforts to build a fairer society where no one is left struggling. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to ensure that the gap between the rich and the poor doesn’t keep growing larger every day – especially now when the world needs us most!",phi2,1
"Mandelson Warning To BBC: Don't Demonize Former Downing Street Media Chief. 
The BBC must avoid “demonizing” Alastair Campbell, the former head of Britain's Prime Minister's office, according to EU Commissioner and former British Labor Party MP, Peter Mandelson. This comes following accusations made against Campbell of being involved in a “dirty tricks” operation within the party during his time in government. 

Campbell, it seems, had developed an unpopular reputation among certain members of the press due to his tactics for manipulating public opinion. His methods included spreading false information, making use of personal attacks, and creating negative coverage of political opponents. Despite this, he continued to be one of the most influential figures in Conservative policymaking throughout the 2000s until he decided to step down at the end of 2009. 

Nevertheless, the allegations made against him have caused a stir amongst both the Tory and Labour parties, with many accusing the latter of using their resources to try to damage Campbell's reputation while simultaneously attempting to undermine opposition candidates through various means, including smear campaigns. These tactics have been described as having crossed ethical boundaries, and could potentially amount to election interference. 

In response to the growing criticism surrounding these issues, Mandelson has issued his sternest warning yet to broadcasters over how they handle matters concerning political opponents. According to the Commission, any broadcaster which engages in such behaviour will face repercussions; specifically the possibility of losing its broadcasting license if the situation escalates further. 

It remains to be seen whether or not the BBC will heed the warnings given by Mandelson however, considering the current climate between both parties and their respective stances on the matter. With tensions high and emotions running strong, only time will tell what actions will ultimately take place next.

"In his speech, Karen was able to highlight the dangers of state terrorism and oppressive regimes around the world. He called for action from the global community to ensure human rights are protected and upheld. 

Karen highlighted that the rise of extreme right-wing governments over the past few years has set back progress made in the realm of international human rights. From democracies being overturned to authoritarian leaders denying basic services to their citizens, the world has seen an unsettling wave of violations of human rights. 

He went on to create a checklist for identifying potential atrocities, urging people to be aware of the signs of oppressive behavior and to stay vigilant against it. Furthermore, he discussed the importance of holding those responsible for human rights abuses accountable, citing the example of the Syrian government's execution of thousands of political prisoners. 

Karen concluded by making a call to action. To protect human rights globally, he suggested increasing financial support for humanitarian organizations, passing more comprehensive anti-discrimination laws, and creating international tribunals to hold dictators accountable for their crimes. He ended by emphasizing the importance of global solidarity in order to build a world where human rights are respected, and no one is subjected to oppression.

"The defiant hunts put an immediate stop to the test for those who had long opposed the legislation. With thousands of hunters heading out from all corners across England and Wales, the new laws imposed by the Coalition Government caused quite a stir. Hunting with dogs was once again made illegal, and this time it seemed that no amount of convincing would be enough to sway those not enamored with the idea. 

Despite being banned since 1992, hunting has remained popular among some; however, the government's recent decisions appeared to solidify their stance against the activity. To ensure enforcement of the ban, the Police were sent onto Britain's countryside and villages during daylight hours, in search of offenders. Those caught taking part in the forbidden sport will face fines up to £5,000 and even imprisonment. 

Since the change took effect the morning before yesterday, thousands of hunt supporters have gathered at designated sites. The Countryside Alliance held its traditional meeting near Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire where they declared defiance towards the new regulations. They pledged to abide by the law despite their protests, showing just how committed they are when it comes to preserving what they view as a cultural tradition. This attitude of defiance was shared throughout the country as many celebrated the end of a chapter in British history, while simultaneously celebrating the start of something else – the beginning of another era where human beings can co-exist peacefully alongside nature instead of exploiting it.

"Tory MPs have revealed their tough stance towards migrants, proposing mandatory health checks upon entry into the United Kingdom. The policy aims at protecting public health as well as reducing pressure on resources within the National Health Service (NHS). Under the proposed legislation, non-EU citizens seeking to enter the country legally will be required to submit to medical examinations that check for tuberculosis and HIV. 
A successful outcome of the exam is needed to validate a person’s visa application and any refusal due to ill health could result in rejection of the application or other penalties. It is hoped that this measure will discourage people from migrating to Britain solely for economic reasons, which has been a persistent issue in recent years. The decision was met with criticism from several parties and industry leaders who argued that such policies could create unnecessary barriers to immigration and lead to discrimination against certain ethnic groups. 
Despite the backlash, Prime Minister John Smith defended his government’s position and stated that ensuring public safety should take precedence over political considerations. He acknowledged concerns that the measures may not address all aspects of the problem but insisted they were an important step forward in tackling illegal migration. Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards when it comes to safeguarding public health – noting that unchecked diseases can spread quickly throughout communities and pose serious risks to vulnerable populations.
The Conservative Party has previously announced its intention to crack down on those entering the UK without proper documentation. In addition, ministers are considering introducing tougher border controls designed to reduce the number of illegal crossings along the Calais route. Such steps reflect growing unease among politicians regarding uncontrolled population growth caused by unrestricted access granted through Europe's open borders policy.
It remains to be seen whether such drastic actions are effective solutions given complex social issues surrounding immigration reform; however one thing is clear—the Tories' willingness to tackle problems head-on sets them apart from rivals in terms of commitment and ambition."" OUTPUT: The text above provides a comprehensive overview of the Tory party's latest proposal to enforce stricter regulations on immigrants entering the UK. With a focus on both protecting public health and preserving national security, the announcement seeks to curb the flow of individuals coming into the country for various purposes, including employment opportunities. The policy also highlights the need to ensure fair treatment of potential workers regardless of nationality or ethnicity - something that is often lacking today due to lax enforcement mechanisms in place. This move marks a decisive moment in British politics where hardline stances toward immigration have become increasingly commonplace across Western democracies around the world. By taking proactive action now, it appears that the Tories hope to deter further influxes of unwanted guests looking to make use of our generous welfare system without contributing back enough financially or socially towards sustaining society at large.",phi2,1
"In his recent speech in Parliament, Lord Chancellor Liz Truss made an announcement that there will be significant changes coming to the highest court system in England. At present, the position of Lord Chancellor holds both political and judicial titles; however, from now on this role will exclusively focus on the political side of things. 

Lord Truss said “The best person for the job should be chosen based on their political experience, rather than their knowledge of law or their background in public service”. This means that the individual appointed to the new lordship will need to have a strong understanding of policy-making as well as an extensive network of connections inside government. It also implies that the next Lord Chancellor may come from outside of the traditional legal profession, possibly even from the world of business. 

This decision by Lord Truss raises some interesting questions about the future direction of the English legal system. Will judges feel undermined by the removal of the judicial element from the Lord Chancellor's title? And how much influence will politicians have over decisions being made within the judiciary? 

These are just some of the concerns raised by Lord Truss' announcement, and only time will tell what the consequences of this change will be. One thing is certain, though—the appointment of the lord chancellor does not require any particular qualifications other than those necessary to hold a political office. Thus, it remains to be seen who will ultimately fill the position and lead England's Supreme Court into the uncertain times ahead.

2. According to sources close to the investigation, the leaked budget information was discovered when it was found that certain key figures had been included in documents prior to Chancellor Alistair Darling's official announcement at 10am this morning. 
3. It has since emerged that much of the content published by the Financial Times earlier than expected is from papers owned or linked to individuals affiliated with both Labour and Conservative parties - raising questions around potential political influence over the release of economic forecasts and other sensitive data.
4. In response to the allegations being levelled against them, officials from the Treasury confirmed today (Monday) there had indeed been some discrepancies between what was planned to be announced by Mr Darling and material appearing ahead of time in publications such as the Telegraph and FT. However the department added that no wrongdoing took place beyond standard protocol governing pre-publication reviews within Government departments themselves.
5. This comes after reports last week suggested that ministers may have gone so far as trying to manipulate press coverage leading up to Tuesday's Budget announcement through tactics including providing confidential briefings only to select journalists while simultaneously releasing non-essential information online hours before Prime Minister David Cameron stepped forward himself with remarks aimed squarely at opposing views contained within various newspapers' editorial sections.

"Tessa Jones, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media, and Sport, rejected recent reports that suggested the government was planning to introduce large scale ‘Las Vegas style’ super casinos. In an exclusive interview with BBC News, Jones made it clear that such plans had not been approved by the British government, adding that they were focused instead on introducing tighter regulations on existing gambling establishments. 

This is great news for those who have expressed concern over the potential social impacts of allowing high-stakes gaming venues to operate freely. While some have argued that such facilities could help revitalize deprived areas by providing jobs and boosting local revenue, many public figures have voiced their opposition to the idea, fearing that it could lead to increased addiction, crime and other social issues.

The new laws will focus on protecting vulnerable individuals from excessive risk by setting limits on how much money can be bet per session and requiring casinos to employ extra staff to monitor customer activity. This should also help reduce abuse within the industry, since operators will need to ensure that all customers are aged 21 or older and comply with the law’s provisions before being allowed access to any type of betting service.

At this stage, it remains unclear what specific measures will actually be included within the legislation; however, given the level of controversy surrounding this issue so far, it seems likely that tough restrictions will be imposed to protect consumers while still allowing them enjoy themselves responsibly.

"The government has recently made a statement regarding two British citizens, John and James Smith, who were both released from Guantánamo Bay. According to reports, the Department for Exiting the European Union (DEEU) have informed the men that their United Kingdom passports will no longer be issued due to the evidence provided by the US government. This decision comes as a shock to many since the men had been previously granted political asylum in the UK on account of their involvement in protests against US military activities in the Middle East and Africa. 

For years now, the men had been living freely in the UK under the protection of its immigration laws, however, this status seemed set to change after the recent announcement from the DEEU. In addition to the denial of their UK passports, the department also stated that any further attempts by the men to travel outside of Europe must first obtain permission from an official government authority. This means that even though John and James have already returned home to the UK, they are still prohibited from travelling abroad without explicit permission from the state.

This development is seen by some as yet another example of the UK’s increasingly restrictive stance towards migrants and refugees. Many critics argue that the new regulations represent an unjustified interference in the rights of individuals to move around the world and conduct business across national borders. Furthermore, there are concerns that such policies could potentially lead to greater levels of xenophobia and racism within society.

On the other hand, supporters of the policy point out that the UK needs to protect itself from potential threats posed by foreign agents. They claim that granting citizenship and/or residence permits to those suspected of being involved in hostile actions can put UK nationals at risk of harm and danger. Moreover, they suggest that denying access to UK passports may serve as a deterrent to anyone considering engaging in terrorism-related activities.

Despite all arguments, it is clear that the situation remains uncertain for both John and James, as well as other immigrants currently residing in the UK. Only time will tell how this issue plays out over the next few months and whether the DEEU's decisions will stand up to legal scrutiny. For the moment, we can only hope that justice will prevail and that the fundamental rights of those affected will remain protected.

"'Brown appeals for political unity amid division over leadership.' 

    The Chancellor of Britain, Gordon Brown, is facing growing criticism and calls for his resignation as divisions within his own party threaten to tear apart the coalition government. 

	According to several sources, former Prime Minister Tony Blair has broken his promise to step aside before the upcoming general elections. This move comes amidst increasing tensions between Blair and his deputy John Prescott who have been at odds since their last Cabinet meeting earlier this year. 

	In response to these allegations, Brown released a statement calling for unity among all members of parliament. He stated that it's essential that they work together to tackle the pressing issues facing the nation such as rising unemployment rates and economic uncertainty caused by the global financial crisis. 

	Despite expressing concern about the situation, however, Brown declined to provide further details on what steps might be taken should there continue to be disagreements among Coalition partners. Instead, he reiterated his commitment towards maintaining strong relationships throughout the parliamentary term until 2015 when new elections could take place if needed. 

	Labour Party leader Ed Miliband responded quickly following the Chancellor's comments, accusing both Blair and Prescott of trying to undermine Brown through behind-the-scenes maneuvers aimed directly against him personally - although he failed to mention any evidence supporting this claim specifically. 

	As public opinion shifts increasingly away from the current ruling party due to lacklustre results during recent local polls held across England and Scotland alike (including those which had initially indicated significant gains for them), pressure seems likely to mount even higher upon Brown himself now than ever previously seen so far. It will remain unclear how long it takes for any concrete solutions regarding these matters to emerge though; while some may feel optimistic given the willingness shown thus far amongst various politicians involved here, others are more skeptical considering the magnitude of problems present currently surrounding British society.""""""

The commission believes that currently, there are other measures in place that make it difficult for those who wish to donate significantly more than the average person. These include public disclosure requirements and limits on individual contributions. However, the issue remains controversial as some argue that without a caps, wealthy individuals will continue to have an outsized influence on the political process. 

The electioneering season has been so far largely free from significant issues regarding campaign financing. Unlike past years, there have been no major scandals surrounding illegal or unethical fundraising practices. This is likely due to increased scrutiny from the electoral commission and other oversight bodies. 

However, the problem of wealthy donors having too much sway over politicians' decisions remains a pressing concern for many citizens. Political candidates rely heavily on financial support in order to run successful campaigns, making them vulnerable to manipulation by special interest groups. 

Many suggest that a donor cap could help reduce this risk by discouraging excessively generous contributions from any single source. There is also evidence to suggest that such a measure would lead to greater transparency in the way money is raised for political purposes, allowing voters to better understand where their elected representatives're getting their funding from.

Nevertheless, critics of a potential donor cap point out that it might hinder legitimate charitable giving and prevent well-informed donors from supporting causes they care about. Additionally, imposing such restrictions could create an uneven playing field between larger organizations and smaller charities when competing for political attention or resources.

"Political tensions were high as hundreds took part in a peaceful protest call for an end to the Iraq War. Despite their efforts, security forces denied permission for the march on Saturday afternoon, citing public order concerns and safety issues. 

The protest had been planned for weeks, with organizers hoping to make a statement and push government officials to change their stance on the war. But instead, they were met with resistance at every turn. 

Many participants felt betrayed by local authorities who had agreed to let them hold the rally only hours earlier. Some even accused the police of using excessive force during the dispersal of crowds last week. 

A spokesperson for the organisers said they were deeply disappointed but would continue to fight for what they believed in. “We will not be deterred by this setback,” she added. 

Meanwhile, those in support of the government's position remained unimpressed. They argued that the protesters posed too great a risk to national security and could cause widespread disruption if allowed to go ahead as originally intended. 

This is just one example of the growing divide between those who believe the Iraq War should stay and those who think we should bring our troops home now. It remains to be seen whether either side will back down in the coming months – or if this conflict will rage on indefinitely. 

With tensions running high, only time will tell what happens next…

"The announcement came in a statement from the UK Parliament. It stated that after careful consideration, the proposed bill by Labour Peer Lord David Dubs was dropped due to its unpopularity and lack of support within the government. 
The news comes as a surprise to many, considering the efforts that were made to advance the cause of equality, particularly for women. According to reports, Lord Dunlop had suggested an amendment to the existing law which would allow females in the royal family to inherit the crown on an equal footing with their brothers. The move was met with opposition from the majority of conservatives and pro-life groups who argued that it went against long-established traditions and could potentially disrupt the stability of the monarchy. Despite this opposition, Lady Diana Spencer supported the idea of gender equality in the royal family at one point in time. 
However, despite his efforts, Lord Davids decision to withdraw the proposed bill means that the issue remains unresolved. This is seen as a major setback for those fighting for greater representation and fairness inside the House of Lords. Many are now questioning whether the current political climate will ever be able to produce meaningful change when it comes to gender issues. 
It remains to be seen if other countries will follow suit and begin to address the unequal treatment of men and women when it comes to constitutional entitlement. Only time will tell if such changes will be implemented or remain mere suggestions. In the meantime, the debate over gender equity in the United Kingdom continues to simmer, while those involved hope for more progress on this important matter.

"In recent times, immigration has become one of the most contentious topics in global politics. With massive population movements due to social and economic reasons such as poverty and conflict, immigration has become a major factor in political debates across the world. The UK is no exception, with the current Prime Minister David Cameron having declared that immigration should be a top priority for his government. This announcement has sparked an debate between those who advocate for higher levels of immigration and those who believe immigration needs to be controlled. 

The current Conservative Government's approach to immigration has been heavily criticized by both major parties. The Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg, have argued that current levels of immigration are unsustainable and need to be reduced urgently. Furthermore, the British Medical Journal had warned of the negative impact of high levels of immigration on healthcare systems. Meanwhile, the Labor Party has seen its support erode among the public due to strong opposition to the Current Prime Minister's policies.

This unexpected move comes as no surprise considering Jackson's close ties to former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his long history of supporting progressive economic reforms. 
Jackson's defection was meticulously planned over several months, ensuring maximum impact and confusion within the political sphere. His timing coincides with the release of Michael Howard's much-anticipated speech outlining plans for increased taxation and government expenditure. By announcing his departure before Howard unveils his proposals, Jackson aims to undermine the Conservatives' credibility and position himself as an alternative leader who can offer fresh ideas and solutions to pressing issues facing the country.

"The Plaid Cymru Member of Parliament (MP), Elfyn Llwyd, thinks that there might be truth behind the claims made by the media regarding the recent fires set in the United Kingdom. He suggests that the country's intelligence and defense agencies may have been responsible for the series of incendiary activities which took place over a decade ago. In particular, he cites an incident from two decades ago when members of the organization Meibion Glyndwr started setting off explosive devices around several areas across Wales. The party was thought to blame extremist groups within the region; however, no one had ever actually confirmed their involvement until now. 
Elfyn Llwyd points out how similar tactics are being used today – instead of explosives, they seem to be using more sophisticated methods like arson attacks against prominent political figures who oppose the idea of remaining part of the union with England. This type of attack can easily sway public opinion towards those who support nationalism while also giving them a sense of justice due to the lack of evidence available to back up their accusations. 
It remains unclear whether such actions take place without any permission or guidance from authorities, but it seems likely given the timing of each event closely follows the release of new legislation concerning Brexit negotiations between Britain and Europe. With so much at stake politically right now, many people believe someone must be trying to influence public sentiment through whatever means necessary – regardless if those measures involve violence or not. Whether this particular case will result in further investigations into potential misconduct among officials remains yet to be seen.

"In recent years, the issue of terrorism has become increasingly prevalent on many people's minds. With the rise of global terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, governments around the world have been struggling to contain their influence. In 2013, the United States launched its drone program, which has since carried out over 1,200 strikes against militants in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. Despite its success, the drone program has drawn criticism from various human rights groups, who argue that it violates international law and results in civilian casualties.
The controversy surrounding the drone program reached new heights when it was revealed that the CIA had used secret prisons to hold detainees without charge or trial. The most infamous of these facilities was Guantanamo Bay detention camps in Cuba, where more than 700 men were held for extended periods without access to legal representation or due process. It wasn't until 2009 that President Obama ordered the closure of the prison complex.
However, one detainee who spent three decades behind bars did not give up hope. His name was Martin Mubanga and he had recently filed a lawsuit against both the American government and MI6 (the UK's Secret Intelligence Service). According to a report by The Observer, Mr Mubanga claims that an MI6 officer played a crucial role in sending him to Guantánamo Bay after his arrest in Zambia. He alleges that this individual provided false information to the FBI, leading them to believe that Mr Mubanga posed a threat to national security.
Mr Mubanga went into further detail, stating that while imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay, he endured beatings and humiliation at the hands of U.S. guards. He also alleged that during interrogations, agents would use waterboarding and other forms of torture to extract confessions. These allegations come just weeks before the 20th anniversary of the start of the war on terror, highlighting how far we still have to go before ensuring basic civil liberties are respected across all nations.
Despite his harrowing experiences, Martin Mubanga remains determined to bring justice to those responsible for his mistreatment. If successful with his claim against both the US government and MI6 then it could set an important precedent for similar cases throughout history – demonstrating that even though power may exist within certain institutions they must always adhere to established laws and regulations regarding prisoner treatment.""

"In an unsettling move, UK Independence Party (UKIP) has taken action against one of their own candidates. A recent investigation revealed that John Houston, a 54-year-old aspiring politician from Scotland's East Kilbride district, had been expelled from UKIP on suspicion of making inflammatory remarks regarding mental health and criminal activities. These comments were forwarded by the Scottish Daily Mail and Evening Telegraph to two local journalists. 
Houston's suspension raises questions surrounding extremism within UKIP and the potential impact it may have on upcoming elections. The expulsion comes as no surprise given the controversial nature of some of his statements over time - ranging from advocating for Britain's reemergence into the European Union, which is currently experiencing significant turmoil following Brexit, to proposing the extermination or containment measures for individuals deemed mentally unfit. Such sentiments are far removed from mainstream political discourse. However, they serve as stark reminders of how radicalization can take place even among members of established parties.
John Houston's candidacy drew considerable attention ahead of this year’s election cycle, as he positioned himself as a staunch opponent of EU integration, pledging instead to work toward greater sovereignty and independence for the United Kingdom. This stance resonated strongly with many voters disillusioned with Brussels' policies. Despite gaining popularity amongst UKIP supporters, Houston faced scrutiny early on during his campaign due to allegations of involvement in extremist organizations. His past associations with such groups cast doubts upon his credibility and raised concerns about his ability to represent diverse constituents effectively. While the full extent of his affiliations remains unclear, it underscores the need for thorough vetting processes when selecting candidates for public office. 
The decision to suspend Houston stems from accusations stemming from leaked documents obtained by investigative journalist Peter Preston earlier today. Among the papers shared with reporters included a draft interview script featuring several potentially disturbing quotes attributed to Houston. In one instance, a passage suggests that criminals suffering from severe mental illness ought to face violent retribution. Shockingly, these chilling suggestions echo extreme ideologies associated with far-right movements across Europe. Moreover, another document contains excerpts supposedly written by Houston, highlighting his support for restoring elements of colonialism and promoting imperialism. It is important to note that both sources lack concrete evidence linking them directly to Houston. Nevertheless, the mere possibility of him espousing such regressive ideas demands further examination.
As tensions escalate within UKIP and wider society, calls for accountability and transparency intensify. Many question whether the expulsion of a prominent member like John Houston serves as merely symbolic posturing, aiming to appease conservative factions while simultaneously diverting attention away from internal divisions within the party. Critics argue that rather than addressing these contentious issues head-on, leaders might choose to silence dissenting voices through selective suspensions and expulsions. Furthermore, there are worries concerning the broader implications of allowing such rhetoric and extremist beliefs to infiltrate the democratic process. If unchecked, extremists could exploit the vulnerability created by divisive tactics employed by populist figures to gain traction among disenchanted citizens. As history has shown us too often, dangerous ideologies flourish under circumstances where legitimate grievances go unaddressed.
While the specifics of John Houston's case remain contested and subject to ongoing investigations, its significance cannot be underestimated. By suspending a prominent UKIP figure accused of endorsing abhorrent views towards marginalized communities and individuals struggling with mental illness, the party risks alienating large portions of its base and damaging its long-term viability. The challenge lies in balancing ideological differences while upholding core principles of democracy and respect for all citizens, regardless of their background. Only time will tell if UKIP manages to navigate this treacherous path successfully – but one thing is certain; the consequences of inaction could reverberate beyond party lines, impacting the very fabric of our nation's social cohesion.

"The terror attacks in recent months have left people feeling powerless. From New York City’s Twin Towers collapsing, killing almost 3 thousand innocent victims within two minutes on September 11th 2001, through to London's 7/7 bombings which killed nearly 50 persons, leaving more than 500 injured, it seems as if terrorists know no borders or boundaries when it comes to carrying out their heinous acts of violence. 

	Lord Falconer recently addressed this very issue when he spoke to reporters following an emergency meeting convened by Prime Minister Tony Blair after the July 21st 2005 London bombing. At the press conference, Falconer stressed the need for “tough measures” such as control orders to combat radicalization among individuals who may be vulnerable to being influenced by extremist groups like al-Qaeda or the Taliban. He went further to argue that such initiatives could help prevent potential acts of terrorism before they even occur. 

However, despite his seemingly supportive comments towards introducing stricter policies involving detention and surveillance, Falconer still managed to raise concerns over what some are calling a “police state”, claiming that it would set a dangerous precedent and lead to a slippery slope of authoritarianism and oppression. 

It is clear from Lord Falconer's comments that while he recognizes and sympathizes with those affected by terrorism, he also wants to ensure that citizens remain safe without sacrificing too much of their rights. To achieve this delicate balancing act, it will take a great deal of collaboration between politicians, law enforcement agencies and society at large to create an effective policy framework capable of tackling extremism in all its forms – something that can only be achieved through open dialogue and understanding.

"The latest news brings more disappointment to British voters as it has been announced that former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, will refuse to participate in a televised debate prior to the upcoming elections. 

Tony Blair made the announcement on his monthly news briefing, saying he had no interest in engaging in such a confrontation with his opponents. His reason cited was his previous successes in electoral campaigns where he managed to win without participating in debates. 

Former Conservative Leader, Michael Howard, also weighed into the debate, criticizing Tony Blair's decision and attempting to undermine his chances of success in the coming election. Despite his efforts, it appears that Tony Blair remains committed to his strategy of avoiding a face-to-face showdown with the opposition. 

This news analysis further reinforces the notion that the current state of UK politics is one of decline and disarray.

After months of failing to reach an agreement, MPs from different parties have come together to propose reforms to the House of Commons.

The proposed changes include a reduction of the House of Lords to 70% elected members. This will bring more balance to the Parliament, allowing for greater representation of the people. Additionally, the elected members will be chosen by party leaders rather than existing lords and knights.

This groundbreaking decision was made after weeks of tense negotiations between the two houses of parliament. What once seemed impossible is now being pursued with vigor by many MPs.

"In the wake of the devastating Hatfield rail crash, four individuals have been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. The accident occurred on June 13th, 2000 when an out-of-control freight service collided with passenger trains near Hatfield, resulting in the loss of four lives and numerous injuries. 

The investigation into the incident concluded that negligence by both Hatfield station personnel and a Balfour Beatty railway staff member were major contributing factors to the catastrophe. Balfour Beatty's Railway Maintenance subsidiary had oversight responsibility for managing and maintaining the track along which the derailment took place. 

Anthony Walker, former head of operations at Balfour Beatty, and his colleague Nicholas Jefferies, who managed railway engineering services, will face charges related to gross neglect and failure to properly maintain safety standards within their respective positions. Both men pleaded guilty during pre-trial hearings before being convicted last month. 

Their sentencing has sent shockwaves throughout the country as it is believed this may be the first time such severe penalties have been imposed following a fatal railroad mishap. It also brings attention to the larger issue concerning corporate accountability in relation to accidents occurring under its watch. Many are calling for reforms across the industry in order to ensure greater public safety when travelling by rail.

"Few politicians were prepared for the upcoming Information Act, which is set to take effect in just over one month. Despite its potential implications on transparency and accountability, very few members of parliament were equipped with the knowledge required to make use of this powerful tool. The lack of readiness among lawmakers highlights a concerning trend; government officials appear to have failed in their duties to adequately inform the political establishment about how they can leverage the new law. As such, citizens remain unaware of their rights to request and access government data as well as records kept by public organizations. 
The report released by the all-parties' committee further identified that thousands more public authorities had yet to implement any form of preparation for the Data Protection Acts (DPA) since 2005. This implies that even when the relevant legislation has been established, there still remains insufficient awareness regarding how it should be enforced or utilized. Moreover, the findings suggest that some local councils have actually gone so far as to deny access to requests made under both DPA and FOIA. When contacted for comment, representatives from the Ministry of Justice could only provide vague assurances of increased guidance being provided to those affected, while failing to acknowledge whether similar efforts had already taken place during the last Parliament. It seems that much work needs to be done before next year's deadline passes without proper consideration being given to ensuring everyone involved understands what their obligations entail.

"Stalemate in Pension Strike Talks
    Talks aimed at averting a potential nationwide dispute between the Government and public service unions over controversial reform proposals related to pensions have come to an end without any accord having been reached. After a lengthy and tense discussion, representatives of five major public sector unions departed from their meeting with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott following the labour conference held in the English city of Gateshead last week, where they had hoped to reach some form of compromise. The main point of contention has been that, despite the many concessions made by the Government on its proposed pension changes, the measures remain highly unpopular among the union members, who feel that the adjustments are unfair. With both sides seemingly unwilling to make further compromises, this is likely to lead to the disruption of essential services as well as possible wildcat strikes across the country if no alternative solutions can be agreed upon. This situation has created a sense of urgency amongst the parties involved, as the deadline for implementation of the regulations looms ever closer. As such, it remains to be seen whether the two sides will be able to find common ground soon, or whether they will continue to pursue a path of increasingly destructive confrontation. It is clear that the future of UK public services hangs in the balance.

"In the upcoming general election campaign, one Liberal Democrat candidate has announced their decision to run against an incumbent Labour Member of Parliament (MP) by standing as a third-party contender. 

George Galloway, a former Speaker of the House of Commons and Labour Co-operative Party member, will be challenging Conservative MP Oona King's seat of Bethnal Green and Bow in East London. This comes after Sir Alan Beith, the leader of the Official Opposition, stated that he supports this move.

The announcement was made during a visit to the constituency office where Mr Galwot had been invited to speak alongside other candidates including the official party candidate Cllr Peter Jones. A large turnout of local residents attended this event held outside a pub called the ""Boat Inn"". Despite not winning any seats previously elected since 1997, it appears likely that there are still many voters willing to support third-party campaigns such as those seen recently within the Scottish National party or UK Independence parties. It also seems likely that some of those currently registered to vote may have simply chosen to abstain instead - which could lead to significant losses when all votes cast are counted later down the line.

The recent events that took place at the United Kingdom's Parliament has sent shockwaves around the world. At least eight protesters, including two teenagers, are now facing criminal charges for unlawfully entering the chambers of parliament and disrupting a session.
The protests came as no surprise; the country has long had an antagonistic relationship between itself and its government. Many citizens feel that their voices are not heard by their elected officials, leading to frequent clashes between protestors and law enforcement officers. This time was no different; when the debating team began discussing the new bill regarding the banning of hunting, things quickly escalated.
Protesters gave voice to their discontentment by shouting slogans and throwing objects at the members of parliament. They also broke through one of the doors and entered the hall where the lawmakers were meeting. The police were immediately called to the scene and managed to arrest seven people, though they released two others due to lack of evidence.
It is clear that this event highlights the increasing divide between the public and the government. The protesters' actions were seen by many as disrespectful and threatening, while some viewed it as a necessary part of exercising their right to freedom of speech. No matter what one's opinion may be, the fact remains that this incident will go down in history as an example of the tensions which exist within our political system.
If the defendants are found guilty of the charges brought against them then they could face up to four years in prison and/or an unlimited fine.

The UK government has expressed its disappointment over the event, but it is up to each individual to decide whether or not such violence is ever justified.

"The political climate was tense as Prime Minister Tony Blair urged European Leaders not to ignore the reality that had been laid bare by U.S. President George W. Bush's victory during last week’s election. In his latest effort to make sure Europe takes action, he held forth against those still in a state of “state of denial” when it came to accepting the consequences of Bush’s re-election. 

Blair spoke out for one simple truth: America had spoken loud and clear this time around. He argued that if other countries wanted any chance of success in dealing with the current issues facing the international community then they needed to acknowledge that the old way of thinking no longer applied. It was now or never - either accept the facts or continue denying them. He stressed that Europe could ill afford another failure like 9/11, which would only serve to worsen relations between nations and lead us down yet more dangerous roads.

He also emphasized that the United States' stance on Iraq was sound; despite what some may have wished to believe there was ample evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This was why the UN Security Council unanimously voted for sanctions against him back in 2000 – but unfortunately none were ever enforced due to opposition within certain member states, particularly Britain and France. 

In addition, Blair pointed to how the US response to the September 11th attacks exposed deep divisions among its allies. Many Europeans felt betrayed after seeing Washington refuse to involve itself in resolving conflicts such as Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, while others thoughtlessly accepted American leadership without question. As such, it seemed obvious that the time for change had come – both in terms of how we approach global security, and our attitude towards America. 

To conclude, Blair concluded by calling upon European leaders to take responsibility for addressing these pressing matters head-on, before they become too difficult to manage. He reminded everyone present that the future of Europe depended entirely on our ability to unite together under common goals and principles, rather than succumbing to fear and prejudice. Only through working collaboratively can we hope to build lasting peace in an increasingly unstable region.

"The crucial decision on whether to approve legislation allowing for super-casinos at the national level, as well as granting planning permission for up to eight such establishments across Britain and including at least one site in Glasgow, will soon face deliberation from representatives within the Scottish Parliament.

Prime Minister Theresa May's administration announced its intentions to implement this policy last week. It intends that each resort must make a minimum investment of £100 million but can surpass it should they prefer. Moreover, the Government also wishes to include London in their plan; consequently giving rise to debates over local jurisdiction and the ability of Westminster to control such projects despite being outside the United Kingdom’s constituent countries. 

In response, the Scottish National Party (SNP), the leading party in the devolved nation since 2007, voiced strong objections against the proposal given that it could result in detrimental consequences for communities near proposed sites. According to figures released during the 2017 election campaign, more than half of Scots voted not only to maintain Scotland’s status within the Union yet also retain full powers when making decisions regarding legal matters like those related to gambling casinos - an issue that was heavily discussed during this period and remains contentious amongst political stakeholders today.

"The Tories attacked the European Union's move on Wednesday to impose stricter regulations on international refugees and migrants. Party leader David Cameron warned that such a decision would undermine Britain’s ability to control its borders, arguing that it could open the door to terrorists and criminals. He called for tougher laws against illegal migration, including larger fines and longer prison sentences for those found guilty of breaching border controls. 

Mr Cameron also argued that the British government should have more influence over Europe-wide policies concerning refugee relocation, citing the recent surge of asylum seekers entering the continent as evidence of the need for greater co-operation between governments. To this end, he proposed an independent commission be set up which would act as a forum for discussing the issue and proposing solutions. It would include representatives from each nation involved, ensuring that the interests of both large and small countries were taken into account. 

The proposal drew mixed reactions from various politicians and advocacy groups. Some saw it as a positive step towards better regulating migration flows, while others criticized it for being too little, too late. In addition, many questioned whether the United Kingdom really had the authority to make decisions about refugee policy within the EU. Despite these concerns, Mr Cameron remains adamant that tougher rules are needed to protect Britain’s citizens and national security. 

So far, the European Union has yet to take a definitive stance on the matter, although officials have indicated they will consider the Conservatives' proposals.

This comes following a highly publicised novel written by former attorney general Lord Goldsmith which makes several accusations against then Prime Minister Tony Blair regarding his choices before invading Iraq. The main accusation put forward in the book is that Gordon Brown, now out of office but still a member of the Cabinet, had instructed Labour MPs to vote in favour of the invasion regardless of what the official legal opinion from the government stated. This would allegedly undermine both the legality of the action taken and the trustworthiness of the British Government itself, potentially leading many to call for a full independent inquiry into the events preceding the conflict.

"Visa Row Mandarin Made Top Civil Servant In Britain's Politics With Knighthood!

	The recent news that a Chinese visitor had their UK visa revoked is creating huge waves throughout the country. It has led to an investigation into why this decision was made, as well as what could have caused it. 

This story began when British home secretary David Blunkett's former lover applied for a work permit in 2008 while on holiday from China. She had previously worked as the nanny of a family close to him but did not apply for permission until after she returned from her trip. When asked by investigators why he granted the woman a job without going through normal procedures, David Blunkett simply said “it would have taken too much time”. This statement has raised many questions among politicians who are now calling for more transparency in government decisions such as these. 

Sir John Grieve, formerly the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Work and Pensions, has recently been awarded knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his role in handling immigration policy. Sir John served as Head of Immigration Services between 2001–2004 before becoming Deputy Government Chief Whip and later Permanent Secretary. He played a key part in formulating the current migration policy framework and managing its implementation. 

During his tenure at the DWP, Sir John faced criticism over some of the departmental decisions surrounding immigration cases involving high profile individuals like David Blunkett. Many argued that there should have been greater oversight and accountability regarding these matters. However, Sir John defended himself saying that all necessary measures had been taken to ensure fairness. 

He added: “It is important to remember that the decision was based on legal grounds and was within my powers to make. I stand by the process we followed and believe that our actions were consistent with the law.” 

While some people may still disagree with certain aspects of Sir John’s decisions, it cannot be denied that he has achieved considerable success since taking up office three years ago. His appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) last year further highlights the positive contributions he has made to society. 

In conclusion, Sir John Grieve’s knighthood serves as recognition of his hard work and dedication towards upholding justice and enforcing the rule of law – qualities essential for any successful leader in today’s world. We can only hope that similar levels of integrity will continue to guide public officials everywhere.",phi2,1
"The lawyer attacked the government's anti-terrorism laws, saying they were giving Britain a bad reputation. This came after Ian McDonald QC, a respected senior barrister and former member of the House of Lords, chose to resign from his position as he felt that detention without trial of terrorism suspect should not be allowed according to the law.

McDonald had been part of an eighteen person panel with privileged access to legal cases involving potential terrorist activities which required secrecy due to the sensitivity of the nature of their work. On Tuesday morning, five more lawyers joined the team following McDonald's resignation. They all shared the same views on the government's policies and believed that it was wrong to detain individuals without any form of judicial oversight or process. 

The move by the five new barristers marks the first time since the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 that there has been a group of senior lawyers openly criticising the government's approaches to counter-terrorism measures. Their stance has also raised questions around whether or not the current legislation allows for enough safeguards against abusing detainees' human rights.

"The Ministry of Education has announced that over 6000 primary, secondary and high school pupils from across England, Wales and Scotland will be participating in a nationwide mock election. 

According to a report published on Wednesday 1st May 2005, students are being encouraged to engage with the electoral process through this series of elections which aims to boost young people’s understanding of politics and democracy. A total of 600 schools have already indicated an interest in getting involved and the initiative is jointly-run by the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills.

The ballot will see students assume the role of either a Labour or Conservative candidate and campaign for votes amongst their peers. To prepare them for election day, pupils are developing speeches, making posters and writing newsletters – tasks which give them a real insight into the world of politics. The goal is to encourage active citizenship and empower young people to make their voices heard. 

The youth vote is seen as a vital component of democratic society. According to a recent survey conducted by the Institute of Social and Economic Research, only one in five voters aged between 18 and 24 turned out in the 2004 US presidential election. This low turnout has been attributed to feelings of apathy and disillusionment among younger generations, who often feel excluded from traditional forms of politics.

To combat this trend, initiatives such as the mock election provide an opportunity for young people to engage with the issues and develop an appreciation for the importance of civic participation. It also offers a chance to educate future citizens on how the political system works and gives them practice in debating key policy issues.

"Tessa Jowell, Minister of State for Culture, Media and Sport had this to say on her announcement that limits are being placed on the number of new casinos being built in the United Kingdom: 

“This is a difficult decision to make, but it has been reached after careful consideration. We have had to weigh up the interests of various stakeholders, including local communities, developers, industry and politicians, and I believe that this policy will help to ensure that any future gambling developments are responsible and sustainable.""

The decision was not taken lightly. The government's original proposal had envisioned up to forty large-scale casinos operating across Britain. This would have been a major increase from the current total of twenty two casinos. The proposed development had been met with widespread opposition from both political parties as well as public health experts who argued that such a high level of expansion could lead to increased addiction rates among vulnerable populations.

To many, the announcement came as a complete surprise, given the strong lobbying efforts put forward by the betting industry over recent years. Many felt that the government had caved into pressure from powerful interest groups instead of standing firm in its commitment to protecting citizens from potential harm associated with gambling.

Despite the backlash, Tessa Jowell maintained that her ministry made the right choice in limiting the growth of casinos throughout Great Britain. She highlighted the importance of taking a cautious approach when considering proposals which may adversely affect society at large. “We must always remember our duty to protect citizens from unnecessary risk,"" she said. “By implementing stricter regulations we can continue to encourage healthy forms of recreation while also keeping irresponsible practices within check.”

With only 24 casinos expected to open nationally, those opposed to the change argue that the impact will still be significant since most areas do not meet the criteria set out by the Government for approval. Furthermore, they note that this reduction does nothing to address existing issues around problem gambling or underage access.

While critics remain unconvinced, one thing remains certain; the British public now awaits with bated breath to see how the Ministry of Culture, Media and Sport handles what promises to be yet another highly controversial issue surrounding gambling regulation in England.

"In today's political climate, one issue on everyone's minds is the potential impact of Tory tax cuts. In an attempt to boost voter morale ahead of the upcoming election, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a plan to reduce taxes by up to 4%. The details behind the proposed tax cuts are yet to be released, but many pundits believe this could represent a significant victory in terms of boosting the Tories' popularity. 

This moves certain Tories back towards their traditional stance of reducing taxes as a way to stimulate economic growth. Such measures were introduced under the previous Conservative government, when Chancellor Nigel Lawson reduced rates of income tax and capital gains tax in 1985. The effects of those policy changes are still felt today, with current Conservatives arguing that lower taxes can help spur business investment and job creation. It remains to be seen whether the current Conservative government will follow through on its promises using similar policies; only time will tell. 

The announcement of the possible tax cuts comes at a crucial point for the Tories. National opinion polls continue to show the Conservative Party trailing behind the Labour Party in both overall support and individual seat numbers. Making such a large-scale promise may be intended to appeal to voters across the ideological spectrum, from conservative liberals to free marketeers. It is also likely to be viewed positively by the UK's small business owners, who remain concerned over the increasing cost of doing business. 

Whether or not these tax cuts will be implemented remains to be seen. Only once Parliament returns from recess later this month can we expect to see further details. If the Conservatives succeed in implementing their plans, it will be interesting to observe the effects on the economy and society as a whole. One thing is for sure, though: this news may go down in history as one of the most significant moments in recent British political history.

In particular, Prime Minister Tony Blair has been met with criticism from opposition Leader Michael Howard - who claims that Labour's promises of increased taxes cannot be trusted. But can we really trust what either candidate says? 

Both parties have been sharpening their knives and haggling over the country's future financial strategy. The current government has already made some changes to try and reduce waste – so why do people still complain when new budgets come around?

"Kenneth Kennedy, a long-time independent politician from Britain's east coast and first member of parliament for East Anglia, has been an integral part of the political landscape since the late 1980s. A self-declared environmentalist and pro-European Union activist, he quickly gained attention within the party when he rose to challenge the status quo and advocate for policy changes that were more progressive than the current establishment. He was successful in building a broad coalition of supporters behind him, and created many positive services and programs in the area. 

The 1988 by-election saw Kennedy become the first MP elected from the new district. He went on to gain enough support over the years to attract attention from other parties, particularly the Conservative Party, whom he challenged continuously until they eventually withdrew their candidacy ahead of the 2001 election.

In May 2005, Kenneth Kennedy stepped down as Member of Parliament after 13 years in office. He had achieved much during his time in government, but his influence seemed to wane at the beginning of this century. Despite his departure, the impact of his work will be felt for decades to come.

    Ed Balls, former chief economic adviser to the Treasury and current member of Parliament for Bootle West, has rejected claims that Chancellor George Osborne will deliver any budget giveaways in the days leading up to Britain's upcoming general election. In an exclusive interview with our team yesterday night at the CBI headquarters here, Ed Balls confirmed this is not the case; citing strong evidence from both sides of the political divide. 
The opposition Conservatives have long been vocal proponents of such a policy shift, arguing it could inject much needed funds into the economy without increasing debt or creating inflationary pressures in the short term - while also providing significant stimulus in terms of job creation and growth potential over time. On Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister David Cameron made similar comments during his press conference outside Number 10 Downing Street when asked whether we should expect a budget surprise tomorrow morning.""

"The UK's Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, has called for greater public transparency around tax policies before the upcoming Pre-Budget Report. Speaking to reporters in Northern Ireland today, Kennedy emphasized that the current taxation levels were appropriate, but that more needed to be done to ensure that the public had access to accurate information.
``People should have faith and confidence in their governments,'' he said. ``Both Labor and Conservative parties need to be upfront and honest about taxes and how they work so that citizens can make informed decisions.''
Kennedy went on to point out that many taxpayers felt unfairly burdened by taxes, especially those in lower income brackets who did not see any benefit from them. This lack of understanding had led to widespread mistrust and frustration among the general population.
To address this problem, the Liberal Democrats have proposed several measures aimed at increasing public awareness of taxation issues. These include setting up an independent watchdog to monitor government spending on taxes, as well as establishing online portals where individuals could easily find information on how their money is being spent.
The move comes amid growing calls for greater accountability from both major political parties. With elections due next year, politicians across all sides are under pressure to show they are listening to voters' concerns over rising living costs and austerity cuts imposed since 2010. 
While there remains little clarity yet over what specific changes will occur in terms of taxes after the Budget announcement tomorrow, it appears clear that some form of reform is inevitable if the government wishes to restore trust between itself and its constituents. It seems likely that we may even see new initiatives launched which target different types of taxes depending on individual circumstances such as wealth or employment status.",phi2,1

Mrs Jones argued that there were plenty of less intrusive measures that ought to be taken instead, such as increased mental health support and better integration between law enforcement and communities.
 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister's Office (PMO) spokesman Richard Brown refused to vouch for the proposals. He insisted that the decision had been made after careful consideration of all possible implications and that the Government was committed to protecting citizens from terrorism.

He voiced particular apprehension relating to potential increases in violent incidents arising out of drunkenness during extended hours.
 
Nevertheless, Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell maintained her support for extending opening hours while asserting “the safety of all citizens remains our number one priority”. She also indicated that any measures taken must take into account the views of both sides before being implemented accordingly. In response to the Conservatives' criticisms, Ms.Jowell stated she is willing to engage in discussions regarding how best to address their points raised and ensure that the wellbeing of members of society does not become compromised.

"News Article Title: UK Heading Wrong Way as Howard Blunders His Chance To Tackle Issues Facing The Nation 
    Subtitle: Michael Howard, the Conservatives' Leader Has Criticised The Government For Being A Bossy And Interfering Body That Takes Decisions That Should Be Made By Individuals.
``Britain is headed in the wrong direction,"" the Conservatives' Leader Michael Howard stated today while issuing an official statement following Prime Minister's failure to take action on some of the country’s most pressing issues. Speaking out after the end-of-year festivities, he accused Prime Minister Tony Blair’s administration for being “bureaucratically inclined"", which resulted in it making poor judgement calls that are not always beneficial to citizens. 

In particular, he pointed to the NHS and immigration policies as areas where Blair’s team have fallen short over the past few years. Despite promises from all major political parties during their campaigns prior to last year’s election, many critics believe that both the current Labour government and previous Coalition partners like the Liberal Democrats did little more than talk without taking any substantial steps forward when they were elected into office. This lack of progress led to widespread discontent among voters who wanted real solutions rather than platitudes delivered through sound bites or press releases.""The Tories [i.e.,the Conservatives] will deliver on our manifesto commitments if we win power next May 6th,"" said Mr Howard adding that the party plans t o invest heavily in social programs such education reform whilst also reducing bureaucracy within local councils so those communities can make better decisions for themselves.""This approach will put us back in touch with ordinary British people, giving them control over what happens locally instead of letting politicians dictate policy from London,"" continued Mr Howard arguing that this would help ensure fair representation across the nation.""We need to move away from top down approaches that simply impose changes upon citizens without consulting those directly affected.""""Labour must understand that there is no single solution fit all when addressing complex national challenges; every region and community faces its own unique circumstances and requires tailored responses accordingly""""Our goal isn't merely passing legislation but ensuring everyone benefits from meaningful improvements in quality of life at home whether economically disadvantaged families struggling day to pay bills due to high unemployment rates caused by austerity measures introduced under the previous government or senior citizens living independently yet feeling isolated due too much red tape preventing easy access to public services provided by health authorities etc.,"" concluded Mr Howard calling for increased cooperation between different levels of governance nationwide including greater devolution powers given over decision-making authority from Westminster down towards regional administrations.""Only then will Britons truly regain confidence in how best represent their interests in parliament and ultimately secure lasting change throughout society"".

"The EU referendum campaign has been met with stiff opposition from politicians and the public alike. Many argue that it will be too costly, with the potential to reach up to £80 million, almost double the amount spent in a recent general election. However, others feel that the decision of whether or not to remain part of the European Union is a deeply personal one and should not be forced upon the nation by taxpayers.

The referendum has sparked wide debate across the country, with many arguing over the pros and cons of remaining in the European union. Opponents of the referendum argue that staying in the EU may lead to the loss of sovereignty, while supporters insist that remaining in the EU brings great benefits such as free trade, peace and security, and economic stability. 

Prime Minister David Cameron has urged the nation to vote to remain in the EU, stressing the importance of being part of an international community. Meanwhile, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has warned that leaving the EU could seriously harm the environment, pointing to the EU's regulations on carbon emissions, water quality, and wildlife protection. 

To make sure that the voting process is fair and secure, the government has hired thousands of extra police officers to oversee the referendum. This has led to concerns from some critics who believe that the high number of troops is an unnecessary expense. 

Despite this, the referendum remains scheduled to take place next month. The outcome is expected to be highly contested and the political consequences of the result are yet to be seen. One thing is for certain though: the Brexit issue has become a major topic during the past few months, and it is likely to continue to be a prominent feature in the coming years.

"In a recent decision, it was announced that all four British men detained at Guantanamo Bay would be released back into the United Kingdom. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, declared that this release could occur within the next few days or possibly even sooner if necessary.
 
The four detainees—Moazzam Begg, an Islamic charity worker born in Birmingham; Martin Mubanga, also known as Abdul Mutallab, a Nigerian who allegedly attempted to detonate explosives aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253; former soldier Richard Belmar; and alleged al-Qaeda courier Feroz Khan Abbasi—had each spent nearly three years imprisoned at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp located in Cuba. Their prolonged detainment has long been controversial, raising questions concerning the legalities behind their imprisonment, given that most other prisoners had no connection to terrorism before being arrested in Pakistan in December 2001. Despite appeals made through various channels such as petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of citizens across Britain as well as multiple hearings organized by local MPs and human rights groups, the US government’s stance remained steadfast until now.
 
This latest announcement comes after months of negotiations between the two countries aimed at resolving the issue once and for all. In late 2008 the Bush administration initiated talks with senior officials of the Obama administration regarding plans for repatriating some of those still left stranded abroad. Since then, there have been occasional reports suggesting progress is nearing fruition, but none more significant than today's declaration which officially confirms what many suspected – that a resolution can soon be achieved without compromising national security interests. It remains unclear however exactly how much time might pass prior to actual implementation given the intricacies associated with releasing individuals accused or convicted under wartime regulations (such as Article 37) while ensuring safety measures are met due to potential threats posed by certain inmates who may pose risks either during transport home or upon arrival at destination locations.

"The government's plans to cut up to 71,000 public-sector jobs has been met with criticism from the Trade Union Congress (TUC). The TUC is warning that such drastic measures could result in reducing quality in the delivery of public services. They say that it would also likely harm social cohesion as many people rely on the public sector for their livelihoods. 

The potential implications of such job losses are significant. To begin with, there will be a major loss of skills in the workforce. This will create a shortage of trained employees which will ultimately lead to fewer opportunities available for those who are still employed. In addition, there will be less competition in the labor market leading to an increase in wages and fewer benefits. This will make it harder for employers to attract talent and may cause a further decline in the quality of life for workers. 

From a political perspective, this can be seen as a sign of weakness by the government. It indicates that they are unable to find alternative solutions to cutting costs and are instead turning to harsh measures that will affect real people. Furthermore, it shows that they are not taking into account the long-term consequences of their decisions or considering the impact that them making might have on society.

If these job cuts go ahead, it is unlikely that the desired cost savings will be achieved. This is because when jobs are lost, this leads to a decrease in economic activity as individuals lose their income and spending power. This, in turn, causes businesses to suffer and can lead to more job losses. Therefore, the government’s efforts to reduce deficits through austerity measures may actually end up increasing them in the long run.

In conclusion, the Government’s decision to make so many job cuts across the public sector is a dangerous one. Not only does it serve to weaken the economy, but it also shows a disregard for the well-being of citizens. By implementing such policies, the government must consider the short-term and long-term effects of its actions and explore other avenues should unemployment continue to rise.

  The five major UK political parties have come together, aiming to prevent a potential nationwide crisis as negotiations begin regarding controversial new legislation surrounding state-sponsored pensions. The proposed changes include an increase to the retirement age for some civil servants and other key personnel employed by local authorities across the country – sparking widespread unrest among trade union members who fear their hard-earned savings could soon run dry earlier than expected.

  In order to avoid such an outcome, representatives from all sides are set to convene in London later today to engage in discussions intended at finding common ground amidst deep divisions on both how much money should go towards providing secure retirements, and whether it is reasonable to expect employees already close to or nearing official retirement ages to continue working under more rigorous conditions. 

John Prescott, Deputy Prime Minister, has been tasked with moderating these talks; his primary goal being to facilitate productive dialogue between opposing factions so they can reach agreements that benefit everybody involved without compromising either side’s core beliefs. In recent days, there have been fears expressed amongst those attending preparatory meetings ahead of what promises to be yet another long session involving heated debate over various contentious topics like taxation rates levied against wealthier individuals earning salaries above £150,000 per annum and possible increases imposed upon fuel prices if certain budgetary demands are not met within specified time frames.

"The Liberal Democrats (LDs) have issued a press release announcing that they expect to achieve their highest-ever level of support at this year's general election. This comes after an internal survey found that strength among LD members increased from 83% to 86%. It is clear that the Liberals Democrats are confident of gaining more votes than ever before. 

The party's leadership, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, have been active in campaigning for the upcoming election. They have focused on reducing debt, public spending, and welfare costs, while also promoting freedom of speech and religious tolerance. Their opponents – the Conservative Party under John Smith – are focusing on maintaining current policies, such as higher taxes, more government regulation, and stronger social safety nets. 

With the issues at hand, it is no surprise that the Liberals Democrats are predicting their best electoral performance yet. Ahead of the polls, surveys suggest that the Conservatives are likely to lose several seats in the House of Commons and the Labour Party could suffer a significant decrease in voters. This could lead to a net gain of around 80 Liberal Democrat MPs in the general election. 

The Lib Dem manifesto includes many ambitious proposals, including replacing council tax with a local income tax, investing in renewable energy sources, and introducing a new national health service. These measures aim to create greater equality across Britain, reduce poverty rates, and improve the quality of life for all citizens. In addition to these political reforms, the party is emphasizing the importance of education, science, and technology research, which will help drive innovation and economic growth. 

The Liberal Democrats hope to capitalize on the growing dissatisfaction with the current administration's handling of various policy matters, such as immigration, security, and international relations. By making a strong case for reform, the party aims to demonstrate to voters why they should elect them over other parties. With the right strategy and messaging, the LDs believe they can make a substantial difference in the coming months. 

As the election approaches, it will be interesting to see how successful the Liberal Democrats are in achieving their goals. If they manage to win enough seats in parliament, they may well become the third largest political force in Britain, allowing them to influence policy and shape the future of the country.

"The recent attack on UK Independence Party (UKIP) Member of Parliament, Robert Kilroy-Silk, highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding European integration and nationalism. On Monday evening, while returning to his studio following a BBC Radio 5 Live broadcast, Kilroy-Silk found himself targeted by an unidentified assailant as they hurled a bucket filled with farm slurry at their backside. 

In addition to Kilroy-Silk being drenched in slurry, fellow UKIP colleague Ruth Kelly MP, who accompanied him that night, too fell victim to this bizarre assault, adding insult to injury. Both politicians were left visibly shaken as they attempted to regain composure amidst the chaos. While the attacker's motive remains unclear, one thing is certain - such acts are nothing new in today's political climate.

For years now, nationalist sentiments have been on the rise across Europe, leading to increased polarization among citizens and lawmakers alike. Many argue that EU membership has eroded national identity and autonomy, sparking protests like the one targeting Kilroy-Silk earlier that day. In fact, similar incidents occurred recently in multiple countries throughout the bloc; however, this incident took place specifically within the United Kingdom, further fueling concerns regarding British Euroscepticism.

While some claim this attack may be seen as a direct response to UKIP’s anti-EU stance, critics point out that it merely reflects the growing frustration felt by many towards perceived injustices within the Union. They suggest that this violence represents more than just anger or aggression but rather serves as a cry against what individuals view as excessive regulation, loss of sovereignty, and economic burdens imposed upon them by Brussels.

Nevertheless, both Kilroy-Silk and Kelly remain committed to engaging in open dialogue about Britain’s future relationship with the EU, despite the increasingly hostile environment surrounding them. As part of their efforts, they plan to use this unfortunate event as an opportunity to address the frustrations expressed by protesters without resorting to personal attacks themselves.

It is crucial to recognize the significance of maintaining respectful discourse even during times of disagreement. By focusing on constructive conversations, we can strive toward finding common ground, fostering understanding, and ultimately working together to build a better future. It is through peaceful means that lasting solutions will emerge and enable us all to overcome our differences.

The town is home to more than three million people who reside in poorly constructed dwellings, lack access to basic services such as clean water and healthcare, and suffer from high levels of crime and violence. This visit comes at a time when President Obama is scheduled to arrive in Kenya later this month for two days of official tourism.

  During his tour, Prime Minister Brown met with local officials, non-governmental organizations, and community leaders to discuss initiatives aimed at improving living conditions in the area. These include providing better infrastructure for education and health care, increasing economic opportunities through job training programs, and promoting entrepreneurship among young people. In addition, they also discussed efforts to combat corruption within government institutions and provide greater transparency around public spending. 

  Mr. Brown highlighted the importance of international cooperation and solidarity in tackling global challenges such as poverty, disease, and climate change. His comments were echoed by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her recent visit to Ethiopia, where she emphasized the need for increased investment and support for African countries facing significant social and economic hardships. Together with President Bush’s administration, the United Kingdom has been actively working towards strengthening ties between Britain and its African partners, particularly those most affected by instability and conflict. As Chairman of the G8 this year, it was hoped that this focus would be extended further still.

"The Liberal Democrats have called for a fresh investigation into the claims made against former Home Secretary David Blunkett. The party's leader, Nick Clegg, has demanded that Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Justice Secretary Jack Straw set out in writing their plans on how they intend to respond to allegations made by Conservative MP Philip Davies last week. 

Davies accused Blunkett of using his position to help speed up the visa application process for a woman who was seeking entry into the United Kingdom while he himself held office. The Liberal Democrats argue that this is an important question which must be answered before any further action can take place. They also suggest that an independent inquiry should examine other potential cases where Blunkett may have abused his power.

Sir Alan Budd, the head of the previous government’s inquiry into police corruption, conducted an extensive examination into Blunkett’s conduct during his time in public service. While his report found evidence of misconduct on the part of several senior officers within the force, it did not directly link Blunkett personally to any wrongdoing. In particular, it failed to answer some key questions surrounding Blunkett’s treatment of Mrs. Nairn, the nanny employed at one point when she lived at 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the British prime minister.

"The United Kingdom has been accused once again of discriminating against minority groups. This time, civil rights organization Liberty is calling attention to the country's discriminatory immigration policies that specifically target Roma communities in their pursuit to reduce asylum seekers. 
In a ruling recently handed down by the House of Lords, it was determined that the British government had intentionally and unlawfully denied access to certain individuals solely because of their racial or ethnic background – something which could potentially amount to illegal persecution. The case revolved around refugees who wished to enter the UK but were prevented from doing so on grounds related to race or ethnicity. It appears that this decision reflects a wider pattern within the nation’s current approach to migration and immigration matters. 

According to Liberty lawyer Pauline Bastien, the outcome highlights just how far removed from basic human rights some members of society still remain. “This kind of discrimination doesn't just affect those directly targeted; it sends out an alarm bell throughout our entire society that someone can be excluded simply due to where they're originally from,"" she argued.
It seems that recent events may serve as further evidence of the deep-rooted issues facing both immigrants and minorities living under British rule today. In June 2019, for instance, the government passed controversial new laws making it harder for many people fleeing conflict zones such as Iraq or Syria to gain refugee status. At the same time, reports indicated that the majority of those arriving at the borders between Calais and France were either Romani or Afghan migrants attempting to make their way west across the Channel. Despite repeated calls for greater understanding and acceptance of different cultures and beliefs, the reality remains that such disparities continue to persist along lines of national origin even though there are countless stories of successful integration found all over Europe. 
Of course, no single issue stands alone when considering the plight of those trying to find safety away from home through legal means - poverty, political instability, religious intolerance...all play important roles in shaping the lives of millions worldwide regardless of geography or nationality. Nonetheless, we should never forget how intertwined these problems often seem to become when faced head on with prejudice rooted somewhere else entirely like racism itself. As long as systems exist allowing us to judge one another based largely upon skin color rather than character then nothing will change until those structures come undone too – unless enough brave souls decide to fight back before its already too late!

"News Article: Turkey Deal To Help World Peace
The deal bringing Turkey one step closer to joining the European Union (EU) was seen as being of “fundamental importance” by Tony Blair. 
Mr Blair, when speaking after it had been announced, described the agreement as representing an important achievement for Britain. He suggested that this could go some way in aiding global stability.

In his comments, he went on to say the success of the Turkish deal would prove those who make the claim there exists conflict between different faiths were incorrect. In other words, he argued the treaty should be viewed positively as something which will bring together people from all backgrounds - including both Muslims and Christians alike. This point was echoed by many others present during the announcement ceremony.

It remains to be seen what effect, if any, this new partnership will have on international relations, particularly given recent tensions around the Middle East. However, there are already signs it may lead towards increased understanding among nations in terms of culture and religion - although only time will tell how successful such efforts will ultimately prove to be.",phi2,1

He added that the primary objective ought to shift from solely attempting to eradicate any form of terror threat towards ensuring that there is no possibility of them resulting in catastrophic nuclear warfare.

"The Cabinet was filled with rage and frustration as they heard news of the latest attempt by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The cabinet members were angered when it came to light that money intended for vital government services would be diverted towards keeping local taxes low. 
Local Government Secretary, Nick Raynsford tried to defend the move, claiming that it was necessary if councils wanted better value for their citizens. He argued that the funds should go toward providing more public services or reducing crime rates. However, many members of the Cabinet disagreed. They pointed out that this decision would only benefit certain areas while leaving others worse off. It also meant less funding for important initiatives such as health care and education.
The announcement caused an uproar among MPs who quickly began voicing their displeasure with Mr.Brown's policy. One MP called him a “careless politician” and accused him of playing favourites with some constituencies. Another criticised Mr.Brown for not taking into account the long term implications of his decisions. These sentiments were echoed by many other politicians across the country, who feared that this could lead to further inequality between regions.
Meanwhile, councillors in affected areas have expressed outrage too. Many feel betrayed by what they see as an unjust redistribution of resources. Some even went so far as to say that they will refuse any help offered until this situation is rectified. This sentiment is shared by many people in those communities where cuts have already been made due to reduced funding.

"In recent years, the United Kingdom’s two main political parties have been in a bitter conflict filled with tense debates and public scrutiny. This long-standing rivalry began after the 1997 election when Prime Minister Tony Blair declared his intention to form a new coalition government following the Conservative victory. The Conservatives had lost their majority and relied on support from other parties such as the Liberal Democrats, National Liberals, Ulster Unionists, and Scottish Nationals in order to stay in power.

This coalition led by Labour was heavily criticized for its lack of clarity on several issues during its first few months in office. In an effort to restore faith among voters, former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote an open letter calling on Tony Blair to resign before the next General Election. He argued that it had taken far too much time since the 1997 election to make any progress towards important reforms, including devolution of powers or reform of the House of Lords, both of which were promised by the party when they entered into office five years ago. 

Despite this call for action, many still held out hope that change could come within the remaining year until the 2005 General Elections. However, even then, doubts remained regarding whether any significant changes would actually take place. Furthermore, there was speculation concerning what might happen if Tony Blair did not succeed in securing another term in office, with some suggesting that Gordon Brown may become leader instead.

"The issue of political prisoners remains an ongoing challenge across the globe, as seen from the recent calls to liberate the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay and other countries such as the United Kingdom. To this end, South Africa's most renowned religious leader, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has spoken out against detention without trial, calling it a ""detrimental and disturbing practice"". He went on to say that no one should ever have to endure such oppression and injustice, especially those who are innocent. 

Recently, news broke that the United States has announced their decision to free four British citizens who had been previously held captive at Guantanamo Bay. This news was met with relief and joy by families and friends of the captives, who had been waiting for years for their loved ones' return. The US government stated that the freeing of the British citizens was part of a broader effort to combat terrorism around the world, and is a step towards creating a safer global community. 

At the same time, many human rights groups continued to press for the immediate release of all political prisoners everywhere. It is argued that holding people without trial for extended periods of time can lead to serious abuses and violations of basic human rights. For this reason, many governments are under pressure to ensure that justice is served and that those accused of crimes receive fair trials. 

Since the opening of Guantánamo Bay in 2002, over 400 individuals have been held there despite never having been charged with a crime. Many of these individuals remain imprisoned today, making up what is widely regarded as the largest concentration of politically motivated prisoners in the world. The situation has drawn widespread criticism from human rights organizations and politicians alike, leading some to call for its closure and the immediate liberation of all detainees. 

Despite this continued push for reform, the fight for the freedom of political prisoners shows no signs of slowing down. With more and more people becoming aware of the injustices faced by those in custody, there is growing momentum behind efforts to create lasting change.

"In today's political news, we mourned the passing of ex-Prime Minister Lord Callaghan. At the age of 92, he sadly left us on the evening before his 93th birthday, leaving behind a legacy that will forever be remembered by many. His sudden demise comes shortly after his beloved wife Audrey passed away at the age of 91. 
Callahan’s time as Prime Minister spanned from 1974 to 1979 under the leadership of Queen Elizabeth II. During this period, he worked tirelessly for the betterment of the nation, leading it through various economic challenges and international conflicts. As one of Britain”s most iconic politicians, he is best known for having served twice as Leader of the Opposition – firstly when Edward Heath resigned following a landslide election defeat in 1970, and then again in 1975 following Margaret Thatcher “taking power.” Throughout his tenure, he fought hard against both domestic and foreign policy issues alike – all while maintaining an unwavering commitment to public service and democratic ideals. 
The announcement came as quite a shock given how recently Callaghan announced his decision not run for re-election ahead of the next general election due to health reasons. However, despite his declining physical condition since entering office more than four decades ago; there remains no doubt that such qualities continue to live within him even until his last breath. Such grace & honourable behaviour serves as an inspiration for people across the country as they look towards their own futures - whatever those may bring! 
We express our heartfelt condolences upon Lord Callaghan”s family members & friends during this difficult time, whilst also celebrating every aspect of his remarkable life which shaped modern Britain into what it is today; namely its strong sense (and dedication) when tackling major obstacles head-on – along side much needed understanding between different sides/groups too..",phi2,1
"- Labour has been heavily criticized for their lack of transparency and dishonesty in promoting the European Union (EU).

They claim that the government's recent release of a white paper detailing its plans for the future relationship between Britain and Europe, including membership in various institutions such as NATO and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, is nothing more than an attempt to mislead the voters before the upcoming referendum on the proposed EU Constitution.

"In recent times, calls have grown louder in British political circles to increase the proportion of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) representatives elected into Parliament. However, such an initiative was met with immediate resistance when a prominent figure within the Labour Party, Shahid Malik, spoke out against what he called “all-black” parliamentary candidate lists being introduced before upcoming elections. 

	Mr. Malik's statement came at the same time as other influential members of the party were pushing for a greater emphasis on increasing diversity within the ranks of their politicians. But Mr. Malik disagreed strongly; he argued that setting numerical goals would only lead to tokenism, rather than real progress towards true inclusion. He suggested instead that efforts ought to focus on supporting more diverse candidates running independently, without any specific quotas or reservations. This stance drew criticism from some quarters, particularly those feeling let down by the lack of visible advancement they felt had occurred over recent years despite ongoing initiatives meant to foster racial equality in politics. 

	Despite this opposition, it appears likely that measures aimed at boosting BME recruitment will continue to feature prominently among many parties' manifestos ahead of next year's general election. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Malik will ultimately prove correct in his assertion that targeting numbers alone cannot bring meaningful change if we do not also address systemic issues around access and opportunity. Only then can Britain truly begin making strides towards achieving equal representation across its various communities.

"The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, has today [date] announced an end to petrol duty rises and will keep fuel costs stable for the next two years, it was confirmed. The move comes as part of wider price controls being implemented by this Government to help ease pressure on household finances. Fuel prices have been rising steadily over recent months due to increases in global demand and supply issues. However, the rise has not kept up with the rate of inflation leading to higher living expenses for many citizens. This new announcement is expected to provide some relief to motorists across Britain who have seen their budgets stretched further than ever before. In addition, other measures such as tax cuts and additional support for low-income families are also planned which could make a significant difference. This decision follows earlier announcements from Prime Minister Tony Blair last week where he called on Parliament to find ways of reducing taxes and helping people cope with high costs of living. It is hoped that by freezing fuel duty and introducing more generous welfare benefits those affected most by rising prices will benefit substantially.",phi2,1
"In recent years, the Labour Party has become increasingly divided along ideological lines. This division has come into sharp focus in the past few months as tensions have risen within its ranks following the publication of two books which have sparked controversy among members. 
The first book, ""This House Sees Red,"" written by long-standing Labour Member of Parliament (MP) John Smith, argues for increased socialist influence in British policy-making. It has been met with strong resistance from those on the conservative side of the spectrum who view such policies as a threat to Britain's traditional values. 
The second book, ""Politics made Simple"", co-written by former Conservative MP Richard Johnson and journalist Chris Giles, takes a more moderate stance but still contains elements of criticism towards the current state of British politics. Its main argument is that the political system is too focused on short-term goals rather than working towards meaningful change. 
These two publications have caused a great deal of unease amongst Labour Members of Parliament. Many are concerned that if they do not take action soon, they may face serious consequences in the upcoming general election. 
One such member is Margaret Wilson, a Labour peer who sits on the Parliamentary Labour Party committee tasked with selecting candidates for the next election. She believes that unless the divisions within the Party can be resolved quickly, then it could lead to chaos and ultimately cost them the election. Her concerns were echoed by many other MPs when she presented her case before the committee last week. 
Despite this, some Labour MPs argue that the real issue lies elsewhere – not with internal disagreements, but rather with external forces attempting to undermine the Party. They point to what they see as an orchestrated campaign against Labour spearheaded by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and his allies in the right wing media. According to this narrative, the aim is to create doubt and uncertainty amongst voters so as to damage Labour's chances of winning.
Whatever the cause of the divide, one thing is clear: something must be done to ensure that the Labour Party remains united and presents itself as a viable alternative to the ruling Conservatives. Otherwise, all hope of defeating the Tories in 2020 will be lost.

	Fox stated that if one is willing to commit such acts as lying and manipulating public opinion during wartime then they have no business participating in the democratic process or holding high office again in government."" This statement sparked immediate backlash from supporters of the Labour Party who believe it is unfair to single out Tony Blair while ignoring other past politicians who may also be guilty of similar actions. However, Fox stood by his comments stating “It’s not enough just to point fingers; we need to take action towards ensuring that our democracy remains honest and open”.

"In recent days, there has been increasing debate in political circles regarding whether or not identity cards should be introduced. Conservative politicians have long been divided on this issue, although recently their stance appears to have taken a more firm position towards them being issued as soon as possible. 

The Conservatives now plan to back the proposed legislation that would make it mandatory for all citizens to possess an identification card. This measure was initially put forward by the British Government but was heavily opposed by many members of both major parties and the public at large. Despite this opposition, Prime Minister Tony Blair has pushed forward with his plans, arguing that identity cards are necessary to increase national security. 

However, many within the Conservative Party are still skeptical of the benefits of such a policy and argue that the increased state surveillance that it would bring could lead to civil liberties being eroded. There is also concern that it may disproportionately affect certain ethnic groups and create a two-tiered society where those without access to the technology needed to obtain an identifier would be excluded from basic services. 

Despite these reservations, the Shadow Cabinet has announced that they will be supporting the government's proposal. They argue that, while there are valid concerns over privacy issues, the potential benefits of having an improved system for verifying one's identity outweigh any potential detriment. Furthermore, they believe that introducing a form of identity verification is essential if Britain is to remain secure in an increasingly complex world.

Given the strong stance taken by the Shadow Cabinet, it seems likely that the bill will pass through parliament relatively quickly. It remains to be seen how successful the new system will prove in practice, however, and only time will tell whether or not identity cards become a reality in the UK.

"The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee will hold an inquiry into whether or not political parties are using illegal means during their campaigns. Specifically, it will investigate allegations that Labour has been making unsolicited phone calls to households registered as having opted out of receiving such calls. These so-called “cold calls” represent what many believe to be a breach in privacy rights. 


It comes after reports that the Liberal Democrats (LDs) received complaints about Labour's use of its call centers, which allegedly called those who had signed up for marketing notifications without first obtaining consent. In response to this criticism, the LDs have lodged formal requests under Britain’s Freedom of Information Act seeking details around how Labour plans to ensure compliance with regulations concerning unsolicited calls. 

A spokesperson for Labour told PoliticsHome that while it was true some individuals may have felt uncomfortable with the number of calls made by Labour’s staff members, no evidence had yet been presented suggesting any wrongdoing had occurred. They went onto state that all decisions regarding contact lists were taken following proper guidelines laid down by the Electoral Commission - the body responsible for regulating elections in the UK – and that measures had already been put in place to protect against further breaches of privacy laws. 

Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday welcomed moves towards greater transparency within our democracy, stating his own party would also take steps to improve standards among campaigners throughout the upcoming general election season. Mr Cameron added he hoped more could now be done to address issues raised by both major parties when discussing how best to prevent similar problems arising again in future electoral cycles. 

This latest investigation follows previous scrutiny surrounding other aspects of each camp’s approach during this year’s contestations; including alleged manipulation through social media posts designed to influence voter sentiment before polling day takes place across various constituencies nationwide. Despite numerous assurances given by both sides throughout recent months assuring constituents their activities met legal requirements set by relevant authorities, there remains scepticism amongst certain quarters who feel uneasy at being subjected to unwanted messages regardless if they opt-in or otherwise agree upon them beforehand. It therefore seems timely once again for lawmakers across Westminster to review existing legislation pertaining specifically to campaigning activity conducted prior to voting days taking place ahead next Thursday 8 June 2020.""

"News Article Title : Scottish Politicians Move To Protect Workers' Holidays.

    The drive to protect workers’ holiday entitlements during this year’s “festive season of goodwill” has been met with support from local politicians, who have begun calling for legislation to keep retail businesses close on Christmas Day and New Year's Day in Scotland. 

Karen Whitefield, an independent member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has taken the lead on this issue, arguing that employees should be allowed some time away from work so they can spend quality time with family over the holidays. She plans to introduce a bill to guarantee that large companies do not open on either day, thereby protecting workers' rights while also allowing them to take part in traditional festivities associated with those dates.

Whitefield believes that such a law will provide much needed protection against long working hours as well as providing more security for workers when it comes to scheduling their annual leave around important events like Christmas. It would also prevent employers taking advantage of staff by forcing them to work longer shifts than normal without additional pay or benefits. 

This move follows similar efforts at both national and international levels where governments and labour unions alike have come together in order to secure better protections for employees across various sectors. In particular, there has been growing interest among many countries regarding workplace safety standards given recent economic pressures caused by Covid-19 restrictions – including increased stressors related to job losses, reduced income and heightened health risks due to lack of access to healthcare services.

"In recent days, political figures have been discussing and debating the issues facing England. From taxes to health care and from education, every topic seems to be on the agenda of some Prime Minister or other. But one issue stands out among others - immigration. Immigration has become an increasingly contentious issue in England since the country's entrance into the European Union.

When Elizabeth Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 2005, immigration was not immediately on her radar. Her primary focus was on reducing public spending, cutting welfare programs, and increasing defense and security. It wasn't until 2007 that she adopted a more pro-immigration stance during her re-election bid. Even then, it focused primarily on regulating migration rather than promoting it.

But over the last few years, the debate around immigration has grown exponentially. With the 2008 recession, many argued that immigrants were taking jobs away from Britons. And with the rise of far-right groups, such as Britain First, the sentiment towards immigrants has only hardened.

Since 2010, Queen’s Park has been working hard to address this complex issue. They implemented tougher laws on illegal immigration, increased border control measures, and strengthened visa requirements for those coming from outside the EU. They‘ve also sought to reduce net migration by introducing the “Points Based System” (PBS), which prioritizes skilled workers. This system requires potential migrants to meet certain criteria before they are accepted for entry.

Despite these efforts, however, immigration remains a divisive and complicated subject in British society today. While much attention is paid to its economic impacts, less is said about the social implications of immigration. What do immigrant communities bring to our culture? How does immigration shape our identity as a nation? These are questions that remain unanswered despite how long the discussion has gone on.

"Lord Chancellor defends mental capacity reform 
By Jane Smith 
The government has come under fire for its handling of the Mental Capacity Act, with some suggesting that reforms could open the door to euthanasia. However, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Falconer has defended the legislation, saying that changes to make the process more efficient and accessible were long overdue. 

Lord Falconer addressed concerns around the potential for abuse by stating “It is unfair to criticize the late-night adjustments made to the bill”. He went on to say that those objections were unfounded as they were merely attempts to create chaos during an already tumultuous period. 

In recent days, there had been intense debate over the proposed reforms, with many MPs feeling that the issues at hand needed greater attention before any action was taken. The Conservatives particularly criticised the rushed nature of the alterations, claiming they showed how little consideration the Government had given to their implications. 

Despite this criticism, Lord Falconer remained adamant that the modifications were necessary if the act was going to remain effective. He argued that while no one wanted to see the vulnerable become victims of exploitation or coercion, sometimes difficult decisions need to be taken in order to ensure justice is done. 

The comments from the Lord Chancellor come hot on the heels of reports that the Government was considering introducing new safeguards against possible abuses of power when it comes to end-of-life care. These measures include extra oversight and increased transparency so that families can feel assured that all aspects of the decision making process are being properly considered. 

While it remains to be seen whether or not the reforms will ultimately pass into law, it seems clear that the Government wants to do whatever it takes to protect people's rights when it comes to healthcare decisions. With the issue currently dominating headlines, it will be interesting to watch how events unfold next week and beyond.

"In response, Michael Howard hit back at what was described as a “mongrel jab” from fellow politician Peter Hain. The Tory Leader accused him of behaving like a mere ""attack mongrel"", suggesting that Labour had been shaken up and discombobulated by their own campaign strategy. 

Mr Hain's comments came during the Conservative Party's annual convention - but it remains unclear if this will impact on the ongoing debate around terrorism legislation currently being considered through Parliament. Despite the controversy surrounding the issue, Prime Minister Gordon Brown remained adamant ahead of last week's vote which saw a narrow majority for the Bill in both chambers. It is now likely to return to the House of Commons later this year for its third reading. This means that despite the divisive nature of the proposed measures there is still some hope that the current government can reach agreement on how best to combat terror. Nevertheless, such tensions have certainly not gone unnoticed within the political arena, with many observers highlighting the difficulty facing those tasked with devising a viable solution to a problem so complex and contentious. As ever, the future of UK security appears increasingly uncertain – although one thing is certain: neither the Conservatives nor Labour are willing to budge when it comes to protecting the nation's citizens.

"The Royal couple is facing criticism for their upcoming wedding. Despite being supported by many citizens and two thirds believing that it should be allowed in Britain, forty percent are opposed to the royal's marriage. This rate has grown from fifteen percent when Prime Minister David Cameron initially announced their intention to tie the knot. The announcement was made amidst a number of contentious issues such as global wars and economic instability. As a result, many believe this wedding serves as a distraction from more important matters. Moreover, some argue that the monarchy should not exist and its wealth should be redistributed to help those less fortunate. It remains to be seen whether or not the monarchy will continue to have a place in England in the21st century. 

As the wedding approaches, opinions among the British public remain divided. Many see the union between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer as long overdue, while others feel that it reinforces outdated social expectations of women. Additionally, some worry that the marriage will further fuel class divisions in England, with the Royals setting an example that few can follow. Furthermore, the current political climate means that many assume that the marriage will not occur without controversy. With the economy deteriorating and the cost of living continuing to rise, many fear that this wedding is irresponsible and unnecessary. 

Despite the opposition to the marriage, Prince Charles and Lady Diana's love story continues to captivate the attention of the world. They met when Charles was working as an aide to Diana's father, Lord Snowdon, and soon began dating. Their relationship progressed quickly, and soon the press caught wind and the two were soon engaged. While their engagement was short-lived—Lord Snowdon died just days before their wedding—their romance remained strong. 

The wedding itself is set to be a grand affair, with guests expected to dress up in formal attire. However, due to the ongoing pandemic, all attendees must wear masks and practice social distancing measures. In addition, the venue has been changed from Westminster Abbey to Windsor Castle in order to accommodate larger crowds. 

With so much uncertainty surrounding the impending nuptials, one thing is certain: Prince Charles and Lady Diana's wedding will go down in history as one of the most iconic weddings in recent times. Whether you support the monarchy or not, there is no denying the couple's love story and their commitment to each other. We can expect the wedding to be a celebration of love and hope for the future, regardless of the controversies it may bring.

"- In a speech defending new legislation allowing individuals under investigation of terrorist activities to be placed into home detention, Prime Minister Tony Blair argued that such measures were necessary given current levels of global threat.
    - Mr. Blair stated that since September 11th 2001 numerous plots had been uncovered across the United Kingdom involving terrorism or other serious violence - figures which he described as concerning but not necessarily unexpected. 
    - He went on to say “the security services have identified hundreds if not thousands of potential terrorists” who require further action than can currently be taken through traditional criminal justice processes.
    - According to Mr. Blair this was an unacceptable state of affairs and something needed to change; he claimed that those suspected of planning or preparing acts of crime should face tougher punishment than simply being released pending a court hearing or trial. 
    - To achieve this goal, the British Government proposed introducing Home Detention Curfews (HDC) for individuals deemed high risk by police – although critics pointed out that the definition of what constituted a ``high risk'' suspect remained unclear and open to interpretation. Critics also raised concerns over potential abuse associated with HDC regimes due to their use of secret evidence gathering techniques and lack of judicial oversight ; moreover they questioned whether or not civil liberties would remain protected under these laws. 
    - Despite these reservations, Mr. Blair insisted that the proposal posed a balanced compromise between public safety needs and individual rights safeguards; he highlighted that all detainees would need prior approval before being granted HDCs and stressed that any violation would result in immediate review process overseen directly by judges. Additionally Mr. Blair noted that proper safeguards had already been put in place to protect vulnerable groups including minors and persons living alone from excessive restriction imposed through such policies.

"Voters `Do Not Trust Politicians` 
Eight out of ten (8) British citizens believe that politicians are not honest and cannot be relied upon as sources of factual information. A recent survey commissioned by BBC Research Center found that only 22 percent of participants expressed trust in politicians to provide accurate information. These results show a stark contrast between public opinion and political discourse among Britain’s leaders. 
The study also revealed that87% of respondents thought politicians failed to keep their promises. This is particularly troubling given the importance of keeping promises during an electoral cycle. It indicates that there may be a significant gap between what politicians say and what they actually achieve.
These findings come amidst a global trend towards greater skepticism toward traditional institutions. In many countries, including Britain, people have become increasingly critical of governments and other authorities. This has been attributed to factors such as economic instability, growing inequality, and widespread corruption. As a result, more individuals feel disconnected from the political process than ever before. 
Despite this disillusionment, some politicians remain optimistic that increased transparency and accountability will help rebuild public faith in government. For instance, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently pledged to create an online database where all MPs must register any conflicts of interest. He argued that this could restore trust by allowing constituents to see if their representatives were acting in their best interests or simply pursuing personal gain. However, it remains unclear whether such measures will prove effective in reversing long-standing trends toward distrustful attitudes.
Meanwhile, foreign policy experts warn that waning confidence in international organizations like NATO can lead to further geopolitical tensions. With US President Donald Trump calling into question America's commitment to allies, critics argue that his policies risk destabilizing already precarious relationships around the world. Some analysts suggest that Europe should take action now to strengthen its own defense capabilities in order to reduce reliance on American protectionism. But few Europeans seem willing to make difficult decisions regarding military spending or diplomatic initiatives which might compromise existing power dynamics within NATO. Instead, most nations appear content merely talking about how important alliances should remain even when faced with threats posed by Russia and China – without doing anything tangible to ensure those commitments materialize over time!",phi2,1
"The Millennium Dome was meant to be a state-of-the-art cultural attraction, but its first venture as a public venue was met with disaster. After the successful completion of the millennium exhibition, the British Government attempted to capitalize on its popularity by opening it to the public as a museum. Despite efforts to make the stadium a success, the Palace of Sport was heavily criticized for overspending on maintenance and sales. 

Despite estimates placing the opening costs of the dome at 7 million pounds, ticket revenues could only bring in 6 million pounds. While this might seem like an insignificant amount, it marked a significant loss of money for the British Government. To compound matters further, the final cost of the project skyrocketed to 28.7 million pounds during its 4 year lifespan, making it one of the most expensive ever undertaken by Britain. 

In an effort to uncover what had gone wrong, the National Audit Office conducted a thorough investigation into the matter. After examining various records, they concluded that there had been excessive involvement of different organizations in the planning and execution of the project. This, along with poor marketing strategies and other costly mistakes, led to its ultimate failure. 

Although the Millennium Dome is now seen as a monument to the failures of the British Government, some are still able to appreciate the experience it provided to visitors. With innovative attractions such as the Globe Theatre and O2 Arena, the Dome remains an iconic part of London's cultural landscape. It serves as a reminder of the importance of proper planning and strategy when launching new initiatives, and the consequences which can arise from their failure.

"The Woolf Murder Case: Reevaluating Justice 
    England and Wales are facing major changes following the recent decision of the Sentencing Guidelines Council. The council, chaired by renowned legal scholar Dame Janet Smith, proposed significant modifications in sentencing guidelines for serious crimes such as murder. However, their initial recommendation faced intense criticism from lawmakers and advocacy groups alike due to concerns over fairness and retribution. Three months later, after careful consideration of public feedback and expert opinions, the council's plans were revised. While some argue that this watering down dilutes justice, others believe it is a necessary step towards promoting rehabilitation within the criminal justice system. This shift in policy marks a pivotal moment in English and Welsh law enforcement efforts and raises important questions regarding the role of guilt plea and leniency in achieving true accountability.

"The United Kingdom (UK) “has wasted billions of taxpayers’ money on hundreds of unnecessary and overlapping government agencies, according to a major new study. 

It called for an end to what it described as the ‘unproductive bureaucracy” created by the quangos – independent body which oversee policy and act as monitors of government performance. 

The report, published by the Institute for Government (IfG), made more than 60 recommendations for reform of the quango system. 

Government officials have long argued that quangos play an important role in improving transparency, accountability and governance. They argue they provide an additional layer of scrutiny over government decisions. 

But the IfG found that much of this work was ineffective, expensive and often redundant. 

To make matters worse, the cost of maintaining all of these organisations costs Britain 10 percent of its budget, according to the report. 

The study recommends reducing the number of quangos through the use of the Civil Service Reform Plan, which will aim to reduce the number of civil servants by 80,000 over the next five years. 

It also suggested that the Treasury should consider merging or abolishing some quangos, such as the Health Protection Agency, to eliminate any potential overlap between their roles. 

In addition, there should be greater clarity around the functions of quangos and how they interact with government departments, so that there is less duplication of effort. 

The report concluded that unless significant reforms were made, the quango system would continue to drain public resources and hinder progress towards achieving better value for money from public spending. 

Many political leaders have already begun to express support for the need to overhaul the quango system, suggesting that it could save millions of taxpayer dollars and improve efficiency. 

However, others remain unconvinced and raise concerns about the impact such changes may have on the quality and availability of certain services provided by quangos.""""""

"The question to be asked in the referendum on the EU Constitution, which could decide the future of Europe as we know it, has been revealed by the government.It will be : ``Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a new constitutional structure for the European Union?''

 
The proposed Treaty establishes what would effectively make the EU a supranational state - an ever-expanding federal bureaucracy running much like a large city-state with its own legislature, courts and immigration laws, instead of just being made up of nation states. If approved, the UK would still retain some autonomy in areas such as trade, foreign policy, and agriculture, but most other decisions would have to be agreed upon by all member states. This means that the UK would lose almost all control over its legislation, making it mere another subject to the European Court of Justice. 

The proponents of this move argue that it would create a more stable, prosperous and safe continent-wide community. They claim that the union would act as a beacon of peace, allowing countries to work together in harmony and prosperity, rather than competing against each other. Opponents, however, worry that it would give too much power to the EU, taking away the sovereignty of individual nations. They also fear that the EU might turn into a totalitarian superstate with a dictatorial leader at its head. 

The debate around this issue has been heatedly contested with both sides raising their voices strongly in defence of their stance. Those in favour of the treaty believe that having a unified Europe makes sense from a political, economic and security perspective, while those opposing it feel that doing so would be a dangerous precedent. With the referendum now under way, only time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

"News Article : Labour targets 'Hardcore Truants' 

    Education Minister Ruth Kelly today announced a new initiative aimed at tackling chronic absenteeism among young people. The scheme will involve targeted interventions for those who persistently miss classes or fail to meet attendance requirements set out under their individual education plan (IEP). 

The move comes as part of an ongoing effort to reduce truancy rates across England which are currently running significantly higher than they were prior to the introduction of National Minimum Standards more than fifteen years ago. 

Minister Kelly said “We know from previous initiatives that this kind of hard core truancy can be extremely damaging to both victims and perpetrators – so it’s essential we take action now to address it. Our aim is twofold - to help children stay engaged in learning; but also ensure parents understand how important attending class regularly really is for the wellbeing of their child. We believe these measures should lead to a decrease in long-term absence rates nationally"". 

These new proposals come just weeks after research showed that one in thirteen students nationwide struggle to attend lessons consistently due either directly or indirectly through family circumstances such as financial hardship or health problems. In addition, recent figures released indicate that while some improvements have been made over the past decade in bringing down overall levels of absenteeship amongst primary aged learners; secondary age groups still represent around half of all absences reported each year. 

It remains unclear exactly how much money or resources ministers intend to dedicate towards implementing these plans given current austerity measures ; however, Ms Kelly insisted she was committed to making sure no student would ever feel forced into leaving class without understanding why it mattered and having access to the necessary support services needed if required. 

``This government understands how difficult life can get sometimes,'' concluded the minister, ``but ultimately it's not worth sacrificing your educational progress because of something like missing school too often.''

"The world is abuzz as political campaigns continue ramping up in preparation for this year's elections. Both major parties, Labour and Conservative, have been accused of violating campaign regulations by making numerous phone calls without proper authorization. The Independent Commission on Election Referendums (ICESR) has found evidence suggesting that both parties have crossed the line when it comes to contacting registered voters.

According to the ICESR report, there were several instances where Labour and the Tories made calls during restricted hours or attempted to engage with individuals through unsolicited marketing messages instead of focusing on policy discussions relevant to voter interests. These actions raise concerns over the integrity and fairness of the electoral process, as well as potential breaches of privacy rights.

Labour has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and argued that the majority of their outreach efforts were targeted towards reaching out to undecided voters and engaging them in meaningful conversations about their policies and plans for governance. They maintain that the purpose of these contacts was entirely non-commercial and aimed at fostering democratic engagement rather than pushing a specific agenda.

On the other hand, the Tory party has also come under scrutiny regarding their call tactics. While they acknowledge some lapses in adherence to campaigning guidelines, they argue that overall, their approach remains within legal boundaries. They emphasize their commitment to transparency and accountability, stating that every effort has been made to ensure compliance with regulations governing election campaigns.

In light of these allegations, the Liberal Democrats have called upon the Electoral Commission to take swift action against those responsible for breaching the rules. They argue that stricter enforcement is necessary to prevent further violations and protect the integrity of future elections. Furthermore, they believe that implementing harsher penalties will serve as an effective deterrent against unethical practices.

Despite the controversy surrounding the issue, one thing remains clear – both Labour and the Conservatives must address these concerns head-on if they wish to regain public trust and credibility. It is imperative that politicians demonstrate ethical conduct throughout their campaigns and focus on substantive debates centered around important issues facing society. By doing so, they can foster a sense of confidence among constituents and ensure a fair and transparent democratic process.

"Tory Health Checks Unveiled as Part of Election Proposal
The Opposition Conservative Party has announced their proposals on healthcare during this year's general election. 
The party hopes that introducing health checks upon arrival for migrants who wish to stay in the United Kingdom for six months or longer will help to reduce the risk of tuberculosis (TB) being spread among the population.
It is reported that people coming from countries with high rates of TB should have a compulsory medical examination when entering the country. These individuals would then require NHS care, either privately or publicly funded. 
This measure was suggested by the British Medical Association, which argued that it is crucial to prevent the potential spread of disease from overseas. 
The government had previously proposed similar measures, such as increased screening and testing of refugees and asylum-seekers. However, former Prime Minister Theresa May rejected these proposals due to practical difficulties in implementing them.
The Conservative Party believes that its proposal is better suited to current conditions and could still be effective at reducing the spread of TB. They also point out that other western nations, including Germany, France, Canada and Australia, already have similar policies in place. OUTPUT: At a glance: Tories propose mandatory health tests for immigration

If elected to power, the Conservative Party plans to implement health checks for all those seeking entry into the United Kingdom from foreign countries where TB rates are higher than average. This policy aims to protect public safety and prevent the further spread of diseases like tuberculosis. 

The new policy, outlined by Conservative MP Sarah Jones, proposes that anyone planning to reside in the U.K. for six months or longer must undergo a comprehensive medical assessment prior to entry. Those deemed at risk of having contracted TB would be given access to free treatment within the National Health Service (NHS). 

Jones stated that this policy is long overdue. She added that “this is not just about protecting the British public from harm but showing solidarity with our global community”. 

Critics of the policy argue that the implementation process would be costly and time consuming. Additionally some feel that it could unfairly target certain ethnic groups. 

Despite criticism, the Conservative Party remains confident in its decision to move forward with the policy. They believe that by taking proactive steps now to address potential future threats, the Government can ensure greater public safety while maintaining an open door policy towards those wishing to make the U.K. their home.

"The Tories have attacked Labour for ‘dodging’ accountability when they announced plans that would see Tony Blair continue his political influence, rather than stepping down from power. 

In what is being seen as an attempt to hide the former Prime Minister's involvement in government policy, Labour has announced a new set of measures intended to boost their chances of regaining power at the next general election.

These measures include an increased focus on local campaigning; greater investment in digital advertising campaigns; and the creation of a special unit devoted solely to attacking Tory policies and initiatives during the course of the campaign.

Shadow Chancellor Sajid Javid warned that Labour was attempting to avoid facing up to its mistakes by engaging in this kind of manoeuvreery. He argued that such tactics were only designed to deceive voters into thinking that Labour was willing to take them seriously.

It comes after Theresa May called off her own leadership challenge earlier this year amid criticism over her handling of Brexit.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today program, former Home Secretary Jack Straw revealed his thoughts on how they might look like and emphasized the urgency of taking action now.

As the country prepares itself for another general election campaign, Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed concern over Miliband's comments regarding immigration being seen as ""a big negative."" However, despite Cameron's reservations, the government has decided not to rule out discussing migration during the upcoming elections. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition currently holds a majority in Parliament but is facing criticism for failing to address key economic issues and implement necessary welfare cuts within its first 100 days in office. Additionally, some argue that the government's handling of public services may have contributed to a decline in popularity since 2010. 

Despite the growing opposition towards the coalition, both Labour and Liberal Democrats remain committed to maintaining their positions throughout the entire duration of the next parliament.

"MPs' report expresses concerns over automatic reduction in murder sentences 
The influential Commons Home Affairs Committee has released a statement raising serious questions regarding the current state of punishment given to individuals convicted of murdering someone. According to their findings, prisoners sentenced for killing another person should have their penalties enhanced rather than diminished just because they accepted guilt without trial – a practice that the MP's deem as unethical by saying it undermines public trust in the justice system.

The committee has gathered evidence from several sources which suggests that people who accept culpability before being proven innocent are more likely to reoffend compared to those who had trials conducted in court. This is partly due to them failing to understand the full consequences of their actions and so continuing to commit criminal behaviour. As a result, the government needs to find ways to ensure criminals truly appreciate the gravity of their offences and are deterred from future misconduct.

In addition to this, the report calls for stricter punishments for those found to have been drinking or taking drugs at the time of committing a crime—a measure that many argue would help reduce recidivism rates since substance abuse can often lead people to engage in violent activities. To achieve this goal, the MPs propose introducing drug-related aggravations when determining sentences – something which does not currently exist within legislation..",phi2,1

During the program, Kennedy discussed the current state of affairs within Britain's government and its effect on citizens. He spoke of the need for greater transparency from all parties, and argued that only through increased openness and accountability could trust be rebuilt between the electorate and their leaders.
Kennedy also addressed the upcoming referendum on the European Union, arguing that it was essential to educate voters about the implications of an EU exit. He urged politicians to focus on promoting constructive dialogue, rather than focusing solely on their own vested interests. 
The President of the Liberal Democratic Party added that there needed to be more opportunities for people to participate in the decision-making process. He called for the establishment of a democratic platform where citizens can express their opinions directly to policy makers. This would help ensure that policies are created in accordance with the will of the public, rather than just by those in power.
In addition to these proposals, Kennedy suggested increasing funding for education so that everyone has access to quality information. He proposed introducing compulsory civic education courses in schools and universities so that students are better informed about the political system. This would enable them to make educated decisions when they cast their votes during elections.

In addition to the tax credit changes, the budget also included measures to help those on lower incomes. These include an increase in child benefit and working tax credits, which should help to ease financial pressures for struggling families.

In an interview this past week, the Minister stated “I want to send out a clear message to all those who engage in such hateful activities – I have no tolerance for racism or any other form of hatred.” This was followed by an equally firm statement denouncing the actions of individuals engaging in such acts. 

Cathy Jamieson went on to explain that action needs to be taken more seriously when it comes to addressing sectarian violence in Scotland. With this in mind, she proposed stricter punishments for those found guilty of hate crimes as well as increased support services for victims. The Minister also announced plans to launch educational programs in schools which focus on promoting tolerance and understanding amongst young people. 

These moves come at a time when tensions between different religious communities in Scotland remain high. Since the start of 2019 alone, there have been over 100 incidents reported involving anti-social behavior linked to religion or ethnicity. Much of this has been focused around the two main football teams in the country – Celtic and Rangers - whose supporters often face hostility from each other due to their respective religious backgrounds.

In response to the growing trend of sectarian violence, the Ministry of Justice is now considering introducing new legislation designed to protect citizens from extremist groups who promote hatred based on race, gender or sexuality. This could include tougher sentences for offenders convicted of hate crime offences as well as additional resources for law enforcement agencies tasked with investigating such cases. 

It remains to be seen whether or not these proposals will be successful in reducing the incidence of racial prejudice across Scotland. Nevertheless, Minister Jamieson's statements show her commitment to making Scotland a safe place for everyone, regardless of their background. By taking decisive action and implementing meaningful reforms, she hopes to ensure that Scotland can become a truly inclusive society where everyone feels valued and respected.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke said that agreement had already been struck with several countries to allow for the safe deportation of such detainees. He was not able to name which nations had come to an accord, but said that the decision had been welcomed by the British public.
 
This comes after a landmark ruling from the House of Lords, which found that the current system of detaining suspected terrorists posed a significant risk to those detained. Judges have long argued that detention without trial violates human rights laws, so the Lord’s Court decided it must be reformed. The government is now creating new procedures to ensure that detainees are treated fairly and safely.

It is clear that the UK takes the issue of national security very seriously – and is taking decisive action to address potential risks. By cooperating with other governments and implementing robust counter-terrorism policies, the country is demonstrating its dedication to protecting citizens from harm.

"The country was shocked today as thousands of Hunt supporters gathered for their annual rally. Hundreds of protesters had turned out near the gates of Parliament, wielding torches and chanting slogans.

The rally was held in response to recent changes to the Hunting Act 2004 which banned the hunting of wild animals with dogs. It is believed that this new legislation unfairly targets those who enjoy the sport.

At the rally, Prime Minister Theresa May was addressed by the group's leader, Richard Leese. He urged her to make sure that the Hunting Act remains unchanged. He argued that the act should not be used to interfere with people's recreational activities.

In addition to speeches from local politicians, there were several performances by bands and dancers. The mood was energetic and passionate, with many attendees showing their support for the cause through banners and costumes.

Despite the large turnout, many members of the public were unaware of the protests taking place. This could be due to the fact that they live in areas where hunting is rarely discussed or even accepted.

This event highlights the ongoing political divide between pro-hunting and anti-hunting groups in Britain. While some argue that hunting is an important tradition and part of British culture, others believe that it is cruel and unnecessary. Whether or not the current laws will remain in place remains to be seen. 

As the debate continues, one thing is certain: the hunt supporters' passion for the sport shows no signs of waning. With more rallies planned in the future, it seems that this issue will continue to dominate political discourse for some time yet.

"Political Squabble Escalates Between Blairs & Browns
It's becoming all too common to see pundits, columnists and politicians debate whether Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown can ever get along. They're like two small children fighting over who has the better toy, but their arguments often feel more like grown-ups throwing punches. 

Some say that Blair and Brown must learn to put aside childish things and focus on leading Britain through difficult times. After all, they both have important jobs to do; Blair is responsible for foreign affairs while Brown oversees domestic policy. Yet their constant disagreements make it seem as if their positions are irreconcilable. The public grows tired of listening to them bicker, and many wonder when they will find some kind of compromise or solution.

But perhaps we should look at this situation differently. Perhaps Blair and Brown aren't simply squabbling toddlers, after all. Maybe their quarrels reveal something deeper – the underlying tension between different visions of how the country should run. On the one hand, you have those who believe that government intervention and regulation are necessary to ensure fairness and equality. On the other hand, there are those who think that markets should be left alone so that people can achieve success based solely upon merit. 

These opposing views represent larger debates within society, ones which don't always lend themselves easily to resolution. For example, take healthcare reform: should the NHS remain free at the point of delivery, regardless of ability to pay? Or would it be fairer to allow individuals to purchase private insurance plans instead? Similarly, taxation raises questions about how much responsibility each individual has for contributing to the greater good. Some want higher taxes for the wealthy, whilst others call for lower taxes across the board.

In short, it seems unlikely that Blair and Brown can ever truly come together on any issue. Their fundamental differences go far beyond petty arguments; they reflect broader divisions among the British population. To expect otherwise would be wishful thinking at best. 

Theory Of Mind Exercises:
1) What if Tony Blair had never been elected leader of the Labour Party? How might his relationship with Gordon Brown have evolved differently?
2) If Blair did succeed in implementing policies he wanted without opposition from Brown, what impact would this have had on the public perception of the duo?
3) Suppose Brown was able to successfully sway opinion towards his side during the dispute. Would his leadership style have changed significantly since then?

"'Police officers in London, England recently urged local councils to take action to prevent the further spread of crime. The force is calling for new laws which would grant them more power to temporarily shut down disruptive establishments such as pubs, bars, and nightclubs. It could mean closing these places for up to one week, or even indefinitely. 

The association of chief police officers (ACPO) has supported the measure, suggesting that it should be implemented immediately. ACPO's head, Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Fox, argued that the current legislation was insufficient when dealing with troublesome properties. He noted that existing regulations only last for 24 hours and so may have limited effectiveness. 

Mr Fox's comments come at the same time as debates rage across Britain regarding the proposal to permit pubs and other drinking establishments to remain open throughout the night. In addition to adding to noise levels, late-night licensing could increase the risk of violence and crime. John Davies, MP for Labour, has raised concerns about the potential consequences for public safety if this decision were to be granted. 

In their response to the proposals, police authorities will no doubt stress the critical importance of protecting citizens from hazardous conditions. With alcohol related crimes already accounting for a significant portion of violent offenses, giving law enforcement greater power to intervene is clearly essential. By enforcing stricter measures for premises that fail to comply with the law, government can ensure that the health and safety of the public is not put at risk.'

"The meeting of thousands of Conservative delegates marks an important opportunity to determine the future direction of the country. With elections just around the corner, party leaders have gathered from all over the United Kingdom to declare their plans for the coming years. 

Prime Minister Gordon Brown's reign has been marked by several difficult decisions and critics have often highlighted his lackluster performance. He has faced immense criticism for his handling of the economy, health care and war in Iraq. Many citizens feel that he has not done enough to bring prosperity to Britain. 

In contrast, Prime Minister Tony Blair's success is seen by many as having been due to his innovative policies and vision for the country. He has implemented numerous reforms aimed at improving education, healthcare and social security. His successor will likely need to build on this work if the Conservatives hope to reclaim power. 

The Tories are highlighting what they see as a clear choice between them and Labour. They are promising a “new direction” for Britain, one which focuses on reducing bureaucracy, lowering taxes and creating jobs. Such measures aim to create a stronger economy and reduce poverty. Additionally, they plan to invest more in national infrastructure, such as roads and railways, to improve transportation and communication networks. 

Trade unions have expressed concern about the possible effects of these changes. They worry that lower wages and fewer benefits could harm workers' livelihoods. However, the Conservatives argue that these measures are necessary to encourage business growth and ensure economic stability. 

The Liberal Democrats have also voiced their opposition to some of the proposed policies. They believe that the Conservatives do not go far enough in terms of addressing inequality or environmental issues. Despite differences among parties, there was agreement among delegates that something needed to be done to address the challenges facing British society. 

It remains to be seen how successful the new conservative leader will be when the next election takes place. Only time will tell whether the party can fulfill its promise of bringing positive change to the nation.

"The recent rise in deaths among prisoners, detainees and people held within correctional facilities across Europe is proving to be a major challenge for governments and policy-makers. At least 1 prisoner dies in the United Kingdom every week, which is more than twice the global average, according to analysis by Amnesty International. While some countries have seen dramatic increases in their mortality rates over the past few years, others have witnessed relatively stable figures. However, the issue remains widespread across the continent. 

In an effort to get ahead of the crisis, several European nations have implemented new policies aimed at reducing prison populations and improving conditions for inmates. In Germany, for example, there has been a significant drop in the number of homicides in recent years – from 30 per 100,000 prisoners in 2005 to just 15 per 100,000 today. Similarly, Norway has managed to reduce its homicide rate amongst female prisoners by nearly 50 percent since 2001. 

At the same time, many Western democracies are struggling to address the root causes behind rising crime levels, as well as the overcrowding and poor treatment experienced by those inside jail. France, Spain and Italy have all recently introduced tough sentencing laws designed to deter offenders and increase security within prisons. Despite this, critics argue that such measures may actually do little to reduce reoffending rates long-term, leading to further incarceration and potential harm to society. 

While it's clear that something needs to be done to ensure the safety of both prisoners and guards, it's also important to remember why we detain criminals in the first place—to protect society from further violence and criminal activity. Therefore, while harsher punishments may provide short-term satisfaction, addressing the underlying issues -such as poverty and lack of education– could lead to greater long-term benefits if they help prevent individuals from turning to crime. It's essential that policymakers continue to evaluate their approaches and strategies so that they can make sound decisions based on the latest evidence.

"The government's top politician, Minister John Smith, is calling for a new approach when it comes to dealing with terrorism. No longer content with making deals and offering compromises that fail to have any real impact, Prime Minister Johnson insists on taking a hard line against those who threaten national security. 

In an exclusive interview with our reporters, John Smith stated “it’s time we had nothing further to discuss. We are not going to make any more concessions or compromises on this issue. If someone poses a threat to public safety then there should be no negotiation on the table. It’s time we took a strong stance and said no more."" 

Johnson went on to say that if necessary, ""we will take action to protect citizens without hesitation"". This could mean harsher prison sentences for terrorists, as well as increased surveillance powers granted by Parliament. He argued such measures were essential for maintaining Britain’s security, despite some opposition within Government circles. 

John Smith made sure to stress that while they would still seek to reach agreement whenever possible, their number one priority was protecting British lives. With that in mind, he concluded by saying “let us work together to find solutions which do justice to both security and civil liberties. Nothing less than the future of this nation is at stake here.”

"The arrest of Nick Griffin, the long time leader of the British National Party (BNP), came as no surprise to many in the political world. After being exposed by a recent BBC documentary, many of his followers were demoralized and began to distance themselves from him. Despite this, Griffin remained defiant and continued to lead the party, even going so far as to organize rallies and events promoting white supremacy. 

Despite the effort to discredit him, Griffin's influence remains intact. He continues to attract new members, and his message of hate and division continues to resonate with those who are desperate for a sense of identity. It is likely that he will remain a powerful force in UK politics for years to come. 

His latest arrest has only served to solidify his position as a leader of the country's far right. Many are wondering what impact this will have on the upcoming elections, but one thing is for sure: Griffin's influence persists, and he will not be deterred from achieving his goals.

"In today's political climate, it seems like disagreements and divisions between leaders only serve to weaken their ability to effectively govern. This sentiment could not be more apparent than in the current situation involving Prime Minister Tony Blair and his ongoing feud with former Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. The constant bickering between the two top figures within the government has been detrimental to both individuals' reputations and to the overall functioning of the country. 
Michael Howard, the Conservative Party Leader, expressed concern during this week's parliamentary debates that the split between Blair and Brown had reached such an extent that it was negatively impacting the governance of Britain. Howard argued, ""How can we expect them to tackle important issues like crime prevention when all they're doing is squabbling amongst themselves?"" His comment quickly gained traction among party members who shared similar sentiments.
Blair vehemently denied any intention to undermine or harm the governing process by engaging in public disputes. He dismissed Howard's claims, stating firmly that there were no internal divisions at play and that the focus should remain on addressing the pressing matters facing the nation. Despite Blair's reassurances, many believe that behind closed doors, tensions continue to simmer and hinder progress.
The divisive nature of Blair and Brown's relationship extends beyond mere personal differences; it also casts doubt on the cohesion of the entire cabinet. With influential figures openly criticizing one another publicly, doubts have arisen regarding the unity and collective decision-making power of those responsible for leading the country. As citizens observe their leaders engaged in petty conflicts instead of working together towards common goals, trust in the government diminishes further.
This strained dynamic between the two prominent politicians raises concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of British governance. It serves as a stark reminder of how even minor interpersonal clashes can have far-reaching consequences for a nation. Instead of focusing solely on domestic affairs and serving constituents, politicians find themselves embroiled in bitter battles for control and influence.
As the media continues to cover the ongoing feud, public opinion becomes increasingly divided. Supporters of both Blair and Brown voice their frustration, feeling torn between loyalty to their chosen leader and disillusionment with the state of national politics. In turn, this polarization fuels partisan rhetoric, exacerbating existing societal divisions and undermining efforts towards compromise and cooperation.
Amidst the chaos, ordinary citizens bear the brunt of the fallout from Blair and Brown's dispute. Their daily lives become overshadowed by political drama, leaving little room for meaningful engagement with issues that directly impact their well-being. The focus shifts away from policy development and implementation toward scrutinizing every interaction between ministers, diverting attention from essential tasks that require urgent resolution.
Ultimately, the ongoing quarrel between Blair and Brown demonstrates the inherent challenges of maintaining harmony within democratic systems. When key players prioritize personal vendettas over collaborative problem-solving, society suffers the consequences. The fractured relationships and lack of productive discourse threaten not only effective governance but also the very fabric of democracy itself.

"In an exclusive interview, former British Prime Minister Michael Howard revealed yesterday that he once skipped classes as a child. According to reports from The Sun, Howard spent most of his early days skipping class to hang out with some old schoolmates who played snooker. Despite admitting this habit caused “lasting harm”, the former MP maintained that it didn't have too much impact on his life or career.
 
When asked how truancy affected his education during those years, Howard responded by saying that while playing truant for leisure activities may sound harmless today, back then it wasn't seen so positively. He noted that schools were stricter than they are now when dealing with students missing lessons and that taking time off would be frowned upon even if there's no intention to skip ahead of course material entirely. In fact, Howard stated that strict actions should be taken against anyone caught breaking attendance rules - especially if their behavior becomes habitual over time (see full text below).


Based on the information provided above, consider three hypothetical political figures named A, B, C representing different parties. Each party is trying to pass new legislation related to truancy laws which includes harsh penalties similar to what Howard described. Party A argues that such measures will ensure student discipline; Party B emphasizes public safety concerns regarding unsupervised youths; Party C insists that educational disruption needs to be minimized through other means like counseling rather than punishment. Given these perspectives, each figure must decide whether their proposed legislation aligns more closely with Howard's views expressed earlier in the piece. Your task is to assign one figure (A,B,C) to either support or oppose Howard's statement based solely on their arguments without directly referring to the statements made by Howard himself.

Question: Which political figure do you think supports/opposes Howard's view? Explain your reasoning.


First, analyze each argument presented by each figure. 
Party A argues for increased disciplinary actions implying that Howard might agree considering his belief towards strict enforcement of attendance regulations regardless of intent causing long-term damage according to his own account. This suggests that Figure A agrees with Howard. 
On the contrary, both B and C argue against punitive measures, emphasizing rehabilitation efforts instead which contradicts Howard's emphasis on immediate corrective actions for repeated violations leading to significant disruptions. Thus, neither B nor C could possibly agree with Howard. 

By process of elimination using proof by exhaustion, we can conclude that only Party A's viewpoint corresponds exactly to the content shared by Howard, making them supportive of his opinion.  
Answer: Political figure A opposes Howard's view given that their stance matches precisely Howard's beliefs outlined previously.

"In today's election results, it is clear that the majority of voters are dissatisfied with the current state of politics. Voter turnout has reached an all-time low since 1977, indicating a general lack of interest or trust in political leaders and institutions. This trend is particularly concerning when compared to previous elections where voter engagement was significantly higher. 
The recent survey conducted by the Democratic Party shows a stark contrast between the views on economic policies. While 60% support increasing taxes for the rich, only 40% believe raising income levels for everyone else should be prioritized. This highlights a divide among voters regarding their perception of fairness and social justice within society. Furthermore, 70% express skepticism towards politicians who prioritize personal gains over serving the public, while 65% view them as corrupt individuals more focused on accumulating wealth rather than fulfilling their responsibilities. These findings suggest a growing disillusionment with the existing system of governance and a desire for greater transparency and accountability from elected officials. 
Overall, the upcoming parliamentary session promises to be highly contentious as various parties present their agendas and attempt to gain power. Voters have expressed concerns about immigration control, with 58% supporting stricter measures. Additionally, there is widespread opposition to increased military spending, with 62% opposing further investments in defense capabilities. Education remains a key issue, with 72% advocating for improved funding for schools, reflecting a strong belief in the importance of investing in future generations. In terms of foreign policy, 68% favor closer ties with NATO allies, demonstrating a commitment to international cooperation and collective security. Finally, 63% emphasize the need for better relations with Russia, highlighting both geopolitical considerations and aspirations for peaceful coexistence. 
It is evident that the outcome of this election holds significant implications for the direction of the nation. With such deep divisions among voters, it is crucial for candidates and policymakers to address the underlying issues fueling dissatisfaction and work towards finding common ground that can bridge the gaps. Failure to do so may result in continued disengagement, eroding faith in democratic processes and potentially leading to further polarization within society. Only through meaningful dialogue and inclusive decision-making can we hope to rebuild trust and restore confidence in our political systems.

"The UK government is planning to return Asylum-seeking children, many of whom do not even have their own parents. This decision has sparked a wave of criticism from human rights groups and politicians across the country. Many are calling for an immediate halt to this cruel policy, arguing that no child should ever be forced from their home and community abroad. 

This announcement comes just days after the United Nations' better protection standards for refugee children were widely applauded by leading human rights figures. These standards include stricter guidelines on detention centres and greater access to education and healthcare. Despite this progress, some governments continue to push forward with plans to repatriate unaccompanied minors, citing the need to protect national security.

With the UK at the forefront of this debate, many are questioning why the Government would choose to go against international law. Some argue that it is simply a matter of short term political gain, while others believe there might be more sinister motivations behind the plan. 

Whatever the reason, one thing remains clear: returning unaccompanied migrant kids to Albania poses a serious risk to their safety and wellbeing. Not only does it ignore the UN's recommendations on protecting refugees, but it also fails to take into account the complex social dynamics at play in the region. Forcing children away from their homes and communities will only serve to exacerbate existing tensions, leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.

Despite the backlash from human rights campaigners and politicians, Prime Minister Boris Johnson appears unphased. He insists that the new policy is necessary in order to keep Britain safe from potential terrorist threats. In addition, he claims that the government is doing everything possible to ensure that returned migrants receive adequate support upon arrival. 

However, critics argue that these assurances are meaningless without proper oversight and safeguards in place. Without strict monitoring processes, how can we be sure that the promised support is actually reaching its intended recipients? Moreover, what happens if children end up being sent back to dangerous environments – or worse – where they are subjected to physical or sexual abuse? 

These are all valid concerns, yet Johnson continues to defend the policy as a matter of necessity. It is clear that the issue is far from settled, and that further discussion and dialogue is needed before any decisions are made. Until then, we must remain vigilant and fight for the best interests of these vulnerable young people."" OUTPUT: Asylum children to face returns - The UK government is set to begin sending thousands of unaccompanied asylum seekers, including many who don't even have their own family members, back to Albania. The move, which began earlier today and is planned to commence within the next few weeks, has been met with widespread condemnation from human rights organisations and opposition parties alike. They say that this kind of action goes against both international law and basic decency, putting the lives and well-being of the most vulnerable among us at unnecessary risk. However, the Home Office maintains that such measures are essential for safeguarding the nation's borders and public safety - despite evidence showing otherwise. While the controversy surrounding this contentious topic shows no signs of abating anytime soon, the future of the situation still hangs in balance. We can only hope that our leaders find a way forward that respects the humanity of all involved, while still upholding our obligations under global conventions and protocols.",phi2,1

"Climate change could be completely out of control within several decades, according to experts. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) warned members of the Scotland’s parliament's environment committee that drastic measures needed to be taken in order to prevent this from happening. It said current trends showed that greenhouse gas emissions were increasing significantly, which would lead to more extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels. 

The SEPA made nine recommendations to the government, including finding ways to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy sources such as solar and tidal power, and promoting public transport, walking and cycling. “If we don’t take swift action now, we risk irreversible damage to the planet and all its inhabitants,” it concluded. 

A number of representatives from environmental agencies, businesses and universities attended the meeting, presenting studies into the effects of climate change and potential solutions. Many agreed that something had to be done, but disagreed over what should be done first. Some argued for writing new laws, while others suggested developing innovative technologies.

In summary, the Scottish MPs heard a compelling case for tackling climate change. Issues such as coal-fired power plants, deforestation, and inadequate waste management need to be addressed if Europe is to have any hope of meeting its targets and preventing catastrophic consequences. Therefore, the government must develop a comprehensive strategy for combatting climate change and make resources available for implementation.

The recent announcement from BAA is an excellent example of this. Despite facing opposition from some members of the public, BAA have continued to show their commitment to the development of Britain's airports. Already, they have made significant investments in infrastructure, creating thousands of jobs along the way. This shows that when companies invest in sustainable initiatives, everyone benefits – not just them but also society as a whole. 

At the same time, the Government has announced its plans to expand the current network of airports across the United Kingdom. While some people might see this move as threatening the environment or encroaching upon civil liberties, others believe it could bring great economic growth and job opportunities. It remains to be seen whether the High Court case against the proposed expansion will succeed or fail, but one thing is certain; the decision will no doubt influence the future of British aviation. 

Regardless of the outcome, we must remember what this issue is really about. It's about finding the right balance between progress and preserving the natural beauty of our planet. We need to find ways to develop without causing further harm to nature. That means taking responsibility for our own carbon footprints and investing in renewable energy sources where possible. 

To sum up, while BAA may face criticism for their operations, they remain committed to playing a vital role in the development of the nation's airports. And now, more than ever, citizens should take action to ensure that political decisions reflect their values and goals.

"This year, new research exposes yet another alarming example of inequality in our society. According to a study conducted by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), it has been revealed that teenagers from wealthier families have nearly six times the likelihood of attending university compared to their counterparts from disadvantaged communities. These findings shed light on the deep-rooted social disparities within our education system which continue to perpetuate an unfair advantage for some while leaving others behind.

 
The higher rate of access to universities among young adults from affluent backgrounds further highlights the stark differences in opportunities available based solely on socio-economic status. Despite efforts made over several decades to bridge this gap through initiatives such as increased funding and scholarships aimed at underprivileged individuals, progress seems painfully slow. This disparity not only affects educational outcomes but also perpetuates societal inequalities, creating barriers for upward mobility and reinforcing existing power structures.

It is disheartening to see how little change there was in terms of improving accessibility to higher education for economically disadvantaged individuals during the period from 1994 to 2000, despite the overall increase in participation rates across the country. While more women were able to pursue tertiary education during that time, men continued to be disproportionately represented in elite institutions, contributing to gender imbalances both inside and outside academia.

To address this issue effectively, we must prioritize equalizing opportunities for every individual regardless of their background or financial means. Implementing policies that provide greater support to marginalized groups, ensuring targeted investments in schools located in underserved areas, and offering tailored programs designed to enhance academic skills can significantly level the playing field and empower those who face systemic disadvantages. By doing so, we take important strides towards fostering a fair and just society where talent and potential triumph over socioeconomic circumstances.

While tackling inequality may seem like an uphill battle, it is essential that policymakers, educators, parents, and community leaders work together to dismantle barriers to education. Only then can we hope to create a future where everyone has an equitable chance to fulfill their dreams, irrespective of their zip code or parental wealth. It is high time that we acknowledge the urgent need for comprehensive reforms in our education systems and strive tirelessly toward building a truly inclusive society.

Richard Thomas, head of Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), stated today that he was ""urgently requesting'' further details from relevant authorities regarding this practice and warned that it was unacceptable behaviour.

"News Article : 

The United Kingdom’s Brexit process is currently making headlines around the world, and recently we have seen an interesting development in British politics. One such example came yesterday when the UK Independence Party (UKIP) announced that they were losing their Member of Parliament (MP) in London's South East constituency after he joined forces with another MP named Robert Kilroy-Silk from his own party. The announcement was unexpected but it could mean significant changes ahead if this partnership proves successful.

Robert Kilroy-Silk first became involved with the Conservative Party before joining UKIP back in 2005. However, despite some initial success at the polls over his tenure within both parties, he eventually decided against standing again in 2015 due to dissatisfaction with the direction taken by Prime Minister David Cameron. In addition to his decision not to stand for re-election last year, Kilroy-Silk has also been critical of the Conservative leadership team since then.

Kilroy-Silk believes strongly in taking Britain out of the European Union and wants to see more accountability and transparency in government decisions being made. As Deputy Leader of Veritas, which will be launching later this week, he hopes to bring together those who share similar views towards reforming the UK's relationship with Europe while ensuring greater democracy and representation for all people living in Great Britain. 

His move comes amid rising Euroscepticism among many Britons – particularly in areas where immigration levels are high or perceived as having increased too rapidly during the past decade. It remains to be seen how much support Kilroy-Silk can garner outside of his current constituencies but it seems likely that he'll face stiff competition in what promises to be a tight race between different candidates vying for the same seats across the country next month.

"The UK's political landscape was rocked today as Conservative party leader, Michael Howard accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of mishandling Britain’s immigration policy. In a statement to reporters during his visit to Canterbury East Local Government Association office, Howard condemned the “chaotic” state of Britain’s asylum system and blamed it on successive Labour governments' incompetence. 

Howard added that over the last four years, England's councils have spent over £3 billion on dealing with refugees from overseas- this amounts to almost 140 pounds for every man, woman and child in the country. He argued that the costs were unsustainable, particularly given the current economic climate. 

Making the accusation public comes at a time when anti-immigration sentiment among Conservatives is running high following a surge in illegal immigrants entering Europe via Greece. Last month, hundreds of thousands marched through cities across France calling for tighter border controls and increased security measures against those seeking refuge within its borders. Similarly, Howard's comments come after new figures showed that unemployment has reached record levels in many parts of the United Kingdom due to an influx of foreign workers. 

In response to Howard's remarks, Prime Minister Gordon Brown dismissed them as ""narrowly targeted"" and urged him to focus instead on tackling poverty and inequality throughout Great Britain. He pointed out that while some areas may be struggling financially due to large numbers of migrants coming into their communities, most regions had benefited greatly by attracting highly skilled professionals who could make important contributions to industry and science. 

Despite Brown's assurances, however, the debate around immigration shows no signs of slowing down soon. With both sides passionately arguing their points of view, only time will tell whether Britain can reach a consensus on how best to handle this complex issue. 
The recent increase in immigration poses a great challenge for the government which must balance humanitarian considerations with concerns about national security. It also highlights deep divisions within British society over who should be allowed entry to the country and what kind of support they need once here. Therefore, finding solutions to these issues requires thoughtful deliberation and collaboration between all stakeholders involved including politicians, civil servants, academics, business leaders and members of the public.

"The UK government is taking fresh measures in response to concerns over an impending Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic. Senior Member of Parliament, Edward Leigh calls for increased vigilance and preparation ahead of time.

Public Accounts Committee Chairman, Mr Leigh criticized the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs' (Defra), alleged lack of urgency and initiative when it comes to preparing for potential FMD outbreaks. In light of recent events such as the European Union's inability to contain bovine TB despite numerous attempts since 2010; MPs have become increasingly worried that the country may not receive adequate help should a similar scenario transpire here. 

It remains unclear if any long term solutions or preventive steps are being taken by Government officials in order to reduce chances of another major outbreak occurring due to this infectious virus which affects animals but can potentially spread to humans too.",phi2,1
"Kennedy, who served alongside Labour Prime Minister David Cameron for many years before becoming an independent MP, raised concerns over the current state of Britain’s political landscape. Addressing viewers of ‘Five Live’ today, he stated that there was currently a distinct “lack of faith in politicians from all sides"". 

He went to go further, arguing that this mistrust extended far beyond just the Labour Party, and blamed both parties equally for creating a political atmosphere devoid of trust. This sentiment was met with mixed reactions from other commentators, some of whom disagreed sharply with Kennedy’s view that the Liberal Democrats were not to blame. 

Still, it's clear to see why Kennedy feels so passionately about the issue; despite being part of the Conservative Party himself, he believes that neither major party is living up to its obligations to the British people. The country, he argued, needs more honesty and accountability from all sides if it is to make any real progress towards improving our current situation. 

The discussion then shifted back to the upcoming general election, with Kennedy warning against complacency amongst those hoping for change through voting Liberal Democrat. With no real alternative presented by either party, Kennedy suggested that such votes are ultimately futile - pointing out that the same problems will remain regardless of which party takes power. 

This point was echoed by fellow guest, journalist Andrew Neil, who spoke of how difficult it can be for citizens to feel like their voices matter when they believe nothing is going to change under any circumstances. Despite agreeing wholeheartedly that something must be done, Neil cautioned that simply throwing away one’s vote does little to actually improve things. 

In conclusion, it seems likely that feelings of distrust between Britons and their politicians may continue long after the next general election comes around. While it is important to remember to exercise your right to vote, it is equally vital to recognise that doing so alone cannot solve the deep-seated issues facing our society today. Only by working together can we hope to create a better future for ourselves and generations to come.

"In today's world, we all want democracy. We live in times where people are becoming increasingly aware of their rights and demanding more out of our political representatives. And one man who is leading this charge for greater democratic reform is Lord Kinnock – an experienced politician from the United Kingdom.

	Lord Kinnock, having accepted a place in the prestigious House of Lords recently, sees himself as someone who can make significant contributions towards achieving true democratic values. He believes that by being part of this upper chamber, he can use his years of experience to help push forward progressive change on issues such as civil liberties, human rights, equality, government transparency, electoral law reform, public participation in decision-making processes, campaign finance regulation and voting reform. 

It certainly won't be easy, however, given that even though the British government has agreed to some changes in terms of how much power the House of Commons holds over what happens in Parliament, there still remain many questions around who should be allowed into the House of Lords - something which has been fiercely contested among both Labour Party MPs and Liberal Democrats alike. The debate between those two sides has become evermore heated since last year when former Prime Minister Tony Blair called for reforms to the system; yet despite his efforts, there does not seem to have been any concrete movement made so far toward making meaningful changes. 

	Despite this lack of action, Lord Kinnock remains undeterred in pushing ahead with his mission, believing that if enough hard work is done and voices heard then real progress may come eventually. After all, he knows better than most just how powerful a voice united individuals can bring together in pursuit of common goals, and hopes that others too take up the cause of fighting for a fairer society through active engagement and involvement in politics.

	With his newfound position in the House of Lords, Lord Kinnock is set to join forces with other committed politicians across Europe to tackle pressing issues like corruption, inequality, poverty, unemployment, environmental degradation, climate change, racism and discrimination head on, using his unique perspective gained throughout the course of decades spent at Westminster to ensure lasting solutions are implemented for generations to come. If nothing else, his appointment serves as a reminder to us all that no matter how daunting or seemingly impossible our task might appear initially, success can always be achieved through persistence and collaboration.

According to an audit released by the United Kingdom's national accounting body, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), various countries have yet to consistently report cases of fraud and other financial misconduct when receiving funds from the European Union. 

Though audited data shows that incidents of abuse have gone down over the past decade, the European Commission’s own reports note there remains no uniform method across Europe for identifying fraudulent activities or punishing wrongdoers. In addition, the court system continues to be weighed down by cases involving improper use of EU money.

    Lyn Brown, the Labour candidate was chosen for West Ham, East London – a seat which is particularly diverse due to its high population of African and Caribbean communities. This move has raised questions among the local black community who feel that their voices were not being heard during the selection process. 

Ian McCartney, the Labour party chairman responded to the criticism by stating that he believes that the selection process was fair and transparent. He also argued that the Labour party is committed to increasing diversity on their candidacy list, and promised to take steps towards creating more inclusive policies. 

Despite the Labour party's efforts to increase diversity, they remain divided over how best to achieve it. Some argue for a quota system, while others believe that the current approach is sufficient.

"Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy has outlined his party's bold new policies aimed at improving the lives of women in Britain. 

The party is promising a range of measures to ensure that women have greater economic security, such as introducing a mandatory gender quota for boardrooms and ensuring more generous maternity leave benefits. 

Kennedy is also proposing innovative solutions to better support working mothers, like creating childcare facilities which would be affordable or even entirely free of charge. This could help to alleviate some of the stress associated with balancing work and family responsibilities. 

Moreover, the Lib Dem leadership team is keen to promote equality by advocating for laws that protect women from discrimination, both publicly and privately. They plan to develop stricter penalties for those who fail to abide by equal opportunity legislation, as well as launching educational campaigns to raise awareness of women's rights. 

The party also hopes to make life easier for older women, raising the retirement age to 70 by 2030 and introducing a universal state pension scheme. By doing this, they believe all women will receive the same level of financial protection when it comes to pensions. 

In addition to these policies, the Liberals are committed to tackling issues around domestic violence and sex crime. They hope to create safer communities for women, by increasing funding for victim support services and developing tougher sentences for offenders. 

It is clear that the Lib Dem leadership is fully aware of the challenges facing women in today's society, and are eager to do whatever it takes to improve their lives. With their comprehensive set of proposals, the party is hoping to win over female voters and make real progress towards true gender equality.

"The Conservative party is facing allegations of Anti-semitism after their prospective candidate, Andrew Mennear released a post criticizing the recent Labour campaign. This came in response to a controversial election poster from the opposition party featuring former Prime Minister Michael Howard and current Cabinet member, Lord Letwin, depicted on wings like pigs. According to reports by several media outlets, including Sky News and The Telegraph, Mennear labelled this image “tasteless” and “offensive"", stating that there was no doubt that such an approach would only serve to divide people further rather than bring them together. 
Mr Mennear went onto say he had been made aware of the issue through his constituents – many of whom were part of the local Jewish community located near Finchley. He urged all parties involved to show respect for each other's beliefs instead of resorting to tactics which may be seen as divisive or hateful. In addition, Mr Mennear highlighted the importance of having meaningful conversations between different sides in order to understand one another better.

"The Conservative party has come out against the idea of imprisoning people in houses, expressing serious concerns over the proposed House Arrest Scheme. This is an alarming move by the ruling Liberal Democrats who are trying to push through new measures without taking into account public opinion. 

Opponents of this plan argue that it will give too much power to politicians as they can impose arbitrary restrictions on those deemed ‘a threat’ even if there isn't enough evidence to suggest criminal intent. Critics also point out that it sets dangerous precedents by allowing governments to effectively bypass due process when dealing with suspected terrorists or individuals accused of crimes such as drug trafficking. 

These fears were further fuelled after Prime Minister John Smith suggested last week at his daily press conference held in Downing Street London - where he announced several controversial policies aimed at controlling immigration levels throughout Europe during 2008. Smith argued that the current system was outdated & inefficient, leading him to propose radical changes like increased border security along all borders between countries within our common market zone (EMEA).

"Straw attacked on Chinese Arms Moves. Following days long protests in Tiananmen Square, where protesters were violently suppressed by Chinese security forces in June 1989, the Eastern Bloc's response to the unrest has remained a contentious issue among international communities ever since. 
    Last week, the European Union (EU) made headlines when it announced plans to repeal its fifteen-year-old ban on exporting military equipment to China. The move has been strongly criticized by human rights activists, as well as some members of the British government.

Jack Straw, the UK’s foreign secretary, has expressed his opposition to the decision, arguing that lifting the ban could aid China in developing weapons systems that could be used against its own citizens. “Exporting arms to Hong Kong is not in our interests or the best way forward for Europe, nor can we turn a blind eye to what is happening in Tibet and elsewhere,” he told reporters. He went on to say that a stronger EU position on human rights issues would be preferable to taking such steps.

The Chinese government responded swiftly to the announcement, accusing the West of attempting to interfere in its internal affairs. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London quickly denied any wrongdoing, stating that the country had no intention of using exported weapons to commit atrocities.

Despite the controversy surrounding the decision, many experts believe that removing the export restrictions may actually benefit both parties involved. By continuing to sell military technology to Chinese companies, Western nations will be able to gain valuable insights into their tactics and strategies. Furthermore, the sale of modern weaponry could help bolster the economy of countries like France and Germany, which are heavily reliant on defense contracts from other states.

"The latest political developments in Britain are causing much consternation, as Labour leader Gordon Brown has once again been plunged into turmoil. It all began several months ago when it was revealed that the former home secretary David Blunkett had granted his lover’s daughter permission to stay in the UK despite having no legal basis for doing so. This decision immediately sparked outrage among Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who called for an independent investigation into whether or not Mr Blunkett had abused his position. After weeks of heated debate, the government finally relented and established a special committee to look into the issue.
 
When the findings from this Committee were released last week, they provided little consolation to those dissatisfied with the outcome. While Sir Alan Budd managed to link some circumstantial evidence together which suggested that Mr Blunkett may be responsible for granting his lover's daughter asylum status, he failed to definitively prove her guilt beyond doubt. As such, many people feel there is still more work to do before any kind of conclusion can be reached regarding what happened here.
 
Despite these criticisms, one thing remains certain; the Blunteltrow case should serve as a wakeup call to everyone involved in British politics. No matter how powerful you are or how high your profile, you will always face consequences if you abuse your authority or act unethically – something that even someone like Lord Goldsmith could not avoid. We must learn from the mistakes of others and make sure history does not repeat itself. Only then can we truly build a society based on justice and fairness for all.

"News Article on Politics with Starting Words:

Michael Howard, who is currently serving as the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has recently been in the spotlight for his role in advocating for the introduction of identity documents. In this article, we will explore how Howard's stance on the matter came into being and what led him to make such a decision. 

At first glance, it may seem like there were no significant differences within the Conservative Party when it comes to the implementation of new policies. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the party's views are far from united. For instance, some members believe that ID cards should be mandatory while others argue against their necessity. As a result, the Conservatives have found themselves divided over whether or not to support them. 

Despite this division, Michael Howard chose to take a stand by supporting the introduction of ID cards. This move sparked controversy among other Shadow Cabinet ministers, many of whom disagreed with the plan. Nevertheless, Howard maintained that he made the right call because the Police Service believed that having identification documents could help prevent crime more effectively.

While Howard's decision might appear straightforward enough at first glance, it was actually a difficult one to make. It required extensive discussions amongst all members of his Front Bench Team before reaching a “collective view” which he believes he did successfully achieve. Despite admitting that the issue wasn't an easy one, Howard remained adamant that the benefits of introducing ID cards outweighed any potential drawbacks.

The recent events surrounding the Tories' approach towards ID card legislation demonstrate that despite outward appearances, parties can often disagree significantly internally. Although Howard's position appears firm now, it remains uncertain if the same level of consensus will hold up in future debates concerning similar issues.",phi2,1
"The Conservative Party has released their long-awaited election manifesto ahead of the June 8th polls.  Michael Howard's leadership team has spent the past few months compiling their plans to reduce taxes, balance the budget and increase security; all in an effort to support the ""forgotten middle ear"".

The manifesto focuses on three main points - justice, economy, and morale - aiming to create stability and prosperity for all British citizens. Justice involves reforming the criminal justice system, such as introducing tougher sentences for offenders, and giving greater power to police officers. On the economic front, the plan includes reducing government spending, cutting taxes and promoting investment. Finally, intent is on boosting morale through public services, including better education, healthcare and infrastructure. 

Michael Howard also makes use of several short stories to highlight his points. For example, the story of a young family struggling to make ends meet despite both parents working full-time highlights the need for a reduction in the tax burden. Another tells of a small business owner defeated by excessive regulation, and how freeing businesses from unnecessary bureaucracy could help them to grow. 

In addition, the manifesto outlines numerous initiatives to promote equality and tackle discrimination. This includes increasing diversity in the workplace, creating new opportunities for minority groups, and ensuring that everyone has access to quality education regardless of their background. 

The policy document also prioritizes climate change, pledging to invest in renewable energy sources, while making sure to develop strategies to mitigate any negative effects of transitioning away from fossil fuels.

Overall, Michael Howard's manifesto presents an array of practical solutions designed to improve the lives of ordinary Britons. It remains to be seen whether these ideas will be enough to persuade voters in the upcoming election, but the conservatism party hopes they have laid out a compelling case that they are the best choice for Britain's future.

"The recent North East Assembly Referendum is rapidly approaching, and the race between the ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns has become increasingly heated. In this highly contested political climate, one man who seems determined to have a major impact on the outcome is none other than Robert ""Robocop"" Mallon, the former Middlesbrough Mayor who was recently appointed by Labour leader Andy Burnham. 

With just two days remaining until the voting day, tensions are running high and both sides of the argument are working tirelessly to promote their respective positions. Despite being from different parties, Burnham saw value in bringing someone like Mallon aboard - after all, he's no stranger to tackling tough challenges head-on. And that exactly what Mallon plans to do if elected – make sure that everyone's voice gets heard and put an end to the current state of chaos that plagues the region. 

In order to better understand how Mallon intends to accomplish this mission, we had the chance to talk to him earlier today. He spoke at length regarding his goals should the election result in a ""Yes"" victory; namely giving citizens access to more resources when it comes to transportation options and cracking down hard on criminals. 

He believes the only way for real progress to be made is through collaboration and compromise – something which has proven difficult given the deeply entrenched differences between the two primary camps involved here. Nevertheless, Mallon remains undeterred and insists that any solution must involve every single party coming together and finding common ground. 

Of course, not everyone shares Mallon's optimistic view point – some see his involvement in this matter simply as another ploy meant to further strengthen the “Yes” side's chances of success. After spending years fighting against corruption within our government, Mallon has earned himself quite the reputation as well as plenty of criticism due to his controversial approach towards enforcing justice. 

Only time will tell whether or not he'll manage to bridge this gap between the various factions involved while still achieving positive results. But there can be little doubt that either way, Robert Mallon will undoubtedly leave his mark upon the future of our region regardless of how the upcoming ballot ends up turning out.

"News Article Title: Security Papers Found In Street During Pakistan's Presidential Visit To Britain 

    In what has been described as a potentially serious development, documents detailing security plans surrounding former Pakistani President Gen Pervez Musharraf’s recent visit to London have reportedly been located on the streets. The files – which include personal data and confidential information pertaining to the trip - were discovered on Friday afternoon by a citizen in Westminster. Police investigations into their origin remain ongoing at this time; however, an official from Scotland Yard confirmed that there was no immediate cause for concern regarding the security of Prime Minister Tony Blair’s guest or any other individuals attending his meeting with Musharraf. This follows reports last week of heightened international tension between India and Pakistan, following the latter country’s launch of ballistic missiles towards Indian-controlled Kashmir. While officials in both nations have yet to confirm whether either state is responsible for launching such weapons, many analysts believe that it may represent a significant escalation in tensions between the two countries. On the domestic front, British authorities have expressed outrage over the potential breach of privacy involved in disclosing private visitor records without consent. With so much uncertainty currently prevailing across the world stage, experts warn that citizens should remain vigilant against possible attempts to undermine national security, whilst also calling for greater cooperation among nation states to address existing threats posed by terrorism and extremism.

"George Galloway, former Member of Parliament (MP) and leader of the Respect Party, is pleading for the safe return of humanitarian aid worker Margaret Hassan. The 59-year old woman, who headed up international relief efforts in Iraq, disappeared while working there last week. 

Mr. Galloway had been a vocal critic of the UK’s involvement in the Iraq War, both before and after it began. In September 2006, he made headlines around the world when he became one of the first MPs to publicly call for its withdrawal. As head of the Respect Party, he continued to speak out against what he saw as the wrongful imposition of western power over nations across the Middle East. 

The Iraqi government condemned the kidnapping of Mrs Hassan, noting she was merely carrying out her duties as part of a team providing vital assistance to vulnerable Iraqis caught in the crossfire of regional conflict. They called for her immediate release and vowed to take action to ensure such abuse does not occur again.

Mrs Hassan's abduction has sparked widespread sympathy among people worldwide. Many are calling for governments to do more to protect those engaged in humanitarian work abroad and to hold accountable those responsible for violence towards civilians. It is also being seen as a reminder of the danger faced by many workers across the globe – including those working in fragile or conflict affected settings - due to ongoing political instability and military intervention. 

At the same time, some have questioned whether Mr Galloway’s own outspoken views have played any role in his excommunication from the British Labour Party, which came following his calls for its members to resist militarisation and support for the Iraqi resistance movement. While it remains to be seen if his appeal will be heard, many are hopeful that the high levels of attention generated by this case might help bring about much needed reforms to global policies on the use of force.

"The Liberal Democrats have highlighted the growing threat of problem debt among certain demographics, such as those living on lower incomes. In their latest effort to address this pressing matter, they are calling for an increase in protections against aggressive bank promotions targeting financially-vulnerable individuals. 
In a statement released today, Vince Cable, the current Member of Parliament (MP) representing the constituency, expressed concern over the increasing levels of household debt across Great Britain's nine largest cities. According to his calculations, nearly 8% of all families nationwide are currently struggling with excessive debt burdens, which he believes could reach alarming proportions if interest rates rise further or more job losses occur.
With these troubling figures firmly in mind, Cable has outlined specific proposals within the party manifesto ahead of next year’s general election. His primary goal involves providing enhanced safeguards for people who find themselves trapped under spiraling personal debt due to irresponsible lending practices by various banks. By implementing measures that ensure responsible lending, including stricter regulations and increased transparency, he aims to mitigate the risk faced by individuals seeking affordable loans while simultaneously protecting lenders' interests.
Cable also intends to establish comprehensive support systems specifically designed to assist indebted citizens. Drawing inspiration from successful initiatives implemented overseas, he plans to introduce dedicated helplines staffed by knowledgeable professionals trained to guide troubled borrowers towards suitable solutions tailored to their unique circumstances. These services would not only provide valuable advice but also connect them with reputable credit counseling agencies capable of assisting with budgeting assistance and negotiation strategies to alleviate outstanding balances. Additionally, he envisions collaborating closely with local authorities to develop neighborhood-based programs offering free debt management workshops, aiming to equip residents with essential knowledge regarding prudent money handling practices and effective debt repayment techniques.
To complement these efforts, the Lib Dem MP emphasizes the importance of fostering a culture of fiscal responsibility throughout society, especially during periods when economic stability hangs precariously. This includes encouraging educational campaigns targeted toward students and young adults, equipping them with crucial life skills necessary to make informed decisions about borrowing and managing finances responsibly. Moreover, he suggests incentivizing employers through tax breaks to promote flexible working arrangements that reduce employees' reliance on high-interest loans, thereby minimizing potential pitfalls stemming from mounting debt loads.
While acknowledging the delicate nature of striking the right balance between consumer rights and ensuring access to much-needed funds, the Lib Dem spokesperson remains resolute in pursuing policies aimed at safeguarding citizens' financial well-being. By advocating for fair and transparent banking practices coupled with robust social safety nets and accessible resources, he hopes to foster an environment where individuals can confidently navigate their way out of precarious financial situations without fear of being taken advantage of.
Overall, the Lib Dems' call for heightened awareness surrounding problem debt represents a significant step forward in addressing what has become a critical societal issue. With concerted efforts directed both at regulatory reform and public education, it is hoped that future generations will no longer fall victim to exploitative lending practices, ultimately leading to healthier, more prosperous communities across the country.

"The world of politics is always changing. In today's ever-changing political landscape, it can be difficult to keep up with all the latest happenings. From new policies being announced by governments around the globe, to elections taking place in various countries, there is no shortage of events that shape our collective future. 

In this blog post, we'll take an in depth look at some of the most recent developments in international politics. We'll examine how different nations are addressing issues such as climate change, the growing divide between rich and poor, and the rise of populism in many parts of Europe. We'll also explore the ongoing tensions between major powers like China and Russia, and consider what this means for global stability going forward. 

One of the biggest stories making headlines right now is the upcoming United States presidential election. With just over two months until Election Day, both Democratic and Republican candidates have been busy campaigning across the country. This year's race is shaping up to be one of the closest and most contentious in decades, pitting incumbent President Donald Trump against former Vice President Joe Biden. 

Another key issue dominating the political scene is Brexit negotiations. After nearly four years of uncertainty, Britain officially left the European Union earlier this month. Now, leaders from both sides must work out details related to trade, immigration, security and more before they formally part ways later this year. It remains to be seen whether the UK and EU will reach a deal by their planned October 31st deadline.

Meanwhile, several other countries are facing significant challenges including North Korea nuclear weapons testing and Iran's regional influence. Both countries' actions have prompted strong reactions from multiple nations around the world which could potentially spark further conflict if not addressed soon.

On a domestic level, many developed democracies are struggling with economic inequality and slow growth despite low unemployment rates. Some experts believe this trend may lead towards increased social unrest if steps aren't taken quickly enough – especially given recent protests in places like France and Greece.

Overall, the state of international affairs currently seems uncertain but hopeful due in large part to advancements made through technology such as artificial intelligence & blockchain. These innovations offer great potential for improving governance structures while reducing corruption within developing states where citizens lack access to basic resources like clean water & healthcare services needed to thrive economically & socially.""

"News Article: Politics
Patricia Hewitt, British politician and current Member of Parliament (MP) for Central Ayrshire, had strong views on Tuesday regarding political matters. She voiced her criticism against the “career sexism” which is present in politics today. According to Mrs. Hewitt this results in women's ambitions not coming into fruition as easily due to the lack of opportunities given them. This issue must be addressed if we want our society to progress and prosper according to its true potential. 

Mrs. Hewitt went on to say that she strongly believes that plans aimed at extending paid maternity leave need to become more of a focal point when campaigning during elections in order to promote equality between genders. These measures would have positive impacts both for mothers returning from taking time off work to care for their children as well as for businesses and employees in general. The additional financial burden such initiatives may impose can already be seen by looking at how expensive childcare costs are in Britain. Therefore, it needs to become much lower than what they currently are before there will be any meaningful change made. 

To ensure further success, it is essential that all parties involved take responsibility and commit themselves to making sure equal rights are granted equally among men and women in the workplace. In addition to that employers need to make sure they do provide enough support systems in place to enable working parents to achieve balance within their jobs while also caring for family members. Only then, can the real benefit be reaped from providing extended periods of parental leave. 

Therefore, it is clear that although steps have been taken towards greater gender equality in recent years; much still remains to be done in terms of promoting equal pay and creating fairer recruitment processes. By doing so, we could create better living standards throughout society while simultaneously giving everyone access to the same quality of life regardless of sex or social status.

Despite this, the leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, has been working hard to try and bring the different elements of the party together. He has been actively meeting with leaders from both the left and the right of the aisle, trying to find common ground and develop strategies for the future. One particular area he has focused on is the development of a new economic strategy which he believes will help reduce inequality and create more opportunities for everyone.

"Researchers fear that newly appointed British Secretary of State for Education, Ruth Kelly, may jeopardize crucial scientific advancement due to her religious beliefs. It has been disclosed by sources close to Mrs.Kelly that she holds anti-abortion stances and is against embryonic experimentation, which are key components in medical development. Experts from the UK's most prominent science council, the Medical Research Council (MRC) voiced their concern on Sunday night - asserting that Mrs. Kelly's opinions hold weight considering her role in shaping the country’s educational policies. They also stressed the importance of ensuring a diverse range of ideologies represented among policymakers given their direct influence on young minds preparing them to enter the field. 

  In response to this controversy surrounding Ms Kelly’s potential interference in the work conducted at MRC labs, the organization remains noncommittal.

"The Scots have finally heard good news. After years of debate, the Scottish Government is taking action against tobacco use and putting an end to the deadly habit for once and for all. In what some are calling a historic move, officials from across Scotland have come together to formally announce detailed plans on how they intend to make their nation smoke free. 

First Minister Jack McConnell has made it clear that this policy is one of his top priorities, saying that he wants to see the number of people affected by smoking drastically reduced as soon as possible. This comes after years of high levels of consumption in the country, with nearly 85% of adults admitting to having tried cigarettes at some point in their lives. The effects of this can be seen everywhere, from increased healthcare costs to higher levels of air pollution. 

In addition to making public spaces smoke free, the government is also cracking down on the illegal trade in tobacco products. They are investing more money in enforcement efforts, ensuring that those who violate the new laws face stiffer penalties than ever before. The hope is that this will act as a strong deterrent to potential criminals, helping to reduce demand for illicit goods.

The introduction of such a sweeping change does not come without its critics though. Some have argued that it goes too far, going so far as to say that it infringes upon personal freedoms. However, First Minister McConnell insists that this decision was not taken lightly and that the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks. Not only will this help to protect citizens' health, but it should also lead to economic savings due to less spending on treating smoking related illnesses.

There are also concerns over where smokers will go if they are banned from indoor venues. To address this issue, the government has announced the creation of special smoking zones outside restaurants and bars. These will provide a designated area for anyone wishing to indulge in nicotine cravings away from non-smokers. 

Overall, the response to the announcement from many has been positive. It seems likely that the majority of Scots back this initiative wholeheartedly, recognising that such a drastic measure could potentially save countless numbers of lives. With proper implementation, there is no doubt that Scotland could become a much healthier place to live thanks to this important step forward. 
A: Despite widespread criticism, the Scottish Government remains confident that implementing stricter regulations on smoking will ultimately benefit the population's overall well-being. By banning smoking indoors and creating outdoor smoking areas, the aim is to protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke while providing space for individuals to satisfy their nicotine addiction. Additionally, authorities plan to crack down on illegal trading of tobacco products in order to further curb usage. While there may still be pushback from certain groups regarding perceived violations of individual freedom, supporters argue that these measures are necessary to combat rising health care expenses associated with smoking-related illnesses. As Scotland prepares to embark on this ambitious journey towards becoming fully smoke-free, it is hoped that other nations will follow suit in prioritizing public health above commercial interests.

"Support for a hunt bans appears to be waning in the United Kingdom (UK), according to a recent nationwide poll. In 2019, only 48% of participants expressed any form of support for such legislation, down from 63% in 2013 and 67% in 2009. The trend also extends to public opinion against the measure, as 22% of respondents declared themselves to be “strongly” opposed to it, an increase from 19%. Moreover, approximately 1 in 6 individuals showed no interest either way. These findings were published by research firm MORI on Thursday. 

Although some have argued that such surveys are unreliable due to their small sample sizes, the results point towards a notable shift in political attitudes within the country. To put things into perspective, back in 1999 less than 50 percent supported a ban – meaning more than half were still firmly against the idea at that time. Thus, it seems the debate between hunters and animal rights activists has grown increasingly complex over the last decade or so.",phi2,1
"MPs issued with BlackBerry threat – MPs who have been caught using BlackBerry smartphones during debates in Parliament could face serious consequences. An investigation by Prime Minister's Office (PMO) discovered that several Members of Parliament, including high ranking ministers and senior officials, were found guilty of breaking House rules regarding electronic devices on the floor of the House of Commons. The PMO said it is considering disciplinary action against those found to have breached parliamentary protocols. This comes amid growing controversy over the widespread use of personal gadgets such as iPhones, iPads, and BlackBerry devices in government institutions across Britain. Many politicians argue that these technologies enable them to keep up with fast changing events while serving the needs of constituents faster. However, critics claim that the increasing dependence on technology for communication makes parliamentarians more vulnerable to security risks, privacy violations, and cyberbullying from malicious actors within political parties and interest groups. 

The issue was further compounded recently when Alastair Campbell, former Downing Street Chief of Staff to British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, sent out what appeared to be a vulgar text message to BBC Radio 4’s “Newsnight Review” program hosted by Peter Snow. In the recorded conversation between Campbell and Snookey, the former aide allegedly muttered two obscenities before quickly hanging up without explanation. Despite claims he did not mean for the messages to go through, the incident highlighted how easy it can be for mobile phones—even ones owned by public figures—to expose users to unintended audiences due to insufficient security measures. 

This development brings into question whether MPs should continue to bring such items into the Chamber of the House of Commons where they may cause disruptions and undermine respectability. It also raises important questions around accountability and responsibility among lawmakers for their actions, both online and offline. If given the chance to comment, many members of the UK’s current legislature would likely reiterate their commitment to upholding the highest standards of integrity and propriety; however, only time will tell whether stricter policies are necessary to ensure compliance with the laws governing behaviour at Westminster.

"The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, rejected allegations that he had been ‘leant on’ by Downing Street in order to make the legal arguments which led to the UK's invasion of Iraq.
 
Lord Goldsmith made it clear that he did not receive any assistance from Prime Minister Tony Blair or other Whitehall officials when formulating the government’s position prior to going to court over the 2003 decision. He also stated that a written response produced at an early stage of the litigation process and claiming that his own views had been influenced by Downing Street officials is completely untrue. In fact, Lord Goldsmith asserted that the document was solely composed by himself as part of his personal opinion. 

At this time of political tension, the British public are increasingly divided concerning their support for the ongoing conflict. Despite many questioning whether Britain should have gone ahead with its mission without consulting the courts first, there remains a substantial majority who believe the action taken was necessary in order to protect national security and prevent further terrorist attacks within Europe. Furthermore, some argue that if Saddam Hussein had continued with weapons programs involving chemical, biological or nuclear substances then Britain may well be facing even more dangerous threats now than before - thus making the military intervention all the more crucial in safeguarding citizens around the world.

"The UK's youth population is increasingly taking an interest in political matters, as evidenced by new research from the Electoral Commission. 

A poll of 16 to 20 year olds revealed that 81% of individuals in this age group reported having a strong opinion on various issues such as crime and education policy. Moreover, over half of those surveyed showed a willingness to participate in direct action to make their voices heard. These results are particularly significant considering the current state of the political landscape in the United Kingdom.


Consider four hypothetical countries A, B, C, D. Each country has different levels of voter turnout amongst its youthful demographic aged between 18 - 25 years old (Youth). We know that: 
1) Country B has higher Youth Voter Turnout than Country D but lower than Country A.
2) Amongst the top three Countries with highest Youth voters' turnout; one ranks second and another rank third while remaining unknown which ranks first among them all.
3) Only two out of four given information can be true at once due to data limitations.
4) One of these countries did not reach 30%, 40%, or 50%. None reached more than 60%. 
5) In every single case, no two countries had the same percentage of Youth votes cast.
6) If Country D’s Youth Voter turnout was less than 40%, then either Country A or Country E would surpass it when comparing both of them together.
7) Either Country B surpassed both Country A and C combined or none of them passed each other except for one point.  
8) It is known that the sum of percentages of Country A and C cannot exceed 70%.
9) No Country exceeded 45%.   
10) At least one Country has 35% Youth vote.
11) Country A did not surpass 40%.  
12) There were only two countries where no matter what order they came in there never could have been a tie for any position above 15th place.

Question: Can you identify the respective rankings, minimum and maximum possible values within 5 points, and actual values if available?


From clue 4 we infer that the lowest number achieved must be 10 because no country surpassed 100%. From Clue 9 and 11, we understand Country A couldn't exceed 44%. So, the numbers for Countries A and B range between 14 and 54 inclusive. As per Clue 12, since no pair can achieve positions 1 through 6, A & C must occupy places 7 or 8. Considering Clue 3, if A = 56 and C= 48, then B > 58 which violates clue 2 thus forcing A < 52 and hence, C>50. Hence, A=52 and C=46.

Since A=52 and B>D based on Clue1, and since D<40 according to Clue 2(from step1),B must equal 53 leaving D as 41. This fulfills our conditions. Now, let's use proof by exhaustion here. Since only two out of five clues hold up under exhaustive analysis, let's test whether B is ranked first or third (according to the rules) along with determining the final ranking using inductive logic. Let's assume B is in last position (third), therefore C must take the first spot (since rule #7 says B topped some others). But this contradicts rule#12 which states no pairs can get the top three spots in a row unless one gets first. Thus B should come before C i.e., fourth and consequently, A should go after C so it takes the fifth spot. Therefore, C is first, followed by A in sixth and finally comes D who took seventh position.

Answer: The countries ordered in descending order based on their youth voter turnout are: C, A, E, B, D. With respect to the range mentioned earlier, the lowest value achievable is 46% and the largest possible is 57%. Given the specific percentages, C=51%, A=44%, B=48%, and D=41%.

"Butcher, a former prime minister’s close confidant and long-time friend, today launched an scathing critique of former Prime Minister Tony Blair's legacy. 

Butler claimed that during his time in Downing Street, Blair’s administration prioritized sensationalist journalism over responsible decision making. “The British press is obsessed with clicks and views, rather than informing citizens accurately,"" he stated. “Blair saw this as nothing more than political capital, using media attention for short term gains instead of focusing on longer term solutions.” 

He went further to accuse Blair of misleading Parliament and the nation throughout his tenure. From failing to acknowledge potential risks before going into the Iraq War, to ignoring warnings from within the military regarding the strength of weapons posed by Iraqi forces - Blair consistently put his own agenda ahead of sound judgement.

Despite his comments, Labour Party leaders have defended Blair's record. Stephen Byers, formerly Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and now Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, argued that Blair made difficult decisions while facing immense pressure. But Butler countered that there were always alternative courses of action which would not have resulted in such tragic consequences.

"1. Protect whistleblowers : The new report by TUC claims that whistleblower protections must be expanded in order for workers to safely voice their concerns related to workplace safety issues (Tuc). 
2. Government changes laws : In line with this recommendation of the union federation, there is an urgent need for governments at all levels to make necessary amendments on existing legislation that protect whistle-blowers (Government). This includes strengthening regulations pertaining to disclosure and investigation processes (Whistleblower Protection Act), as well as providing greater security for those speaking out against unsafe practices (Employment Tribunal Law Reform Bill). 
3. Safety Whistle-blowing : According to recent reports released by the Employment Tribunals Office, nearly 1500 ‘safety whistleblowers’ have been terminated over the past twenty years due to raising legitimate grievances concerning hazardous work environments within their companies (Safety Whistle-blowing Report 2019 ). Such incidents are indicative of a wider trend towards employers attempting to avoid liability through termination instead of rectifying underlying issues (Corporate Accountability Index 2018 ).
4. Firms opting for dismissal rather than improvement : Despite evidence indicating increased risks associated with noncompliance, many businesses choose to ignore potential violations rather than take corrective measures such as investing into better infrastructure or changing policies regarding employee safety standards – leaving individuals exposed to serious hazards without recourse (Occupational Health & Safety Administration 2020 ). This behaviour demonstrates how organizations continue disregarding legal obligations while putting profit ahead of people’s wellbeing.
5. Needed improvements : Given this context, it becomes essential for authorities across industries including healthcare, construction, manufacturing, retail, hospitality etc. to prioritize implementing robust mechanisms which ensure compliance among staff members while also safeguarding them from any retribution whatsoever if they do speak up when confronted with unacceptable situations ; otherwise risk facing dire consequences like losing livelihood opportunities altogether (Workplace Ombudsman 2021 ).",phi2,1

"Charles Clarke, the former Home Secretary and current Prime Minister of Britain, is set to continue pressing ahead with plans to introduce national identity cards. Despite calls by some politicians for an immediate halt in their implementation, Mr Clarke remains committed to seeing through his party's policy on this issue. 

The decision has been met with mixed reactions across political circles. Some supporters of the government's stance argue that ID cards will help protect citizens against terrorism and other forms of crime. They claim that having access to accurate information regarding someone's identity would make it much harder for criminals or terrorists to operate without being identified. Additionally, they suggest the cards could serve as an effective tool in reducing fraud and increasing security within both public and private sectors. 

On the other hand, critics are more cautious in their assessment of the plan. Many opponents have voiced concerns over privacy issues arising from the introduction of such an extensive system. They worry that personal data gathered during registration may be misused or abused - raising serious questions around civil liberties and individual freedoms. Furthermore, there have been fears raised concerning how those who cannot afford to obtain identification documents (such as immigrants and refugees) might feel disenfranchised or even further marginalized if forced into obtaining one. 

Despite the controversy surrounding ID card schemes, Charles Clarke has maintained his commitment towards implementing them. In fact, following the recent resignation of his predecessor, David Blunkett, Clarke has used the changeover in leadership as an opportune moment to re-examine the necessity of introducing the scheme. He has stated that although he supports the principle behind the idea, he wishes to explore all possible alternatives before making any final decisions. This move appears to signal a willingness to listen to opposing views while still maintaining a firm focus upon achieving his ultimate goal of nationwide identification. 


Consider a hypothetical situation where the National Identity Card Scheme (NICS) is implemented under four conditions. These are:
1. If Charles Clarke supports the NICS then the Labour Party also approves it.
2. Either Charles Clarke opposes the NICS or the Conservative Party does not approve it but both do support Blair's policies.
3. If Blair's approval increases the chances of the scheme passing Parliament than only Labour and the Conservatives' approval matter. However, if neither of these two parties supports the scheme, its passage becomes doubtful regardless of the majority votes from MPs. 
4. If at least 70% of MPs support the scheme, it gets passed. Otherwise, it doesn't pass no matter what percentage of members of either party agree with its enactment.

Now let us assume the above mentioned statements hold true given the circumstances detailed in the previous paragraphs; Charles Clarke indeed continues with the NICS plans despite pressure to reconsider. Given this new development, answer the following questions using logical deductions:
Question: What can we say about the potential outcome of NICS? Who among the three main parties (Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats), if any, must now oppose it based on our assumptions so far?


From Statement 4, since the minimum requirement for passage is 70%, and assuming all major parties have already expressed their opinions, if less than 70% of MPs were willing to vote in favor of the bill, even though every single major party except one supports the measure, it wouldn’t get passed. Therefore, at least 3/10th of the total number of MPs should disagree with the proposal otherwise it won’t succeed. We know that all three parties support Blair’s policies which gives each of them equal weightage in terms of supporting the Bill because of statement 2. Hence, if none of these three parties disagrees (which contradicts statement 1 and 2), it means at most 10 out of 100 parliamentarians would disapprove of the Bill leading up to its voting process thus ensuring failure according to rule 4. Consequently, if we consider statement 3, since neither Labour nor the Conservatives' support matters after Blair's support due to his high influence factor. So, if any of the other minor parties like the Liberals oppose Blair's approach, it shouldn't impact the fate of the Bill negatively since it would need a higher threshold to fail. Thus, based on the assumption that all parties support Blair's policies including the opposition ones and considering that the required majority for success is 7 out of 10, at least 2 opposition leaders or parties must now officially voice disapproval of NICS if it passes through parliamentary procedures.

"In a recent interview, Former Immigration Minister, Baroness Shami Chakrabarti, has argued that the United Kingdom requires more accurate information on its immigration levels. Barraroche believes that the current system relies too heavily on numbers provided by the government, which she argues are unreliable due to their tendency to underreport migrants entering from other European Union countries. To address this issue, Chakrabarti has proposed the establishment of an independent oversight board to monitor and regulate migration flows in accordance with international law. 

The board would consist of experts with knowledge of economics, sociology, and political science who could provide unbiased assessments of immigration policy's effects. This new body would have access to comprehensive datasets on migrant arrivals and departures; labour market statistics; population demographics; public opinion surveys; and economic indicators such as GDP growth rates. It will also include members chosen from civil society organizations representing ethnic minorities or refugees. The goal is to create transparency around the process while maintaining respect for human rights standards throughout the country. 

Critics argue that establishing an oversight group would require substantial financial resources that may strain budgets already stretched thin due to Brexit-related costs associated with leaving the EU Customs union and single market—a cost estimated at £39 billion per year. In addition, some fear that creating another bureaucracy within government might slow down decision-making processes related to managing national security matters or responding quickly enough during humanitarian crises when every second counts. Nonetheless, others say that without greater understanding of the impact of various forms of immigration on both local communities and nation states alike there can't be meaningful debate over how best to handle any potential influxes in future years – whether caused by refugees fleeing war zones abroad or skilled professionals seeking better employment opportunities elsewhere.

"In a new report published today (Thursday), the Electoral Commission has called for debates around whether or not there should be a cap on donations made to political parties. Election experts and politicians have long been arguing about the influence of money in politics, with some believing that large contributions from wealthy individuals and corporations could lead to corrupt practices and an imbalance of power. However, the Electoral Commission has raised concerns that introducing such a measure too soon may do more harm than good, as it would potentially infringe upon freedom of speech and reduce public trust in democratic institutions. 

The commission's findings echo those of other independent organisations who have studied the issue. For example, last year, former Prime Minister David Cameron commissioned an inquiry into electoral finance which concluded that while ""there were issues associated with the role of cash in UK democracy"", introducing strict limits was not necessary at this stage given the current state of party funding laws. Instead, the commission suggests that further education and regulation might be required before any decisions are taken regarding a potential donation cap.

"David Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, made headlines today when he issued an apology to members of parliament (MPs) following his department's announcement that it had been reviewing manslaughter legislation. In the announcement, which came through a press release on Monday evening, the Home Office acknowledged that the original review - intended to take place later this year - had instead been brought forward due to recommendations from the Law Commissions' report into criminal offences. This move was met by condemnation from some politicians who criticised Blunkett for making such decisions without consulting them first. 

The decision to launch the new review comes amidst widespread dissatisfaction with the UK legal system and its failure to provide fair outcomes for victims' families. For many years now crime rates have continued to rise; according to recent figures released by the British Crime Survey more than nine million people reported being victims of a violent crime in 2012/13 alone. While there is undoubtedly pressure to do something quickly, critics argue that hastily implemented changes could end up doing more harm than good. 

So far Blunkett's government has sought to make minor adjustments to the law in an attempt to address public concerns but those measures have failed to satisfy everyone. One area where particular attention needs to be paid is the issue of sentencing. Many feel that too often offenders receive sentences that are lenient given the severity of their crimes while others call for tougher penalties for those convicted of serious offenses. Meanwhile the introduction of new guidelines designed to reduce re-offending levels has also come under scrutiny, with questions raised about whether they will actually achieve their goal or simply create additional bureaucracy. 

In light of all this, Blunkett's promise to review the existing manslaughter laws marks one positive step towards ensuring justice prevails in Britain. However, only time will tell if such reforms truly result in improved outcomes for both criminals and victims. Until then, much work remains to be done before we can say with any certainty whether the United Kingdom's legal system is fit for purpose.

However, after careful consideration and consultation with senior members of the legal team representing him, McLeitche insists that they are satisfied there are no issues regarding this matter.

"The European Union's (EU) embargo on arms exports to China will soon come to an end, according to United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. Despite efforts from the United States to maintain the ban, it is unlikely that the restriction will remain in place for another year or more. This comes amid reports that the Chinese government has been looking into purchasing weapons from other countries, such as Russia and North Korea. 

Jack Straw warned Wednesday that despite his attempts to keep the embargo in place, there were still numerous human rights issues in China which needed to be addressed. He went on to say that it was wrong to rely solely on sanctions to pressure the Chinese government into making positive changes, and added that the EU should focus on engaging directly with Beijing. 

Despite the controversy surrounding the potential lifting of the arms trade embargo, many in the EU are hopeful that this could lead to greater diplomatic relations between Europe and Asia. It remains to be seen whether the decision will ultimately benefit both parties; however, one thing is certain: the future of the EU–China relationship looks increasingly uncertain.",phi2,1

"The UK's Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has announced that he will be standing down as Chancellor of the Exchequer after just two years in office. This is despite previously promising to serve only one term if elected - making this announcement all but certain at the beginning of his tenure. 

Brown was praised during his time in charge for introducing several successful policies including tax cuts, investment in public services such as education, and measures to promote economic growth. He also took swift action to help the country through the global financial crisis in 2008, implementing an ambitious stimulus package which helped prevent the worst consequences of the downturn.

"The UK is taking its civics and education seriously by introducing special events to recognise when citizens reach 18 years old. The announcement was made by Minister of State for Culture, Communications, and Creative Industries, Charles Clarke, during his time at a parliamentary debate. An additional 12 months of grants have been provided by the Department for Education to local authorities so they can run programs focused on civic awareness and understanding.

Charles Clarke went on to say that this initiative should be seen “as part of an overhaul of how our government engages with what we like to call 'inclusive citizenship'"". This involves raising awareness of all citizens’ rights and responsibilities, regardless of ethnicity, gender or age.

The new programmes will focus on educating the public in regards to democracy, justice and human rights. They aim to empower citizens to become active participants in society by providing insight into their roles in shaping policy and decision-making processes. These activities include community organising, participating in debates and campaigns, and volunteering. 

The British government has also decided to introduce commemorative ceremonies to acknowledge the transition from childhood to adulthood. The launch of the Australian model in Oxfordshire will mark the first phase of these celebrations. Other areas will soon follow suit and offer similar ceremonies for turning 18. 

These ceremonies will be integral in promoting civic engagement among young adults and encourage them to develop meaningful connections with their communities. By offering recognition and celebration of this important milestone, the government hopes to cultivate an environment where everyone feels valued and included in society.

"Artists and art critics have expressed concern today as the Arts Council of Wales appears set for takeover by Welsh Premier, Rhodri Morgan's, government. The controversy centers around an ongoing debate concerning the distribution of funds allocated towards cultural programs within Wales. 

    Rhodri Morgan, leader of the Labour Party, announced this week his plans to take control of the council through legislation which will see power transferred from Westminster-based bureaucrats to local councils. This move was met with immediate backlash from some members of the Welsh public who fear that their voices could become muted if decisions regarding culture were made at a local level rather than on a national scale. 

    Critics argue that giving more powers to regional authorities risks creating divisions between different parts of the country; they also question whether there are enough safeguards in place against any one region having too much influence when making budgetary decisions affecting everyone else’s work. 

    Supporters counter that increased autonomy for individual areas means better tailored support systems can be developed according to each area ‘ s needs – something currently lacking due to lacklustre central oversight from London based officials who don't fully understand what goes on down here.""""""

Tony Blair strode through the tranquil waters of Waverley Creek during an excursion alongside Minister for Education, Ruth Kelly. Their mission was aimed at promoting educational trips among young people by demonstrating their own commitment to such activities. Mr Blair subsequently emphasized the significance of the upcoming elections, emphasizing that the Labor Party's platform is centered around enhancing learning experiences within schools. 
During this outing, Mr Blair expressed how vital it would be for pupils to explore nature in a safe environment, highlighting the need for more resources being devoted towards achieving that objective.

"The political landscape in Britain is currently dominated by two major parties, Labour and Conservative. With the upcoming budget set for next month, the atmosphere of tension between them is palpable. 

Both sides are gearing up for a tough battle over the allocation of resources, with each side trying to gain an advantage from the other’s weaknesses. The Conservative party is strong on economy and health care policies, while the Labour party has been gaining ground on social issues such as welfare reforms and climate change.

The prime minister, David Cameron, has proposed several cuts across different sectors to reduce government spending. This has led to widespread criticism within the Labour party, who argue that the measures are too harsh and could have severe consequences for many citizens. 

David Miliband, the Labour leader, has called for more investment in public services and infrastructure, arguing that this could create jobs and boost the economy in the long run. However, Prime Minister Cameron remains adamant that any new spending must be done responsibly and sustainably.

The future of British politics looks uncertain, with both sides firmly entrenched in their respective positions. It remains to be seen how the budget will shape the coming months, and what kind of impact it will have on the lives of Britons. Response: The UK's current political situation is one of great divide between the Labor Party and the Conservatives. Both parties are heavily competing against each other using various strategies, from making bold promises to cutting crucial programs when necessary. 

Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed multiple policy changes, which have sparked immense controversy throughout the country. These actions have caused much tension between the two parties, especially during the upcoming budget period.

The main point of contention between the two parties is government spending. While the Conservatives support reducing government expenditures, Labor argues that such decisions could lead to adverse effects on citizens. Moreover, the latter emphasizes the importance of investing in public services and infrastructure, claiming that this would benefit the economy in the long term.

The upcoming budget holds significant implications for the British political scene. Many expect that many key provisions in the budget will revolve around trade agreements, such as Brexit negotiations. Additionally, experts think that the budget may include tax breaks or stimulus packages aimed at boosting growth.

"Tony Blair congratulated President George W. Bush yesterday on an election victory which will extend the conservative administration's dominance of American politics into its second term in office. The former British Prime Minister, who is no stranger to US foreign policy, expressed appreciation for the work done by Mr. Bush thus far during their first five years together, calling it “tremendously effective”. 

In addition to this congratulatory call from Tony Blair, the two leaders have also indicated they look forward to maintaining their close partnership going forward, despite political differences between the countries. Mr. Bush acknowledged Britain’s contribution to global stability over the past 15 years while expressing confidence in both nations' ability to solve pressing issues through mutual understanding.

At present, there are several key areas where collaboration between America and Great Britain could prove fruitful. One such area is counter-terrorism efforts. Both leaders have emphasized their commitment towards combating terrorism around the world, pledging to share intelligence resources, enhance security cooperation and implement joint initiatives against extremist groups. By joining forces in this regard, the hope is to disrupt terrorist networks more effectively and ensure greater regional peace and safety.


Here comes another challenge based on what we just discussed - let's imagine you're part of the United Nations Security Council discussing international security measures after reading this conversation between Tony Blair and George Bush. You need to propose three concrete actions for each country (America, Britain) considering the points mentioned above.

Question 1: If you choose one issue out of counter-terrorism, economic relations, or climate change, what should your proposal include? What would be possible responses from America and Britain respectively? 
  
   
Answer 1: Given our discussion, a suitable topic might revolve around counter-terrorism since both leaders highlighted its importance. A proposed action could be enhancing intelligence sharing agreements and establishing a joint task force focusing specifically on disrupting extremist activities. A response from America may involve agreement but also emphasizing individual nation capabilities within counterterrorism strategies given different domestic situations. For Britain, a potential comment might center on how bilateral partnerships can serve as models globally promoting unity amidst diversity.

   
   
Question 2: How about proposing two other topics if not countering terrorism? Again keeping national interests in mind.

   Answer 2: Another feasible option could be strengthening trade relationships due to previous discussions regarding shared prosperity. In terms of climate change, both sides could focus on implementing ambitious emission reduction targets and increasing renewable energy investments as part of the Paris Agreement commitments. An expected reaction from America might entail praise acknowledging the UK leadership in environmental policies, whereas Britain may express satisfaction over continued alignment on critical global challenges.

"The rewards of leaving front bench politics have been revealed in the recently released Annual Register of Members’ Interests. Former Conservative Leader William Hague has earned over £800,000 on top of his MP's salary for giving lectures and appearing on television since resigning as Party Chairman in 2013. This is, according to the report, nearly seven times more than he was paid when he left office earlier this year.

Former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Michael Portillo also continues to reap the benefits of backbench life, according to the documents. It is reported that he earns up to £500,000 per annum – mainly due to his services to the public sector. He will continue to receive this income even though he no longer holds an elected position in parliament.

This latest revelation raises questions about the ethics of politicians staying active after their time in government has ended. It seems clear that some individuals stand to gain significantly by continuing in political life, while others could be seen as unfairly profiting from positions they once held.

It remains to be seen how widespread this trend is across party lines, but one thing is certain: the current system appears to allow those who remain involved in politics to make significant financial gains from their experiences. Whether or not this practice should be regulated further is yet to be decided.

Despite widespread opposition from hunters' groups, Michael insisted that the law was necessary to protect animals from unnecessary suffering. He called it'very clear' and argued that anyone who chose to hunt illegally should be held accountable for their actions. 
The law will come into effect at midnight tonight (Monday) following months of debate in parliament. Hunting with hounds had been permitted in some parts of England and Wales until recently but this changed when the Hunting Act 2004 was passed by both houses of parliament. This made it illegal for most activities involving hunting wild mammals such as badgers, deer, or hares. In addition, it also outlawed baiting, trapping, and other cruel practices associated with hunting. 
Michael said he understood there would be resistance to the new legislation but added it was necessary in order to ensure animal welfare standards are maintained. He went to further say that it was important to note that those found guilty of breaking the law could face fines up to £20 000 and even imprisonment. 
He concluded by saying he hoped the move would send out a strong message that any form of cruelty towards animals will not be tolerated. With that, the legalisation of hunting with hounds in the UK comes into effect tonight (Monday).

Howard called on the government to hold the heir apparent accountable for “deepening political divisions” caused during last year's royal wedding.

In a rare show of public support for the former prime minister, several senior Conservatives have backed him up – including Chancellor Sajid Javid, who suggested that the family should take responsibility for their own choices. The current Prime Minister, David Cameron, was less than impressed when told about the events at Windsor Castle from one of those close to the royal couple. He dismissed them as nothing more than “trivial” while refusing to say whether he himself felt differently. 


The Crown Office has now launched its investigation into allegations surrounding the incident involving the Duke of Sussex. However, due to ongoing negotiations between the royal family members involved, they are unable to comment publicly. This situation creates confusion among some British citizens - some believe the incident to be serious enough to warrant immediate punishment whilst others see this merely as another scandal adding fuel towards the already existing division within society.

As tensions rise between various factions across Europe following the announcement made by US President Donald Trump earlier today, leaders from both sides have come out strongly in defense or criticism against each respective stance.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel stated her belief that diplomacy and dialogue must remain the primary means through which nations can resolve disputes. She further emphasized the importance of maintaining trust amongst global partners, warning against any moves that could lead to escalating conflict. Meanwhile in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Trump's decision, accusing him of acting unilaterally without consulting allies. Macron argued that multilateralism is crucial in addressing pressing issues such as climate change and nuclear proliferation. Despite mounting international pressure, Trump defended his position, arguing that America has the right to pursue policies that benefit its interests first and foremost. In Washington D.C., Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned foreign powers not to interfere in domestic affairs, calling on all parties to exercise restraint and respect sovereignty. As the world waits with bated breath to hear from Russia, China, and Iran on Tuesday evening, experts caution that the coming days will likely bring even greater uncertainty as the stakes get higher.
User: Can you add more information about how different countries are responding to Trump's decision?
Assistant: Sure! Here's additional information added to the previous text:

Other Western democracies, including Canada and Japan, expressed concerns over Trump's move, citing potential negative consequences for global trade relations and stability. NATO member states have also spoken out against the decision, with German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen stating that the alliance stands ready to defend its members if necessary. Several Eastern European countries, meanwhile, praised Trump's action, viewing it as a sign of American strength and independence. In addition, Russian officials reacted cautiously to the development, acknowledging Trump's intention to put pressure on North Korea but expressing hope for peaceful resolution through talks rather than military confrontation. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the need for diplomacy and mutual understanding to address regional security challenges. Overall, the reaction to Trump's decision reflects the complex geopolitical landscape facing the international community as it grapples with rising threats posed by terrorism, populism, and authoritarian regimes.


Rules of the puzzle game:
1) Each country mentioned (US, EU, China, Russia) corresponds to either supporting, opposing, neutral or mixed views on Trump's decision. These positions cannot overlap; every country holds only one view per day.

"The British Prime Minister's office issued a statement in response to today's court ruling which found that detaining terrorist suspects outside of normal legal channels was illegal. 

Prime Minister Johnson stated, ""We have closely reviewed the findings of the Court of Appeal and we will be working hard to determine our next steps.""

Johnson went on to say that the British Government takes terrorism extremely seriously and committing crimes against humanity will not be tolerated. He stressed that the safety and security of all citizens is paramount and that the government will take action to ensure that justice is served. 

At this time, it remains unclear what specific actions the British Government plans to take in light of the court ruling. However, one thing is certain: the government will not stand idly by when it comes to protecting the public from terrorists. 

In addition to taking immediate steps to address the ruling, the government has also pledged to invest in new measures to combat terrorism more effectively. These include increasing intelligence gathering efforts, strengthening border controls, and improving international cooperation between law enforcement agencies. 

The Home Secretary, Priti Patel, commented on the issue saying, ""We are committed to doing everything within our power to keep Britain safe from those who seek to do us harm."" She further added that the government will continue to fight back against extremism both at home and abroad. 

The reaction from political parties across the spectrum was largely positive; Conservative leader Boris Johnson praised the decision as an important step forward in upholding fundamental democratic principles, while Labour leader Keir Starmer welcomed the move but cautioned that there is still much to be done in terms of tackling root causes of radicalization. 

Overall, the court ruling represents a major victory for civil liberties campaigners and sets an important precedent for future cases involving state surveillance powers. It serves as a reminder that governments can never assume they have absolute authority when dealing with issues related to national security – their every move will now need to comply with stringent judicial oversight standards set out under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA).

"Gordon Brown's three-point plan for a new era in British public policy has been met with enthusiasm and optimism. The plan, which focuses on strengthening community networks, investing in renewable energy sources, and promoting social and economic justice, is seen as a potential game-changer for the country.

One of the main components of Brown's plan is a focus on community networks. Under his proposals, local communities would be given more autonomy and control over decision making processes that affect them. This would give communities greater responsibility and a greater sense of ownership over their localities, leading to more effective governance and better quality of life. 

Another key element of the proposal is an increased investment in renewable energy sources. Brown plans to invest billions of pounds in developing solar, wind, and other forms of green technology, creating thousands of jobs in the process. His initiative aims to reduce Britain's dependence on expensive imported fuels, while also helping to combat climate change.

The final part of Brown's plan deals with social and economic justice. He proposes increasing the minimum wage, improving access to education and healthcare, and reforming welfare benefits to ensure they are fair and proportionate. These measures aim to promote equality and reduce poverty, allowing everyone in society to have the opportunity to succeed regardless of their background or circumstances.

Many are welcoming Brown's plan, seeing it as a much needed update to traditional political policies. As Prime Minister, Brown has long advocated for progressive policies such as those included here, so many believe he is well placed to make good on his promises. In addition, many see his proposals as having the potential to create real opportunities for all Britons, creating a brighter future and greater prosperity for us all. 

Despite some criticism from certain quarters, the consensus is that Gordon Brown's plan is a positive step forward for Britain. With its emphasis on community networks, clean energy, and social and economic justice, it offers a compelling vision of the kind of Britain we could and should aspire to become. By implementing these measures, Brown may just achieve his goal of setting out a clear path towards a brighter tomorrow for the entire nation.

This comes after a damning report from the House of Lords Select Committee which found that the agency had been largely ineffective in collecting child support payments since its inception in 1993. The same day, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that he was appointing Nick Clegg, MP to lead a government-wide review into social security reform. The findings of this review have yet to be made public. Despite these developments, Minister Alastair Darling insisted yesterday that the CSA would still remain open until at least 2015, adding that the Government were “absolutely committed” to ensuring that the agency met its targets. Furthermore, he went on to say that the Csa was an essential part of Britain’s welfare state, arguing that it provided vital support for vulnerable families across the country. However, given its current failings, many MPs have argued that the Csa should be shut down and replaced with a more effective system. In response, Mr. Johnson suggested that the agency might need to become a smaller organisation if it was to survive, suggesting that ministers would consider reducing staff numbers or closing some regional offices in order to save money. He added that any replacement scheme would likely involve greater use of technology, such as online payment systems, in order to reduce costs further. These proposals come against the backdrop of rising poverty levels among British citizens, who are struggling to make ends meet due to high living expenses and cuts to benefits.

"Incoming Tory leader, Michael Howard has outlined his party's policies for law enforcement in England and Wales. The Tories are proposing that local communities take part in the election of their own area police commissioners, aiming to abolish so-called 'unaccountable' police authorities. 
Under this new system, elected officials from each community will have the power to oversee the work of local police forces. According to Mr Howard, this is a vital step towards ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the police force. 
The proposal comes at a time when relations between the public and the police have been strained due to several high-profile cases involving unlawful use of authority by some officers. The Conservative Party aims to restore trust and confidence in the police through its reform package, which also includes plans for an independent crime commission and stricter penalties for offenders.
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats have attacked what they describe as a move by the Government to create more opportunities for extremist groups to operate within the country's law enforcement system. They argue that giving too much control over the appointment of local police commissioners may lead to the rise of radicalized individuals who do not share traditional values or respect basic human rights.
On the other hand, Labour leader Ed Milliband says the proposals put forward by the Conservative government could undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the British police service. The former Home Secretary warns that allowing unelected individuals like police commissioners to make decisions without adequate oversight risks politicising the police force. He argues that such a development could weaken the independence of the police and ultimately jeopardize national security interests.

"Successor to the Throne in Britain: Debate Heats Up Over New Proposals for Succession Law 
In a groundbreaking move, Labour Peer Lord Dubs has proposed new legislation that could potentially overhaul British monarchy's current system of hereditary rule. Dubs' proposal seeks to eliminate archaic practices which allow only male descendants from royal families to take precedence over female ones when it comes time to choose a future monarch. This marks a significant shift away from traditional beliefs and highlights the need for modernized laws within the United Kingdom’s constitutional framework.
The core argument behind this motion is to ensure greater gender equality by removing discriminatory language within the Act of Settlement 1701, which currently stipulates that males shall inherit thrones rather than females should there be no direct heir available – thus perpetuating a practice rooted in centuries-old patriarchal values. It further proposes an amendment to remove the provision prohibiting heirs to the throne from wedlock as well as abolishing all restrictions imposed upon them due to their religious affiliation or background. These changes would effectively open up possibilities never considered prior and represent monumental progress towards establishing true fairness throughout society.
Despite strong opposition from some members of the House of Lords who argue such reforms might disrupt established traditions and weaken cultural identity, many supporters remain optimistic that implementing such measures will help foster diversity & inclusion among those eligible to become rulers of England, Scotland & Wales. As one leading scholar put it: “This bill does not seek to undermine existing customs—rather, it seeks to evolve them in order to better reflect contemporary standards"".
Moreover, opponents of the bill claim its passage would set a dangerous precedent for other nations looking to reform outdated legislations related to inheritance rights; however, given growing pressure surrounding similar issues worldwide (including Canada s recent adoption of progressive amendments) we feel confident that our government can find suitable solutions while preserving fundamental principles associated with British culture.

"Article Title: Election Deal Falters Over Heath Role, Asking the Question: Can Politics Survive?

    The recent British General Elections have left many people wondering if their political system can survive. With so much focus on the two major parties vying for power and the various scandals that have come along with it, it seems like the trust in our political leaders has never been lower. 

From the start of the campaign until the final days of voting, the tension between the two main parties was palpable. Both sides were making bold promises and attacking the other's policies, while citizens were divided on who they should vote for. And when the results came out, the Conservatives had lost the majority they needed to stay in power. This resulted in a historic fall from grace for Prime Minister Theresa May. 

But there was another key player in this story—Sir Edward Heath. After winning the 1965 landslide victory which brought him to power, he became increasingly isolated within his party as well as facing growing dissent from outside sources. He attempted to maintain the support of both factions, but ultimately failed. In order to keep the peace in his party, he reluctantly stepped down as Party Chairman just before the 1974 elections. 

Unfortunately, the new documents revealed how little progress had been made since the last attempt at forming an alliance between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems under Harold Wilson in 1972. Despite talks and negotiation, no agreement could be reached due to issues surrounding John Major’s health. Although Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn called for Major to step aside, the issue remained unresolved – leading some to believe that the UK’s current political situation is only getting worse. 

With the election result showing clear divisions within society and the potential for more radicalisation of certain groups, there are fears that Britain may become even more politically unstable in the future. This, coupled with the fact that Brexit remains unsolved and the economy continues to struggle, makes it difficult to see any light ahead for the country. 

What is clear however, is that something needs to change. Whether that means finding a way to bridge the divide between the different parties, or ensuring that all voices are heard and respected in the decision-making process, the UK cannot remain static if it hopes to face its future head-on. Only time will tell what kind of politics England will have in the coming years.

"The UK's House of Commons is set to begin an investigation into senior government officials who have generated significant income in their personal capacity. Members of Parliament (MPs) will soon start questioning aides connected to the Duke of Lancaster and Duchess of Cornwall, who are responsible for managing the wealth of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip.
 
According to reports, ministers may inquire further regarding the recent spending activities related to Princess Anne-Charlotte, the wife of Prince William, as well as the expenditure associated with the controversial wedding dress worn by Camilla Parker Bowles when she married Prince Charles three years ago. The committee aims to scrutinize whether appropriate measures were taken during the procurement process of the dress, which reportedly cost around £40 million. In light of these inquiries, it seems evident that there might indeed be room for improvement or potential misuse of funds within both institutions.

"News Article Title: Blairs Unwavering Support Of Brown's Pre-Election Budget 

Prime Minister, Gordon Brown faced tough questions from opponents today as they criticised his ambitious vision of an economically strong United Kingdom. But Prime Minister Brown remained unwavering in his support of the chancellor’s pre-budget statement, claiming it strengthened national security and provided opportunities for growth and development.
The key focus of Brown’s announcement was on financial reforms designed to reduce government expenditure while ensuring services remain intact during difficult times. This measure had been met with widespread approval amongst economists, who praised its effectiveness at reducing fiscal deficits without cutting essential public resources.
In addition to this, Brown proposed measures to stimulate investment in renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind farms. He claimed these initiatives would not only create new jobs but also help to combat climate change by decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels.
This proposal drew praise from environmental groups and many members of Parliament, who welcomed the idea of investing in green technologies and pushing forward with plans to become more sustainable overall. The added bonus is that this could potentially lead to lower costs for consumers in the future due to reduced electricity prices caused by increased competition among suppliers.
It remains to be seen how successful these initiatives will prove, however given their potential benefits there seems little doubt Brown has made wise choices when outlining his goals for Britain ahead of the upcoming general election.",phi2,1
"The Conservative Party's Campaign Director, Lynton Crosby, has emphatically rejected allegations that he advised former Prime Minister Michael Howard to concede defeat at the upcoming General Election. 
According to a report published in The Times over the weekend, the Australian political consultant was accused of telling Mr Howard his party would face an uphill struggle to reclaim power after losing its majority last year. However, Crosby vehemently denied this claim stating that “I've had no conversations like it” while commenting on the matter.

Mr. Crosby went onto explain that his primary goal for the upcoming election is to help strengthen Britain's representation within Parliament rather than attempting to gain more seats. He believes that increasing their current standing will ensure they remain as a major influence within British politics long into the future.

This denial comes amidst growing speculation regarding the state of the Conservative Party's electoral prospects following years of poor opinion polls placing them below both Labour and Liberal Democrats in public approval rankings. With less time until polling day fast approaching, all eyes are turning towards the countrys voting intentions during the November 2nd ballot, which could prove pivotal in determining who leads the nation out of recession.

"News Article

    The world’s largest economy, Japan, has taken significant action in helping avert economic disaster in the wake of the devastating natural disaster that struck earlier this month. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced today that his government will donate $500 million dollars to relief efforts and has committed to provide additional support for those affected by the catastrophe. 

Abe's move was met with praise from international leaders who had been warning of an otherwise disastrous situation within the Asian continent. His announcement comes just weeks after Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall in the Philippines, causing catastrophic damage to the country and leaving millions homeless.

With Japanese financial assistance and aid from other developed nations, the cost of rebuilding and recovery efforts are beginning to look more manageable. However, the extent of the devastation caused by the disasters—particularly in vulnerable island communities—will no doubt have long term consequences. 

In addition to financial contributions, leaders from around the world have called for greater attention to being given to pre-disaster risk management strategies. Much like flooding and earthquake readiness plans have become increasingly common in many regions, experts argue that better preparation can help reduce both human and economic losses when catastrophes strike. 

Japan’s donation is a positive step forward in supporting victims of the destruction, but it remains to be seen whether such measures will go far enough to combat the widening gaps between rich and poor countries when it comes to dealing with the effects of climate change. With an ongoing global debate surrounding the most effective ways to avoid or mitigate the impact of natural disasters, Hiroshi Ito, director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security, believes that “only through collective effort [can we] overcome the challenges posed by these events"". 

Theory Of Mind Exercises
1) How did Prime Minister Shinzo Abe feel upon announcing Japan’s decision to donate $500 million?

Answer: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe likely felt relieved, proud, satisfied, and hopeful upon making the announcement as it showed strong leadership and compassion towards fellow citizens during difficult times. He may also have felt encouraged knowing his actions could serve as an example to others and bring hope to people struggling in similar circumstances elsewhere across the globe. 

2) What were some potential motivations behind other world leaders calling for increased focus on pre-disaster risk management?

Answer: Other world leaders' motivation to call for increased focus on pre-disaster risk management might include reducing future costs related to reconstruction and recovery efforts; protecting vulnerable populations and environments; promoting equitable access to resources; and preventing further humanitarian crises. They want to ensure all people have the necessary tools available to respond quickly and effectively to any type of emergency event before it happens. 

3) In what way does UNU Director Hiroshi Ito believe that only through ‘collective effort’ can humanity face the challenge presented by natural disasters?

Answer: UNU Director Hiroshi Ito believes that tackling the problem of mitigating the effect of natural disasters requires cooperation among individuals and governments from different parts of the world. Only through working together can they share knowledge and experiences, identify best practices, develop new technologies, coordinate their response strategies, allocate appropriate funding and resources, build resilient infrastructure, implement early warning systems, create comprehensive policies and regulations and address inequalities at local, national, and international levels. By joining forces collectively, We can make progress in preparing for and responding to disasters and protect our planet against its worst impacts.

"The British government has announced a significant plan to cut taxes, despite widespread criticism from some politicians. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that new tax breaks would be implemented in order for the country to remain competitive. 

This news has been met with opposition from some MPs within the Conservative Party itself. Many feel that the economic strategy is irresponsible and will lead to more debt. The costs of the tax cuts are also not clearly outlined, leading many to question where the funding is coming from. This has caused tension between parties and may result in further conflict as the summer progresses. 

Meanwhile, the prime minister has defended his decision to move forward with the tax cuts. He argued that the measures are necessary for the economy to grow and thrive. He also claims that the changes will create greater fairness and equality in society, allowing all citizens to share in the same opportunities. 

The impact of this news on the nation's economy remains to be seen. Only time will tell whether or not the tax cuts will be successful in their goal to boost the economy. In the meantime, only time will tell what the long-term effects of the policy might be.

"A controversial decision made earlier today could have far reaching implications for British universities and their ability to compete on an international level. 

The Government’s plan to establish E-University – an ambitious project which would allow thousands of students from across the globe access to top quality education without having to physically attend college or campus-based institutions - has faced significant criticism since its announcement. Many academics and experts have voiced concerns that the program could be expensive, ineffective and ultimately fail to deliver meaningful results. 

Despite the negative comments from some quarters, the Department of Education remains adamant that the E-University will be a success story. They argue that the initiative will create new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who might otherwise not have had access to higher education. Additionally it will save money as there is no need for physical buildings to house students, meaning more funds can be reinvested into improving educational services nationwide. 

Although it is still unclear what the long term implications of the E-University will be, one thing is for certain; it has already sparked a lively debate within political circles. This is largely due to the fact that the program was launched during one of the most challenging times in recent history, when public finances were under extreme pressure. It also came shortly after the Prime Minister announced his ambition to make Britain “the best place in the world to start and grow a business.” These two policies seem to contradict each other if the University does not succeed, raising questions around how the Government plans to achieve both objectives simultaneously. 

Only time will tell whether the E-University will prove to be successful or a costly mistake. One thing is clear however; it certainly has generated much excitement and heated debate in short space of time.",phi2,1
"The Liberal Democrat plan for affordable accommodation aims at helping more people achieve home ownership. The initiative involves building 100,000 new “affordable” homes on publicly held land and encouraging public-private partnerships. This will surely bring relief to thousands of households who are struggling to get ahead in the current real estate market. 

The policy proposes creating joint ventures between private developers, landlords and tenants, which could help to reduce costs by sharing resources and labour. It should also make housing more accessible by providing financial assistance to those who cannot afford to buy a house outright.

The addition of new houses from the partnership is expected to create jobs for construction workers, carpenters, architects and engineers. Moreover, it will likely spur economic growth by stimulating local businesses such as schools, shops and healthcare services. In short, this policy has the potential to benefit both individuals and the wider economy.

"The UK political landscape is undergoing an unprecedented change, thanks in no small part to the emergence of two major forces on the national stage. The first of these parties is the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, who are pushing for greater control over government decisions and policies; while the other is the Liberal Democrats, under the leadership of Sir Charles Kennedy, who are seeking to promote more lenient ideologies and solutions that focus more on social justice and equality. 

With elections just around the corner, both parties have been working hard to secure support from the British public. On Monday, Sir Charles Kennedy began a seven-day campaign trail across Somerset and Hampshire, two relatively rural constituencies which are traditionally conservative strongholds. Here he will deliver speeches highlighting the differences between himself and the current governing party, as well as stressing his commitment to protecting civil liberties and promoting freedom of speech. He will also be taking advantage of his visits to local communities to discuss key issues affecting them directly, such as education, healthcare and housing. 

Later this month, Sir Charles Kennedy will travel further south, visiting cities like Liverpool which are seen as particularly vulnerable to Labour's advances in recent years. Here too, he plans to use his platform to spread awareness of Liberal Democratic principles and explain why he believes they can better serve the needs of citizens than any other political party currently in power. In addition, he will seek to address concerns surrounding rising poverty levels and inequality through detailed discussions with constituents. 

Such activities form just one aspect of Sir Charles' overall strategy to increase Liberal Democrat popularity ahead of the election. Over the past few weeks, he has held rallies throughout the country to showcase his party's vision for Britain – from improving access to affordable childcare, to reducing college tuition fees and providing free health care services for all. With the help of these initiatives, it looks likely that the Liberal Democrats stand a strong chance of making substantial progress in the upcoming general election.

"Councillors from across England have come under fire for their handling of the ongoing crisis involving Gypsies and Travellers. After months of living in makeshift camps and facing constant harassment from authorities, hundreds of families continue to remain without permanent homes. This situation has become even more contentious as the government refuses to grant them basic rights, such as access to proper sanitation facilities and education. Meanwhile, local councillors have been accused of failing to make sufficient efforts to resolve the conflict and provide adequate accommodation for those affected. 
The latest development comes after Housing Minister Yvette Cooper announced that councils would no longer need permission from central government before establishing new roads or redeveloping vacant estates near existing traveller sites. This decision seemed aimed at bypassing the legal hurdles which have prevented council leaders from taking decisive action to address the problem. It will also make it easier for local councillors to force gypsy and traveller communities to leave certain areas by enforcing stricter regulations and penalties. 
To make matters worse, many villages and small towns have seen an increase in anti-traveller sentiment due to rising crime rates linked to nomadic lifestyles. For example, residents in some parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria say they feel unsafe walking along footpaths because there is little law enforcement presence and criminals know they can get away quickly if needed. Furthermore, some locals claim that travelling groups often cause damage to buildings and public property during late night parties and festivals held by members of their community. These issues have led many people to call for tougher measures to control where travellers can stay and what activities they may do while visiting different locations around England.
At present, local councils have limited power over how far they can go when dealing with unlicensed campsites – mainly caused by lack of resources and personnel necessary to monitor each site properly. However,. Councillor John Smith, Labour leader in Leeds City Council, told reporters yesterday: “Our priority now is finding ways through working closely with police forces so we can ensure all travellers’ needs are met whilst maintaining order within our cities. We must remember too that these individuals deserve respect just like everyone else regardless of whether they happen to live temporarily or permanently onsite”
Despite this statement being welcomed by activists who support the homeless population, critics point out that such policies fail to take into account the specific circumstances faced by those involved in the issue. Homelessness charity Shelter recently released figures showing one third of rough sleepers suffer mental health problems related directly to homelessness itself rather than any external factors such as poverty or addiction. Therefore it appears crucial for policy makers not only consider short term solutions but think longterm plans including providing better social services for vulnerable individuals and creating more affordable housing opportunities across London and other major centres throughout England",phi2,1
"'The UK is set for a tumultuous time ahead after veteran Labour politician Jack Cunningham announced his resignation from Parliament. The 67-year-old Member of Parliament (MP) had served as an active member of parliament since 2005, but decided that it was time to step down before the upcoming elections. 
Cunningham made his announcement during Prime Ministerial Questions this morning, stating “After 12 years serving the people of Copeland I have come to the difficult decision to resign from this place”. He added that he was thankful for all the support he received throughout his tenure, and wished the best of luck to the new Government and its efforts to bring about positive change to England. 
Since coming into government in 1997, Labour's Jackie Cunningham was seen by many as one of their most loyalists – not only did he hold various positions within Ministries such as Agriculture, Trade & Industry and Environment, but he was also appointed to the position of Cabinet Enforcer by then PM Tony Blair himself - a post which required him to ensure the faithful execution of governmental policy. 
Throughout his career, Cunningham fought tirelessly for issues close to his heart such as animal welfare and conservation; something that earned him praise from both sides of the political spectrum. His passion for these causes led to him being knighted by the Queen in 2015 for services to rural communities. 
In addition to his public service, Sir Jack also took part in several high profile court cases relating to criminal law enforcement and justice system reform. Although he faced criticism from some members of his own party who felt he didn't do enough, his dedication to upholding the rule of law was widely recognised.
As Cunningham takes his seat in history books, there are bound to be plenty of unanswered questions surrounding why he chose to make what can only be described as a controversial move. Some believe it could be due to health concerns while others think it might simply signify a desire to spend more time with family or pursue other interests outside politics. Whatever the reason may be, Sir Jack has certainly left behind quite an impressive legacy whilst in office.'",phi2,1
"Iraqis win death test case probe - In a landmark ruling, Iraqis have succeeded in bringing attention to their fight to uncover the truth surrounding the killing of Baha Mousa. The family of Mousa has been fighting for justice after his alleged murder at the hands of British forces in Iraq back in 2005. For years they have pressed governments and courts around the world into investigating what happened to him while in UK military detention. After much waiting, they are finally seeing results as this week’s decision from the UK Supreme Court grants them permission for a new investigation. 

The court found that Mousa’s death was indeed a violation of human rights law due to the UK government's failure to conduct an adequate investigation before convicting and imprisoning soldiers. This means that despite there being no evidence linking any members of the security forces directly to the crime, they could still face legal repercussions if it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that one did commit it. It also allows the families of victims like Mousa access to seek reparations or other forms of compensation for wrongfully deprived losses caused by such acts. 


For those seeking closure over similar cases elsewhere, today marks another important milestone – the first step towards accountability following international tribunals finding war crimes committed during conflicts between countries like Afghanistan, Syria/Turkey, Somalia etc. Since 2003 more than 40 people involved in armed activities across several regions worldwide including Iraq, Pakistan /Afghanistan & Yemen have gone through various trials which saw guilty verdicts handed down by judges presiding over both civil and criminal proceedings held under different sets of laws. Those convicted include former Afghan President Hamid Karzai (2007) alongside others who faced charges related to extrajudicial killings, torture, sexual slavery among many other serious offenses deemed unacceptable according to international standards set forth decades ago when these treaties came into force. While some may question whether enough has been done thus far given how widespread corruption remains even though numerous indictments made public recently suggest otherwise; we must remember our collective responsibility here too- namely ensuring peace prevails so future generations don't suffer needlessly!

"The controversy surrounding the proposed construction of a new mosque and community center in Swansea, UK had reached fever pitch. It was reported that members of the local population were outraged by an anti-Muslim leaflet which circulated within the area, purportedly signed by members of Britain’s National Party (BNP). 

	South Wales Police responded swiftly to this development, launching an investigation into the matter immediately. They expressed their dismay at the content of the letter - one which called upon locals not to support “Islamization” and suggested that Muslims living nearby could be subjected to increased scrutiny due to their religion or ethnicity. In light of this shocking display of prejudice and discrimination, police have warned against such hate speech being published in any form.

With this sentiment driving them forward, they set out to raise funds so as to turn an old church located off George street into a modern facility where everyone can feel welcome regardless of faith backgrounds.

On account of their tireless work ethic, it wasn't long before their vision became a reality; today, a beautiful, state-of-the-art mosque stands proudly overlooking the heart of Swansea – symbolizing progress, tolerance, and hope for generations to come.

"The Liberal Democrats have unveiled a new campaign slogan for the upcoming UK general election.  The 'Real Alternative' comes from leader Charles Kennedy, who argued that parties such as Labour had let the public down and that the Conservative Party had not done enough to challenge them. 

Kennedy made his remarks during his keynote address at the Lib Dem Spring Conference, held this week in Sheffield.  During his speech, he stressed the party's focus on reducing poverty and inequality, as well as boosting social mobility and opportunities for all. 

The campaign slogan is seen as a departure from the traditional liberal policies of the Liberal Democrats, which have often been perceived as relatively centrist.  This could be an attempt by the party to attract more voters from the conservative right, including those who were unhappy with the policies of the current government. 

Such moves are unlikely to come without criticism from within the party itself.

"In an unexpected turn of events, former Northern Ireland Minister Sir Nicholas Scott passed away yesterday afternoon. He was mourned by colleagues across all parties who had worked closely alongside him over many years. 

Sir Nicholas Scott was a prominent member of the conservative party, serving as an MP since 1979 when he first won the seat of Kensington and Chelsea. It was during this time that he gained recognition for three major contributions; one being his role as Secretary of State for Education and Science under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's leadership (1981–82). This appointment gave him the opportunity to shape policy within one of the most influential government departments in England – something which would have a lasting effect on British educational standards even today. 

However, it was his second contribution to public service that is perhaps most remembered. In 1986, he became Lord Lieutenant of Belfast - the highest official in the city - after being recommended by the then Prime Minister, Elizabeth II. During this tenure, he played an instrumental part in improving relations between the two main communities of Northern Ireland - the Catholic and Protestant communities - through various initiatives such as setting up dialogue groups and promoting cultural exchanges. These efforts helped to foster better understanding among different religious denominations, while also paving the way towards greater political stability in a region which had been plagued by violence for decades. 

His third major contribution came shortly thereafter in 1987, when he returned to Westminster to serve once again as Secretary of State for Education and Science under Prime Minister John Major - this time until 1992. Once more, he used his influence in Whitehall to help improve educational opportunities in England by introducing new programmes which aimed to increase access to higher education for working-class students and boosting vocational training options.

Despite back-to-back stints in ministerial office, Sir Nicholas Scott always seemed happiest performing work outside of government circles. From 1999 onwards, he devoted much of his energy into establishing the Global Policy Forum – an independent research institute dedicated to monitoring global development issues - which continues to operate to this day. He was also active in numerous charity organisations focused on helping disadvantaged youngsters, especially those living in deprived areas or affected by war. 

Last but not least, Sir Nicholas remained politically engaged throughout his lifetime, never shying away from speaking out against injustice or inequality wherever he saw it. His commitment to human rights extended beyond Northern Ireland itself and was recognised worldwide, earning him accolades including honorary degrees from prestigious universities around the globe.

The passing of Sir Nicholas Scott is undoubtedly a great loss to Britain's political landscape and to its citizens both past and present. He will be deeply missed by everyone who knew him, but his legacy of dedication and passion for public service will live on forever.

"In response, Labour leader David Miliband stated on Wednesday night that he strongly supported an amendment proposed by Liberal Democrats MP Norman Lamb. This proposal aimed at adding a two year sunset clause to the Anti-terrorism Bill. However, Prime Minister Gordon Brown was quick to reject this suggestion during a press conference held after his meeting with Cameron and Clegg earlier in the day. He argued that such a provision would undermine the government's efforts in combating terrorism effectively. 

Brown emphasized that the bill included measures ensuring adequate oversight and accountability through independent judicial review processes. Moreover, there were provisions allowing parliamentarians from all political parties to scrutinize the implementation of counterterrorism strategies over the next four years. Additionally, a committee comprised of members representing various sectors including business and civil society organizations also played a crucial role in monitoring progress towards achieving the objectives outlined in the bill. 

While acknowledging concerns raised by the Conservatives regarding the potential consequences if the act remained in force past its expiry date in 2010, Brown firmly asserted that the current approach provided sufficient checks and balances necessary to prevent abuse of power or infringement upon individual rights. Furthermore, the prime minister highlighted the importance of maintaining public confidence in counter-terrorist efforts while addressing legitimate anxieties surrounding privacy and security. 

In conclusion, although the rejection of the Sunnis' terror deal may appear contradictory given their strong stance against further terrorist activities, Prime Minister Gordon Brown remains committed to safeguarding the country's national interests within the framework established by existing laws and mechanisms. By rejecting the compromise offered by the Tories, he reaffirms his dedication to protecting democracy and upholding human rights. With comprehensive legislative frameworks combined with rigorous oversight procedures in place, Britain can continue its fight against terrorism without compromising essential democratic values.

"The Prime Minister's reputation was dealt another blow today after it emerged that he had taken part in a visa application for his then-girlfriend, Kimberly Quinn. The news caused an uproar among Conservative supporters and led to calls for him to resign from cabinet. However, new polling data reveals that despite the controversy surrounding him, the Prime Minister still retains a solid level of public support.

 
According to the survey conducted by the Sunday Times, which interviewed 1,000 UK citizens, 69% believed that Blair’s political career would be negatively affected as a result of this scandal. This number is significantly lower than some earlier polls indicating 70–80%. Only 29% agreed with the sentiment, saying that the incident did not affect their opinion of him at all, while only 7% remained undecided on whether or not they supported the PM personally.

 
On the question of how he could salvage his image if re-elected into office, 49%, almost half of the sample population, felt that Blunkett himself should remain within government even though he was forced out due to the affair with Quinn; 27% of those polled suggested that other ministers might also need to leave. Interestingly however, there were also many who held different views – 16% argued that the whole party ought to stay put, whilst 8% advocated for a full reshuffle instead. When asked what the consequences of such an event may be, 39% predicted a fall in popularity for Blair once again, but 33% disagreed and stated that the effect on him wouldn't have any impact whatsoever. 

  In conclusion, although a considerable proportion of people do feel the damage done by the Blunkett affair will hurt Tony Blair politically, it does seem clear from the findings of this latest poll that the vast majority are determined to give the incumbent Prime Minister one last chance before making drastic changes. With just under two months until the general election, we shall now find out how successful this tactic ultimately proves!


Question: Using the given percentages mentioned above, calculate the exact numbers of people supporting each statement made regarding Tony Blair during the hypothetical situation where a full reshuffled Labour Party wins back power following the general elections. Assume total voting population remains constant.


Calculate the actual percentage of the total population represented by each group. For instance, if 49% of the sample agrees that others including Bluntetnkrow shoulndt return to Cabinet, this means 49% * 1000 = 490 people agree with that statement out of the entire population of 1000 people. Do similar calculations for every statement.


Answer: Following the steps outlined, you can determine exactly how many people hold each viewpoint in case a reshuffling takes place. This involves applying direct proof logic using the calculated values derived from the provided information.

"Jack Cunningham, a veteran politician who served under two Prime Ministers - Gordon Brown and Theresa May – is set to make his exit from Westminster. After 30 years representing his constituency, the long-standing Member of Parliament (MP) for Cumbria South West announced that he would not be running in the upcoming elections. 

Mr Cunningham's announcement comes amid growing tensions between him and his colleagues over the Conservative Party’s Brexit strategy. Despite being one of only four Labour MPs to support Remain during last year's referendum, Mr Cunningham voiced his concerns over the Government’s handling of negotiations with Brussels post-Brexit. The move came after weeks of behind-the-scenes wrangling within the Shadow Cabinet, where some members accused their leader Keir Starmer of lacking leadership. In a statement released by his office, Mr Cunningham said “I want to thank all those I have had the privilege of working alongside over my career but also wish to convey how sad this decision must be for them too."" 

His callous resignation leaves an unprecedented gap in Labour’s frontbench team ahead of the General Election scheduled for December 12th. It follows the departure earlier this week of fellow backbencher Chuka Umunna who resigned following disagreements with Ms Starmer regarding the party’s stance on Brexit. Both men were seen as potential contenders to succeed Corbyn should he resign as Leader later this month. However, despite speculation that they could both contest future leadership bids, neither man has yet confirmed whether or not they plan to run again. 

The news of Mr Cunningham’s impending retirement comes just days before what is expected to be a pivotal moment in British Politics; with many believing it may signal a realigning of forces between the left and right. His legacy will no doubt live on however, as one of the most respected politicians in UK political history.

"Stephanie Pound, an English politician from the past decades of the 20th century, has recently revealed that in a time period marked by carelessness and recklessness (the sixties)  she had managed to have a child - a daughter. The woman's name is Lucy, which reflects both the innocence found in this young life-form and also Pound's own sense of delight for having been able to give one such precious gift despite his reputation. At the time of Lucy's conception she lived with Pound in London, where they resided together until she reached adulthood and began to pursue her ambitions independently. Although Pound did not know it yet, Lucy would come to be remembered fondly throughout the years due to its connection with the former's political career. In addition, Pound himself would go on to lead two terms in government before resigning amid controversy and scandal; while many saw him as a foolhardy leader whose actions were driven more often than not by impulse rather than any real thought or planning.

"The recent ruling from the House of Lords has caused uproar throughout Britain, with many citizens questioning the legitimacy of such a decision. The court determined that detaining twelve individuals accused of terrorist activities without any form of trial is an abuse of power and a violation of basic human rights. This is particularly troubling given the number of those detained have yet to be formally charged with a crime. 

In light of this major development, Home Secretary Charlie Clarke proposed a range of new measures to counteract terrorism which includes house arrests for certain UK citizens who are believed to be linked to terrorism. This measure has been met with intense criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Many believe this is an extreme step too far and gives too much power to the government over its citizens. 

The country's leaders have since released a statement saying they will respect the decisions of the House of Lords but they will still take steps to ensure national security. These steps include increasing the focus on intelligence gathering and analysis, as well as strengthening cyber defence initiatives. 

Charlie Clarke defended his proposed changes, stating it was necessary to protect Britons from potential terrorists. He argued that if someone is suspected of involvement in terrorism then they should be subjected to house arrest, even if there is no formal charging process. He also said that the government will continue to monitor the situation closely and make sure the laws are adhered to. 

The British public has reacted strongly to the news, with many believing it's a breach of their civil liberties and an attack on their privacy. There have been numerous protests both online and offline, with some people holding peaceful demonstrations outside the homes of politicians and others launching campaigns to raise awareness of the issue. 

Despite the backlash, Charlie Clarke remains adamant that he is doing what is best for the nation. He believes that these measures are essential to ensuring the safety and security of the entire population, and that while there may be some inconvenience to those affected, it is a sacrifice worth making. 

Only time will tell how successful these reforms will be, and only time will tell whether the British public's concerns over their civil liberties will be addressed.

    The UK is set to make history this summer, as it becomes one of the first countries in the world to allow teenagers aged 16 and 17 years old to take part in elections. 

    This groundbreaking decision was made after a report released by the country's Elections Committee recommended reducing the legal voting age from 18 to 16. After months of deliberation and public consultation on the proposal, Parliament has now approved it, meaning that young people across Britain will soon have their say in who leads the nation.

	It's been argued that lowering the eligibility criteria will help engage more citizens in the political process and could even lead to better representation. Young adults are often passionate about issues affecting them such as climate change, education reform or healthcare, but feel disenfranchised because they lack a voice at Westminster. By allowing teens to participate in democratic decisions, it should encourage them to get involved earlier on and stay engaged throughout their lives.

	Opponents of this new law raised concerns over whether teenage voters truly understand all aspects related to governance before casting ballots; however supporters believe that educating youngsters through civics classes during school hours could solve any potential problems having well-informed participants acting responsibly while exercising their right to vote.

	Moreover, some critics argue there may be practical challenges associated with implementing such a policy like providing access for disabled individuals or ensuring privacy standards remain high due to online polling sites which can be easily manipulated by hackers – though efforts have already been taken address these points ahead.""""""

"The controversial UK Independence Party (UKIP) has suspended its candidate, John Houston from standing as their candidate in the upcoming South by-election. At the age of 54, Houston had been set to represent the party in the constituency of East Kilbride in North Lanarkshire. 

However, the decision to suspend him came shortly after it was revealed that he had made several comments during an interview with two local Scottish newspapers. His comments included support for the criminalizing of mentally ill individuals and even the suggestion of euthanasia for them, something many found highly objectionable.

As part of the suspension, Houston was required to address the issue publicly and clarify his positions on such matters. He also faced potential repercussions from other political parties which could include fines or legal action. 

This comes amidst a larger debate within the UK regarding immigration policies and Europe's role within the Union. With the Brexit campaign currently dominating the headlines, many are looking towards the next general elections to decide how the United Kingdom will move forward.

"-The political tensions between Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Tony Blair were publicly exposed once again today. 
    This latest dispute centers around who should be credited as responsible for the success of the UK's international aid and debt relief efforts following the devastating Indian Ocean earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Both leaders have so far refused to budge from their positions, leading some to question whether they can ever reach a resolution.

    During their most recent press conference, both Brown and Blair made it clear that they hold firmly opposing views on the matter at hand. Brown argued that his leadership had been integral to the successful implementation of the government’s humanitarian programs, citing the fact that he personally chaired much of its decision making bodies. He further asserted that any praise given to him or the current administration would be unwarranted without taking into account the collective contributions of those within the Cabinet.

Blair countered by claiming that he had done more than enough to ensure that foreign policy objectives remained central during the course of his tenure; specifically referring to how his work had helped secure increased access to finance through multilateral organizations like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). He also pointed out that it was only due to his guidance that the government managed to provide significant financial support to affected regions before the crisis even reached them.

Both men seem set to continue trading jabs in order to prove themselves right and gain public favour. With no sign of agreement forthcoming it remains to be seen what effect this ongoing disagreement will have on British foreign relations. Only time will tell if we'll see a united front or continued division between these two influential figures.

"The government's top official, Patricia Hewitt MP, believes that game warnings must become much more clear. According to her, violent video games need to carry bigger warning labels so that parents will know exactly what kind of content they could be exposing their kids to. The current system isn't working properly as there are currently no legal regulations in place regarding age ratings or how those ratings are applied by retailers. Ms Hewitt hopes to change all this when she addresses an upcoming conference organised by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA). This association represents game companies such as Electronic Arts, Sony Computer Entertainment and Nintendo Co Ltd among others. They have come together with other stakeholders from around Britain to discuss ways of making sure that young people aren’t exposed to inappropriate material due to lack of clarity over age restrictions within gaming media products. 

	Many countries already enforce strict laws governing the production and distribution of video games intended for mature audiences only, but even here it often falls short when trying to protect minors who may still gain access through illegal means like downloading illegally obtained copies online rather than purchasing legitimate ones from licensed stores. In addition, certain types of violence used in video games have caused controversy amongst politicians because they feel this type of imagery might lead towards aggression if viewed regularly without context provided alongside it during gameplay sessions – something that hasn`t yet been addressed either nationally nor locally since no formalized standards exist between individual platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network etc., neither do any specific guidelines pertain specifically toward preventing underage users accessing copyrighted software packages meant exclusively for older demographics only!

"In the world of British politics, there have been few names as synonymous with success as Gordon Brown. As Chancellor of the Exchequer in one form or another since 1997, Brown has made an indelible mark on his country's economy and its people. With a tenure spanning almost twenty-four years and more than four budgets, he is quickly becoming not only the longest serving prime minister in modern history, but also one of the most successful. 

Born on 15 April 1955, Brown was raised by his parents near Rochdale in Greater Manchester. After gaining entry to St John's College, Cambridge, he began his career as an economics researcher before entering political life. In 1983, he became the Secretary of State for Energy and Industry, a post he held until 1985; during this time he implemented major economic reforms such as privatising the electricity sector. 

Since then, Brown has had countless successes throughout his long and illustrious career. He served as Prime Minister from 2007 until 2010, where he gained notoriety for his leadership during Britain’s economic crisis. He successfully passed numerous policies aimed at stimulating growth and development, as well as strengthening public services and welfare programmes. 

Brown has achieved remarkable success as Treasurer as well. Under his watchful eye, UK unemployment rates dropped to their lowest level in over thirty years, while government debt declined significantly. Furthermore, he championed various initiatives to promote green energy development, education reform and financial regulation. His commitment to improving social justice and creating a fairer society for all citizens has been especially noteworthy. 

Gordon Brown’s relentless ambition and dedication to service are qualities that have propelled him to unparalleled heights of accomplishment. There is no doubt that he will go down in history as one of the greatest leaders Britain has ever seen.

"In a shocking announcement, we mourn the passing of Sir Anthony Meyer. The beloved Conservative Party member passed away today after a long battle with cancer. At age 84, he left behind a legacy that will be deeply missed by all those who knew him. 

Sir Anthony served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in British Columbia before being appointed to Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. His dedication to public service was evident throughout his career and he was known for always putting the needs of his constituents first. 

One of Sir Anthony's most notable achievements came during his tenure as Chief Government Whip when he secured a historic agreement between the Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien and the opposition Progressive Conservatives on budget balancing. This breakthrough demonstrated Sir Anthony's commitment to finding common ground and working together for the betterment of Canada. 

However, one incident would forever leave its mark on Sir Anthony's political journey - the infamous `` stalker horse `` leadership challenge against then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989. While Sir Anthony did not emerge victorious in this challenging campaign, he showcased an unwavering determination and courage that inspired countless others within the Conservative Party. 

After stepping down from office, Sir Anthony continued to serve the country through various roles, including serving two terms as President of the Canadian Council of Christians & Jews. During his time there, he worked tirelessly towards promoting interfaith understanding and fostering harmony among diverse communities. 

Today, our thoughts go out to Sir Anthony's family, friends, and colleagues. We remember him as a dedicated public servant, a compassionate leader, and a true patriot who will continue to inspire generations to come. In his memory, let us reflect on the values he held dear and strive to make positive contributions to society ourselves. May he rest in peace.

Exercise 1: Write a short speech expressing your views on the importance of strong moral character in politicians. Provide examples from history or current events to support your argument.
Answer: Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, I stand here today to address a crucial aspect of our political landscape – the need for strong moral character in our elected officials. As responsible citizens, it is imperative that we elect individuals who possess integrity, empathy, and ethical principles. Throughout history, numerous examples demonstrate how the absence of such qualities can have detrimental effects on societies. One cannot overlook the devastating consequences caused by corrupt leaders who prioritize personal gain over the welfare of their constituents. Take, for instance, the Watergate scandal in the United States, which exposed the dark side of power and highlighted the urgent necessity for transparency and accountability. Similarly, we must also learn from recent scandals involving misuse of funds or unethical behavior by prominent figures, reminding us of the vital importance of electing honest and principled representatives. By prioritizing candidates who exemplify strong moral character, we can safeguard our democratic institutions, build trust among citizens, and ultimately shape a brighter future for all.

"The child support agency, headed up by Douglas J. Smith, has been a subject of much criticism recently due to its numerous failures. Despite being publicly denounced for resigning from his position earlier this year, Mr. Smith's appointment has once again come under fire after he returned back into office. This time around, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband raised questions in Parliament regarding why Mr. Smith had not yet left the organization since the start of 2014 - despite reports that suggested otherwise. 
Mr. Johnson initially denied having any knowledge or awareness of Mr. Smith staying put until now, but the latter refused to confirm nor deny if he indeed remained in post. This comes amidst heavy scrutiny of the CSA's operations, particularly when it involves issues concerning child support payments - an issue which can have serious implications should payment be neglected.
At present, the CSA remains plagued with problems; many claimants report receiving little to no financial assistance from those they are supposed to receive payment from. Furthermore, some parents have voiced their displeasure towards what they claim are inadequate efforts made by the agency to ensure timely delivery of services. In light of such criticisms, it seems unlikely that the situation will improve unless drastic changes occur soon. 
It is worth noting that although some progress has already been seen within the last few weeks, further improvements may take longer than anticipated given the magnitude of the task ahead. For now, only time will tell whether the CSA will eventually succeed in restoring public trust in its ability to properly address cases relating to child support payments.

"Charles Clarke, the new Home Secretary, has come under fire from some politicians and civil liberties groups after deciding not to release three Guantanamo Bay detainees. Despite being legally ordered to do so by the US Supreme Court, Mr Clarke decided to reject the prisoners' appeal and keep them in detention because he argued they posed a threat to national security.

On Thursday night, the house of lords made its ruling on the case, which found that the UK's failure to review cases regularly enough violated the human rights of the detained men. Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the leader of the house of lords, said the current system was ""not workable"" and that there should be an immediate end to indefinite detention without trial. He also heavily criticised the government for failing to honour its commitments to introduce legislation to stop prolonged detention. 

The Home Secretary has since been accused of creating a ""two-tier justice system"" between foreign and British criminals, with foreign terrorists given vastly different treatment than those arrested for similar offences here at home. This is particularly concerning as it suggests that the government is willing to violate the human rights of foreigners in order to protect citizens from potential terrorist threats. 

In addition to his refusal to release the three detainees, Mr Clarke has failed to make any further changes to the highly controversial policy ofdetention without charge or trial. This policy has been widely condemned by human rights organisations, who argue that it goes against the basic principles of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Mr Clarke has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of these claims, instead choosing to focus on the need to prevent terrorism at all costs. However, critics argue that this approach could potentially lead to serious abuses and violations of civil liberties in the future.

It remains to be seen whether Mr Clarke will eventually take action to address these concerns, or if he will continue to defend his position on detention without charge or trial. Whatever his decision may be, it is clear that the issue of detainee rights remains a contentious and complex one, with no easy solutions in sight.",phi2,1

"The upcoming parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom have been met with a great deal of scrutiny. With the recent announcement that overseas voters will be able to cast their votes from abroad, but will not be allowed to submit ballots before the deadline, the situation has become even more complex. Electoral commission officials are already hard at work to ensure that the voting process runs smoothly and efficiently.

One major issue facing the election and one which has yet to be fully addressed is electoral fraud. The latest reports suggest that there are concerns about possible manipulation of the results, highlighting the need for increased security measures. It is now clear that greater transparency in the voting process is essential to help maintain trust in our democratic institutions.

Another key challenge ahead of the election is improving voter engagement. With turnout falling in many constituencies, there has been growing concern about the level of political participation in Britain. This was highlighted in a report by two cross-party groups of MPs which called for immediate reforms to the electoral registration system in order to mitigate against electoral fraud and increase citizen involvement.

Despite these challenges, Election Officials remain optimistic. With innovations such as early voting, improved technology and increased access to information, the 2021 UK general election looks set to be a highly successful affair.

Brown made the appeal during his first trip as UK chancellor to sub-Saharan Africa, where he met with leaders from several African governments. Brown was met with cheers and applause when he arrived in Accra, Ghana, and used his keynote speech to call for increased funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.

"Exclusive - EU's top official reveals shocking new report exposing major corruption and scandal at highest levels. 

Robert Kilroy-Silk, a well known political commentator and ex-host of one of Europe’s most popular television shows, has come forward today to criticize British immigration policies and its impact on working class citizens in the United Kingdom (UK). In an exclusive statement released by the European Union Parliament, Kilroy-Silk stated that “The current situation has created a huge imbalance within society – those who have seen no improvement or decline in their financial situations are suffering while businesses take advantage of cheap foreign labour”. He also went on to call out what he called the government's ‘open-door' policy towards migrants which has caused great economic hardship for many UK natives.

According to Kilroy-Silk, the effects of this policy can be felt particularly in areas such as London where property prices have skyrocketed due to increased demand from migrant workers. This increase in rent costs means less money available for locals to invest in housing or education, leaving them more vulnerable to poverty than ever before. Furthermore, there is growing resentment amongst some native Britons toward immigrant communities, leading to tension between different cultures within cities across the country.

It is clear then, that Kilroy-Silk believes the government must act swiftly if it wishes to reverse the damage already done by years of misguided policy making. He suggests introducing stricter regulations around hiring practices so that businesses cannot easily exploit foreign labour markets and instead focus on providing opportunities for local job seekers. Additionally, he calls for greater investment in public services in order to reduce income inequality among all citizens regardless of race or ethnicity.

"News Article: Muslim Police Stops in UK 

    In response to growing concerns over racial discrimination faced by Muslim citizens in the United Kingdom, a government official has confirmed that Muslim individuals are indeed being subjected to an increased risk of being stopped and searched by law enforcement authorities. According to Minister Hazel Blears, this is due to their perceived association with radical Islamism. However, critics argue that such profiling targets innocent Muslims who bear no connection to terrorism or any extremist ideologies.

    Ms. Blears recently participated in a parliamentary committee hearing where she stated her belief that innocent Muslims would inevitably become victims of unwarranted searches simply because they fit the profile commonly associated with individuals belonging to Islamic faith. She asserted further that if there were stricter regulations on qualifying religious leaders seeking entry into the country, it might help mitigate some of the underlying issues leading to suspicion against Muslims. The minister's statements have sparked controversy among various groups, including human rights activists and representatives from minority communities.

    Critics contend that Ms. Blears’ assertions only serve to perpetuate prejudice against Muslims and fail to address the real problem - racially motivated policing practices rather than genuine security threats posed by individuals with malicious intent. They emphasize the importance of ensuring equal treatment under the law without targeting specific ethnic or religious groups based on preconceived notions. Furthermore, experts warn that such discriminatory measures not only erode public trust but may exacerbate existing tensions within society.

	The debate surrounding police stop-and-search operations involving Muslim individuals continues to garner significant attention and calls for action. Advocates for reform stress the need for unbiased policing methods focused solely on individual behavior and intelligence gathering techniques instead of relying heavily on stereotypes. By implementing reforms that promote equality and fairness, policymakers aim to restore confidence among marginalized communities while safeguarding national security interests. Ultimately, striking a balance between protecting civil liberties and effectively addressing potential security risks remains a critical challenge facing both lawmakers and citizens alike.",phi2,1
"The House of Lords, Britain's upper chamber of parliament, made history on Thursday when it overturned the convictions of ten individuals detained under controversial counter terror legislation. 
In December 2020, 10 people were found guilty of offenses related to terrorism and other crimes after they were arrested during investigations into post-9/11 intelligence gathering operations. The group included two Britons who had been living in Syria since 2014, three Iraqis, and five Syrians. All nine detainees had argued that their detention was illegal because it had not been approved by Parliament. 
The Supreme Court originally upheld the conviction of each detainee but the decision was reversed by the House of Lords on Wednesday, granting them a second chance at justice. Lord Neuberger, the president of the House of Lords, stated that while the security risks posed by some of the detainees could not be ignored, the conditions of their detention must also be considered. He noted that for many years the British government had failed to comply with its own obligations under international law which requires any detention to be based on sufficient evidence.
The ruling will have significant implications for the future use of detention powers among governments around the world. It suggests that those seeking to suppress dissent or criminal activity through unlawful means may find themselves subject to greater scrutiny from judges and lawmakers. It is now likely that similar cases filed against countries like the United States will receive more attention due to this landmark decision. 
This development comes as tensions remain high between Western nations and terrorists groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State. Since the 9/11 attacks, numerous military interventions and covert missions involving special forces units have taken place across multiple continents – often without proper oversight or transparency. Many fear that if unchecked these activities can lead us further down the path towards authoritarianism or even war crimes.

"The UK government has come under fire from multiple sources for its decision to reject using telephone tapping as evidence in criminal cases. This move has caused significant controversy amongst various different stakeholders, including human rights groups, top law enforcement officials, several MPs, and even the head of the European Union's justice commissioner. 

The decision to deny phone-tap evidence despite its availability in numerous other jurisdictions within Europe has been met with widespread criticism from those who believe that it represents a major step backwards in terms of civil liberties and justice. The government's failure to acknowledge this evidence could have serious consequences; the security and safety of citizens across the country are at stake if terrorist activities continue to go unchecked.

Despite this opposition, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, remains firm in his position. He asserts that relying on phone-tap evidence would increase the potential for false accusations and wrongful convictions. Furthermore, he claims that such evidence does not always provide an accurate picture of what happened between two individuals during a conversation. 

Many politicians, however, disagree with Mr Clarke's views. They point out that phone-tap evidence can be used responsibly and effectively, and argue that denying access to it will only serve to undermine public trust in the legal system. Additionally, some have argued that failing to use this type of evidence puts Britain in danger of falling behind its peers when it comes to combating terrorism. 

The debate surrounding the issue of phone-tap evidence continues to rage on, with no clear resolution in sight. Only time will tell whether or not the UK government makes the right call when it comes to protecting the security of its citizens while still upholding their basic civil liberties.

"Mrs. Julia Howard, a former model and current political figurehead for the British conservative party, has been officially confirmed as an integral part of their upcoming election strategy. 
She will be making frequent visits to potential voting precincts in hopes of swaying voters from the opposing parties. Furthermore, she will also accompany her husband, Prime Minister David Cameron, during his nationwide helicopter tour which is set to begin this month.
Mr. Cameron has chosen to launch the party's campaign directly by hosting daily press conferences at their headquarters in London. The purpose of these meetings is twofold; firstly to proclaim their plans and objectives to the public, and secondly to provide the public with ample opportunity to ask questions.
The Conservatives have taken great care to ensure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light. They have hired the most experienced professionals in various fields such as marketing and communications to help create a powerful message for their audience. This initial step is crucial in setting the tone for the entire campaign. It is intended to convey a strong sense of confidence and trustworthiness.
In addition to their traditional methods of campaigning, the Conservative Party has adopted some unconventional tactics as well. These include using social media influencers to spread positive messages about the party among younger demographics, creating eye-catching billboards around major cities, and even holding rallies outside local supermarkets where customers can hear speeches while shopping!
Overall it seems like the British Conservatives are determined to make sure that their voices reach all corners of Britain before November 4th when elections take place across England & Wales. With such extensive preparation going into their efforts one could expect nothing less than success.",phi2,1
"The Liberal Democrats have stressed that there needs to be more transparency from Chancellor Gordon Brown over where government funds are being allocated. With so much controversy surrounding economic policies, it has become increasingly difficult for citizens to place their faith in what the government is doing. This lack of faith stems partly from the fact that many people feel they do not have access to enough information in order to make informed decisions. 

City experts agree that there is currently a significant budget deficit which cannot be ignored; estimates suggest this could be as high as £40 billion. When added to already existing national debt levels, this would represent an enormous strain on public resources. The news comes at a time when fiscal responsibility must be prioritised due to the current state of the global economy.

Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Spokesman, highlighted the need for greater accountability and openness from the government in terms of its use of taxpayers' money. He argued that without such measures, public trust in the administration will remain low. In order to rebuild this trust, Mr. Brown should consider opening up his budgets to independent analysis in order to ensure fairness. It is essential that those responsible for managing public finance understand how best to utilize taxpayer's dollars and to avoid wasteful spending.

2. Government's Response - Despite opposition from many stakeholders who believe that the changes will cause more harm than good, Prime Minister John Smith remains adamant that the reforms must go through in order to better prepare students for life outside of education.
3. Potential Backlash - If the reforms were to fail, it would be seen as yet another example of the British government's inability to deliver meaningful change to its citizens, potentially leading to further unrest among the population.
4. Alternatives Discussed - To mitigate the effects of such a decision, various alternatives including keeping current qualifications while introducing additional training programs have also been discussed; however, none have so far received enough support from either students or educators.

"In a locked room at the heart of Parliament, there lies an entire world of political scandals. This infamous place where secrets and controversy reign supreme is also home to one particular group who's lives have been affected by the drama - the divorced couple, John and Jane Smith. Despite their differences, they had both come here for the same reason; to try and make sense of what happened between them when they were married. 

John and Jane had met during the early 1990s, while working as junior staff members on opposing sides of government affairs. At first, everything seemed perfect - they shared the same views on most issues, enjoyed similar hobbies, and even fell in love quickly. But soon enough, their relationship began to unravel due to irreconcilable disagreements and misunderstandings. Eventually, after months of fighting and tension, they decided to call it quits and go through with their separation.

Although both agreed that the marriage was over, neither knew how to cope without each other's company. As weeks passed, loneliness set in and feelings of sadness and regret started to take hold. Then, one day, out of nowhere, came a surprise visitor to the office building – the estranged couple’s former co-worker and friend from college, Peter Jones.

Peter hadn't seen either of his old friends since the split and wanted to help bridge the gap between them. He proposed organizing a reunion dinner so that everyone could catch up and hopefully put aside their grievances. Everyone thought it would be a good idea and soon enough, the plan was in motion.

On the night of the event, John and Jane arrived separately, not knowing what to expect. When they entered the restaurant, however, they were immediately greeted warmly by everybody present. The atmosphere felt strangely familiar yet different, which made the two feel oddly comforted. After exchanging pleasantries, the conversation eventually turned towards the events leading to their break up and why it ended the way it did. 

At first, nobody wanted to address the elephant in the room directly, afraid of saying something wrong that might cause another argument. However, slowly the truth gradually emerged and before long, both parties finally understood where things went wrong and accepted responsibility for their part in the dissolution of their marriage. It was only then that peace could start to settle again.

Theory of Mind Exercises (with answers):
1) What if Peter Jones didn't propose having a reunion dinner? How should he change his behavior in order to keep the situation from escalating further?

Answer: If Peter Jones wasn't proposing the reunion dinner, he should have taken some steps to ease the tension between the couple instead, such as suggesting activities like taking a walk together around town or going for lunch somewhere neutral. These actions may have helped to foster understanding and empathy between John and Jane rather than pushing them away from each other even more. Additionally, he could've tried to act as a mediator throughout the discussion and refrained from intervening unless necessary. Ultimately, the goal should have been creating a safe space for the two exes to express themselves openly and honestly about their emotions, hopes, fears, etc., without feeling attacked or judged. 

2)What if John and Jane never visited the office building together in the first place? Would their reconciliation still happen? 

Answer: If John and Jane never visited the office building together, it is highly unlikely that they would reconcile because visiting the office building was crucial for allowing the two of them to talk freely and understand exactly where the problems stemmed from. Without being physically close, there was no chance for them to rebuild trust or open lines of communication effectively, leaving much of their unresolved conflicts unaddressed. Even though meeting at the office building provided a unique opportunity for closure, reconciling can ultimately depend heavily upon personal effort and willingness from both people involved. 

3)What if the reunion dinner didn't occur at all? Is there any other alternative action that could lead to resolution between John and Jane?

Answer: Yes, there are many alternatives to resolving conflict between John and Jane apart from holding a reunion dinner. Other options include seeking professional counseling, talking to mutual friends who are aware of the issue, participating in couples therapy sessions, engaging in mediation with an impartial third party, writing letters to each other expressing their thoughts and feelings, practicing active listening skills, setting boundaries, and establishing clear expectations moving forward. All of these strategies allow both individuals to work through difficult situations constructively without resorting to",phi2,1
"Sports betting legislation was recently under scrutiny by a joint committee of UK Parliament, comprising members from both Houses. After months of investigating the issues around online sports gambling, the panel made 10 recommendations for regulating the industry more effectively. 
The key points raised by the report included the need to establish clear guidelines regarding when it is acceptable to bet, who can do so, and what types of bets are permitted. Additionally, the team discussed the importance of ensuring that there is transparency surrounding how bets are processed and paid out, as well as taking necessary steps to prevent fraud.
Some of the other proposals put forward by the committee were to introduce limits on the amount someone can wager per session or over a period of time. This would help to reduce the likelihood of addiction developing amongst players, as well as preventing underage individuals from accessing and placing bets.
Furthermore, the researchers also called for increased enforcement of existing laws related to betting, so as to deter criminals from operating within this sector. The group argued that stronger penalties should be imposed on those found guilty of breaking the law – including larger fines and longer prison sentences.
Overall, the group’s report serves as an important reminder of the need to regulate the sports betting market carefully and responsibly. With luck, these measures will help to ensure that the industry remains fair and transparent for everyone involved.

"1. He was born on May 8th, 1950 in Wakefield. Growing up in West Yorkshire, he developed an interest in politics from a young age and became actively involved in local issues within his community.
2. After graduating from the University of London with degrees in political science and sociology, Blunkett pursued a career in journalism before entering parliament at the tender age of 23. His background in reporting gave him a unique perspective that shaped his approach to governance and policymaking later in life.
3. As Home Secretary under Tony Blair's premiership, Blunkett gained national recognition for being one of only two government officials allowed access to private conversations between Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie Blair without their knowledge or consent (the other official is Harriet Harman). This privilege came after the controversial phone call scandal involving the former prime minister John Major and The Sun newspaper which implicated both major parties in breaking campaign spending limits. In this case, it led to allegations made by The Independent against the Labour Party during its 1997 election campaign. 
4. Despite initially having been praised for maintaining law and order in Britain following 9/11, Blunkett faced criticism over his handling of the 2001 riots across England, especially in inner cities such as Oldham, Bradford and Leeds where large numbers were arrested, charged and imprisoned. Many felt he failed to provide sufficient resources to deal effectively with the situation resulting in more violence than necessary.
5. One incident particularly highlighted his lacklustre response. At the end of June 2003 when the largest rioting occurred since 1981 in East London, the Metropolitan police had just 200 officers deployed while the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, dispatched 3,000 additional policemen into Harlem alone despite there not yet being any reports of looting in the area. By comparison, even though there weren't many reports of looting in Tottenham, North London, the Met had 500 extra personnel assigned. These decisions drew heavy scrutiny leading some commentators to suggest that politicians were attempting to deflect attention away from domestic matters ahead of an impending EU referendum taking place less than four months later. Others blamed Blunkett himself, suggesting that if he'd taken control instead of waiting until he arrived back in office hours after midnight on Sunday morning to address the problem, perhaps fewer people could have lost lives due to the violence caused by unsupervised youths roaming through areas devoid of adults present. Ultimately though, the truth may be somewhere inbetween – although certainly not enough can ever justify either side’s behaviour given what happened subsequently; namely that dozens died unnecessarily because authorities simply didn't take decisive action quickly enough!",phi2,1
"In today’s post, we focus on the upcoming election and its potential impact. With an election coming up for the UK, all parties have been gearing up to make significant promises, aiming to win over voters from all walks of life. 

The primary goal of any party is to gain voter support by offering tangible benefits. Thus, it's no surprise that the discussion around the pre-election budget has become a central topic of debate. Each party will try to find ways to give the electorate what they want – whether it be increased spending on healthcare, more competitive tax rates, or greater investments in public services. 

The British government has long used budgets as a tool to boost their electoral chances. Those elected get to set the tone of the nation’s finances and can even use fiscal policies to stimulate economic growth. In such a climate, the Conservative Party needs to demonstrate that they are capable of delivering on their manifesto pledges during this election year. It remains to be seen how much influence the upcoming budget will have on the voting behaviour of the citizens.

Given the current political landscape, it is unlikely that the budget will be particularly inspiring to most voters. The Conservatives need to find creative ways to appeal to those who may not typically vote for them. One way to accomplish this could be through reducing taxes for middle-income earners, creating jobs in areas where unemployment is high, or introducing measures to help struggling families. Such initiatives should be aimed at making people feel like their voices are being heard and their needs are being addressed.

Of course, it is important to note that the budget is only one part of the equation when it comes to gaining votes. Political campaigns must also include effective messaging which highlights the strengths and accomplishments of the respective candidates and parties. This includes focusing on issues such as national security, immigration reform, education, health care, and infrastructure development.

It is clear that the upcoming budget plays an integral role in setting the stage for the general election. Whether it leads to smiles on the faces of voters or not depends largely on how well the Conservative Party can articulate their plans and create meaningful change. Only time will tell if this pre-election announcement was successful or not.

"The home secretary, Sir Michael Howard, yesterday announced that he was introducing a new points-based immigration policy designed to make it easier for high-skilled workers and business people from outside of Europe to migrate to Britain. The proposed policy replaces the current EU single market policies which allow anyone within the free trade zone access to work in any member state without restriction. 

Sir Michael said the new policy will create an effective and efficient system which rewards those immigrants with skills which are likely to benefit the British economy. He also added that the policy does not involve quotas or caps as suggested by some political opponents of the Conservative Party, including their own leader Tony Blair. 

Mr David Cameron had earlier this week been accused by opposition leaders of wanting to introduce a “hostile environment” for migrants to try and reduce net migration levels. However, the Prime Minister's official spokesman denied these claims saying that such a policy could only be introduced after consultation with both Parliament and local authorities.

"The ongoing saga between ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government and the UK parliament has once again come to a head, as MPs have voted overwhelmingly against raising taxes on the country. The vote was passed with 348-131, indicating just how much support there is for the Tories within Parliament. This comes as no surprise to many given the number of times they highlighted the unfairness of the increases in taxes during their campaigns. It also shows that the Conservatives are gaining ground despite the efforts of the Liberal Democrats and other parties to counter their agenda. 

At the heart of this political debate is the issue of social inequality. While some argue that increasing taxes is necessary to fund vital public services such as health care and education, others believe that these so-called ""taxes"" unfairly burden the wealthy few while doing little to help the majority. This makes the situation all the more complex, as both sides seem to be making valid points. Response from the PM himself has been lukewarm at best, with him suggesting that the decision should be left up to the electorate in upcoming elections. This only serves to further highlight the divisions within British society, as well as the lack of consensus when it comes to dealing with important issues.

"- PM Apology Over Jailings - Prime Minister Tony Blair is expressing his deep sorrow regarding a tragic incident from the past. In a press conference yesterday, he took responsibility for the wrongful imprisonment of eleven individuals for the IRA's bombing attacks in Guildford and Woolwich back in 1974. This shocking event caused immense suffering not only to those wrongly convicted but also to their families. 

    Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke solemnly today as he addressed a crowd gathered outside the Guildford pub where the victims had been falsely accused before being jailed for almost three years. The events surrounding this miscarriage of justice shook Britain's faith in its legal system, leaving lasting scars on many innocent lives affected by it. 

   In his heartfelt speech, Blair acknowledged the pain endured by all parties involved – the convicts, their loved ones, and even law enforcement authorities themselves who became complicit during investigations. Asking them to accept apologies would be difficult; however, acknowledging the truth behind the mistake will go down well with the public if handled correctly. 

  The wrongfully imprisoned convicts have already accepted the government's offer of compensation worth £1million each (about $2.4 million) and an additional sum equivalent to six months' wages ($7000). Yet, the impact of the trauma experienced cannot simply be measured through financial terms alone. It takes more than material restitution to heal wounds inflicted upon innocence tarnished. 

  Tony Blair expressed regret at what happened stating that it remains one of the most significant mistakes committed within British history. He admitted that although there are still unanswered questions concerning how the conviction occurred, he could never forget the hurt and anguish it created for both the defendants and their family members. 

  While no amount can ever truly repair the damage done or make up for the lost time spent locked away unjustifiably, Mr Blair urged everyone to find closure now and move forward into building a stronger community based on trust once again. His aim is clear—to ensure that this kind of tragedy does not repeat itself anytime soon.""""""

With so many important matters at stake, it's no surprise that different interest groups are gearing up to influence public opinion before April 17th when all major parties will seek re-election under new leaders.

    What the Election Should Really Be About?
    One of the main topics that people have been discussing lately is whether or not raising awareness around mental health issues deserves more attention than other pressing concerns such as healthcare costs, climate change, education, immigration, Brexit, taxation reform, welfare benefits cuts or infrastructure spending. The truth is that while each one of those areas certainly plays its role in shaping our lives, some argue they deserve less prominence due to lack of evidence showing them as having significant impacts compared to others like poverty, inequality and unemployment - which can affect anyone regardless of age group, race/ethnicity, gender or geographical location. This raises questions about why certain topics seem to dominate media coverage even if research does not support this approach. 


The importance of Mental Health Campaign Awareness Raising
One area where increasing awareness could potentially lead positive changes would be related specifically to mental health care services within both hospitals (such as NHS trusts across England) and community settings throughout regions nationwide including cities, townships etc.; however it remains difficult for us to ascertain just how much progress might result given existing funding constraints associated alongside limited resources available for implementing effective policies aimed towards improving access points offered by local authorities who provide various forms assistance via clinics & centers dedicated solely toward treating patients experiencing psychiatric conditions; additionally another key issue highlighted during discussions surrounding this topic relates back to stigma preventing individuals suffering form speaking out openly& freely seeking help without fear of judgment based upon stereotypes associated commonly held beliefs amongst society concerning those diagnosed with depression disorders among other mental illnesses – especially considering potential negative repercussions experienced following disclosure(i.e., loss job opportunities )which often deterred victims away from taking proactive steps necessary needed for self improvement ; thus making it crucial for campaigns focusing on creating greater understanding through proper messaging designed specifically tailored targeting specific audiences rather simply talking down problems faced by everyone else without acknowledging individual circumstances unique characteristics needs requirements etc..

"In recent times, EU has been facing unprecedented challenges due to its inability to control the ongoing financial crisis. Amidst all this chaos, one country which managed to remain relatively unaffected is United Kingdom (UK). With a GDP of 1.8 trillion USD as per latest data from World Bank, the UK’s economy continues to thrive while other European nations are yet to fully recover. 
The strength of the UK's economy can largely be attributed to sound fiscal policies implemented over the past decade along with an increase in public investment. These investments have helped drive growth in key sectors such as manufacturing, finance and technology. Additionally, government initiatives designed to promote innovation and research & development have further bolstered business confidence in Britain. 
Moreover, the decision taken recently not to join the Eurozone has proved beneficial for the UK's currency exchange rates, allowing them to maintain greater flexibility when conducting international trade. This newfound freedom provides businesses with more opportunities to expand their operations globally without having to worry about fluctuations in foreign markets caused by common monetary policy set up by eurozone countries.
Furthermore, it should also be noted that despite some criticism surrounding Brexit – i.e., the withdrawal process undertaken after the referendum held last year; –the overall impact thus far seems quite positive on both national and regional levels. For instance, since 2017 there has been increased access to global capital sources for small-scale entrepreneurs who require funding at lower interest rates than before 2014–2015 era characterized heavily by stringent regulations imposed by Brussels officials leading many aspiring innovators away from entering into new projects altogether due fear associated potential costs resulting from bureaucracy associated with obtaining necessary permits/licenses needed prior launch activities within Europe”.",phi2,1
"The United Kingdom is planning significant cuts to its international presence, with nine major overseas embassies and high commissions to be closed.  This decision was made by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown during his visit to India earlier this week. The closures include those of the British Embassies in Bahrein, Dhaka, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kenya, Malawi, Maldives, Mozambique, and Nairobi; as well as high commissions in Mumbai and New Delhi. 

The government has explained that the moves are necessary in order to reduce spending, due to tight economic conditions. It is expected that the cost savings could reach around £600 million each year. The country may look to other countries to take on some of the responsibility of diplomacy. In addition, locals might be hired to manage some of the post offices which currently run by expats. 

This comes amid a larger trend of countries reconsidering their expenditure on foreign relations. For instance, last month China announced it was cutting $1 billion from its budget in order to fund its military. Meanwhile, the US is no longer making the annual donation to the UN’s peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

British officials have acknowledged the need to make difficult decisions in order to ensure financial stability, but the impact of these changes will be felt globally. Many experts believe that the global economycould see further growth issues if the UK opens up too many doors and reduces its involvement in world affairs. 

A spokesperson for the Department for International Development (DFID) said that while the department understands the concerns of the public, the Government has had to find ways to reduce costs without compromising national security. “We are confident that this can be done through careful planning and consideration of the potential consequences”. Response: 1. What was the reason behind the UK's decision to reduce its diplomatic presence?
2. How much does the UK expect to save annually through this decision?
3. Which two cities were not mentioned as locations of former embassies or high commissions to be closed down?

"Pensioners in Britain are set to benefit from big cost-saving measures introduced by the current liberal Democrat government, according to recent statements made during their annual conference. 

The policies include a reduction of costs associated with heating homes during the winter months, with subsidies totalling up to £100 per person annually, while those over the age of 80 can receive an extra £300. In total, pensions were projected to be saved by millions of retirees across the country. 

This move comes amid high levels of inequality among pensioners, with many struggling to pay their bills in the colder months. By offering more financial support and better protection from extreme weather conditions - such as icy roads and sub zero temperatures - it is hoped that the new policy will help reduce poverty rates amongst this demographic.

The announcement has been welcomed by older citizens groups who say the changes represent real progress towards creating a fairer society. Helen Jones, chief executive of One Senior Voice, said: ""We are delighted to see the Liberal Democrats recognising the struggles faced by older people and taking steps to address them.

"'Viktor Makarov, a former Russian intelligence officer and spy, has recently entered into his 7th month long hunger strike outside No.10 Downing Street in London to protest against what he believes are unjust treatment from British officials. 

Makarov was initially offered a large sum of money – $650,000—in exchange for compromising information on various operations conducted by Russia's military security agency, known as GRU. He accepted the deal under the condition that he be treated like any other UK resident; however, since then, he said he had endured humiliation and mistreatment at the hands of the government. Despite being granted asylum in 2014, the ex-agent claimed he was never given refugee or defectors’ status which entitled him to certain benefits available to such individuals. 

This week, Makarov started another round of fasting, saying he intends to stay until his demands are met. His main demand? The recognition of his special status as a whistleblower, one who put his own safety on the line in order to expose abuses perpetrated by the Kremlin. He also demanded financial compensation for the hardship he suffered due to the denial of his applications. In addition, Makarov called upon the British public to rally around him and show their support for refugees and immigrants facing similar struggles throughout Europe.

"The Police and Crime Commissioner for West Midlands, Andy Marsh, is leading an initiative aimed at reducing crime in the region. The plan involves introducing new legislation which would allow citizens to purchase and consume alcohol outside of traditional bars and restaurants during specific hours. 
Marsh announced his plans earlier this month, stating that the initiative would be beneficial for local businesses and help to reduce the amount of time and money spent on policing associated with regulating or enforcing current laws. 
He went on to say that the decision was made after careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy. As part of the proposal, Marshall also introduced measures to minimize any potential negative effects, such as providing additional support to affected communities and ensuring there were adequate resources in place to enforce the new regulations. 
In order to further demonstrate his commitment to public safety, Andy Marsh has invited representatives from various sectors to discuss their thoughts and opinions on the proposed policy and explore ways to make sure that its implementation goes smoothly. This shows that the commissioner is actively seeking feedback from those directly impacted by the changes, indicating a responsible approach to leadership.
Overall, the introduction of these new laws does not appear to be without controversy; many have expressed concern over the possible consequences of allowing individuals to drink more freely outside of traditional establishments. Despite this opposition, Marshall remains convinced that the initiative will ultimately result in greater convenience and security for residents while simultaneously creating economic opportunities. Only time will tell how successful these reforms will prove to be.

"The Labour Party has proposed an increase in paid maternity leave, aiming at raising it from its current rate of six weeks up to nine months. According to a report on the BBC's ""Sunday Politics"", this will cost an additional 1.4 billion pounds each year, making total spending on family-related benefits 3.7 billion per year. 

Ms Patricia Hewitt, who is responsible for employment affairs, said that the changes are necessary so that women can have more time off work after giving birth.

"Gordon Brown is calling for an end of what he calls the political apathy which he claims has become all too common across England. In a bold move, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has urged Labour Party members to get out and cast their votes in the upcoming General Election due to take place on Monday, May 5th. 

The timing could not have been more appropriate as polls suggest that the Conservative Party's stock is currently far lower than its Liberal Democrat counterpart. This gives Mr Brown a distinct advantage going into the election, but it also means that any victory for the Conservatives will be even more devastating should they win the majority of seats.

With this in mind, the Prime Minister is making it clear that there can be no complacency among those who believe that the current government deserves re-election based solely upon past performance. The Chancellor warned against staying at home and voting tactically rather than casting your ballot according to conscience, citing recent local elections where low turnout caused by tactical voting led to unexpected results.

Mr Brown further emphasised the importance of having faith in one's chosen candidate before heading to the polling booth. With so much uncertainty facing Britain right now, from economic issues such as inflation to security problems like terrorism, only genuine commitment and belief in the future of our country can help ensure that we make the most informed decisions when electing representatives to Parliament.

In conclusion, I hope my speech has made it abundantly clear why every single person in England should be getting ready to exercise their democratic rights and participate fully in what promises to be one of the most important national events of our lifetimes.""",phi2,1
"The world is waiting for news out of Spain as two days of high-level talks between Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and British Prime Minister David Cameron come to an end. The discussions have focused primarily on Gibraltar, a small British territory located at the southern tip of Spain. 

At the core of these negotiations is the future sovereignty of Gibraltar. Both leaders have been putting forth their views on the issue, but so far, no major breakthrough has been made. This has led some analysts to suggest that the chances of reaching an agreement are slim. 

However, there is one element in this discussion which could potentially change the course of history. Namely, the two leaders have agreed to establish a special committee to look into the matter further. This commission will be composed of experts from both sides who will examine all aspects of the situation before making any recommendations. It is hoped that this approach will help to find a solution which satisfies everyone involved. 

If successful, this initiative could set a precedent for other disputes around the world. Such a diplomatic process may prove to be an effective way of resolving conflicts without resorting to aggressive measures. It will also demonstrate the power of dialogue when dealing with sensitive issues. 

In addition, it is important to note that both Spanish and British leaders have shown great restraint throughout this difficult process. Each side has respected the opinions of the other, and they have worked hard to reach an understanding. This level of mutual respect is essential if the future relationship between the two countries is to succeed.

"Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of Great Britain, is expected to come under intense scrutiny in the upcoming UK general elections as he prepares to face off against other major political figures. An ongoing poll from Gallup suggests that public trust in the Labour Party has been consistently declining since 2003, with President Bush's approval ratings now surpassing those of Tony Blair's. The polling indicates that 83% of respondents have little or no confidence in the current British government. In an effort to address this lack of trust and restore his reputation, Tony Blair promises to tackle issues related to personal integrity and transparency head-on throughout the electoral campaign. 

During an interview aired on Five News, a popular television network for younger audiences, Tony Blair addressed concerns regarding his past decisions while in office. He acknowledged having no choice but to openly discuss matters surrounding his leadership style and moral compass. By doing so, Mr. Blair aims to engage directly with potential voters and demonstrate his commitment to addressing their needs. Furthermore, he dismisses accusations made about the government's initiatives, specifically targeting efforts aimed at increasing higher education participation among youth. Mr. Blair emphasizes the importance of considering alternative pathways such as vocational training alongside traditional academic routes. His stance reflects a recognition of varying interests and aspirations amongst different segments of society. 

This forthcoming election represents a significant opportunity for Tony Blair to regain lost ground and rebuild voter support. However, the success of his endeavors depends heavily on how effectively he communicates with constituents and demonstrates genuine concern over important societal issues. It remains crucial for him to maintain high ethical standards and establish himself as a trustworthy figure in order to win back the faith of the disillusioned electorate. With the stakes raised by the impending contest between multiple prominent politicians, the outcome of this election could shape not only the future course of UK policymaking but also influence perceptions of national unity and democratic values.

"The debate surrounding human cloning, particularly therapeutic or medical use cases, has been ongoing since its introduction. It's an extremely complicated topic with many different arguments both in support and against it. From the early days, many have believed that it goes against the natural order of things, while others have argued that it holds the potential to do great good. However, despite the enthusiasm from some corners, most countries remain unenthusiastic on the subject, considering the ethical implications involved. In addition, more significant issues like genetic manipulation, privacy concerns, and the safety of those undergoing such procedures need to be taken into consideration. For this reason, much remains to be done before human cloning can become a reality. This is especially the case as the technology behind it has yet to reach the level necessary for safe and successful applications. On the other hand, proponents argue that, if approached responsibly, it could lead to remarkable new treatments and cures for diseases. These claims have yet to be proven, however, as further research is needed to fully understand the possible consequences of human cloning. Despite the controversy surrounding it, one thing is clear: human cloning involves risks that must never be ignored.

"News Article:

    Political parties across Britain are urging broadcasters to make plans for an election year TV debate featuring the country’s top three leadership contenders, The Guardian reported. 

According to research by the nonpartisan think tank Hansard Society, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey should all participate in such a forum before voters head to the polls next month. 

The survey found that 78% support from members was given for a potential discussion during this time, while only 5% were opposed, making it one of the most popular proposals put forward so far. 

It is hoped that holding such a broadcasted debate will provide an opportunity for the candidates to articulate their policies more effectively as they prepare for what could potentially be an extremely tight race leading into December's general election. 

This move has been welcomed by some experts, who believe it could help reduce tensions between opponents ahead of the vote - something which is increasingly becoming necessary due to rising levels of hostility since the start of 2020, particularly around topics like Brexit negotiations. 

Boris Johnson’s position regarding his willingness or refusal to join any debates prior exists yet remains unclear following comments made last week when he suggested “we can't always agree"". Such comments caused uproar amongst many observers who feel strongly about having greater clarity concerning future arrangements related both politically but also within civil society itself. 

Meanwhile, Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds stated her own intentions to appear at least once throughout campaigning period if elected officials choose otherwise than hosting meetings themselves; adding further fuel fire over disagreements surrounding possible outcomes associated specifically with broadcasting opportunities granted exclusively for certain individuals instead of those deemed worthy enough based solely off merit alone."" This stance appears likely to cause friction among opposition figures whilst simultaneously raising questions relating directly towards fairness within democratic process overall.

"Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have announced that they intend to take a strong stance against any potential changes to the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union (EU) during negotiations. This announcement came as no surprise given their previous statements emphasizing the UK's commitment to maintaining its current level of access to, participation in, and contribution to the EU single market and customs union. 
Cameron stressed that the Conservative Party remains committed to working together closely with the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats to ensure that all parties involved can work towards an agreement which benefits everyone in the country. He also emphasized his party's desire to protect jobs within British industry while still protecting consumer rights, particularly those associated with food standards set by Brussels. In addition, he highlighted how important it would be to continue funding public services such as healthcare and education. 
In response to recent comments from Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy suggesting that countries receiving aid through the European Stability Mechanism should give something back in return, Cameron reiterated the government’s position that this money must remain available for those most in need and argued there are many other areas where financial contributions could instead go if necessary. 
He concluded by reaffirming the UK's commitment to standing firmly alongside the rest of Europe when taking action on issues related to immigration reform and security measures designed to combat terrorism throughout the region.""""""

"'Hague Given Up His Prime Minister Ambition' 
He had been trying since then, but it seemed that nothing could bring him success. He had come close many times, only to fall short in the end. Despite this, he refused to give up on his dream of one day becoming the UK's prime minister. 

The former Conservative leader had spent the last few years working tirelessly to promote himself as a viable candidate. He had attended countless rallies and debates, published several articles, and even reached out directly to voters. Yet despite his efforts, he never quite managed to capture enough support to make it past the first round of voting. 

It was during an interview with The Times newspaper earlier today that Mr. Hague finally made the announcement - he was giving up hope of ever being elected to the position of British PM. In his statement, the former Conservative Party chairman said that while he still believed in public service and wanted to do whatever he could to help improve the nation's fortunes, pursuing a political career no longer felt like the right path for him. 

''I have enjoyed doing what I've done so far, and if there is something else that calls to me then perhaps I should pursue that,'' he said. ''But at this point, looking back over my work and all that has gone before, I cannot see how I can make any significant difference from within government.'' 

His decision comes amid mounting pressure on the Conservative Party following their dismal performance in recent general elections. With little chance of reclaiming power anytime soon, many observers believe that the current crop of Conservative MPs are unlikely to secure another victory until 2025 or later. It seems clear that Mr. Hague knows full well just how difficult such a feat would be. 

Despite his resignation, however, it remains unclear exactly when and where Mr. Hague plans to take his next step. All we know for certain is that, for once, he is willing to admit that some things simply aren't meant to be. Perhaps this marks the beginning of a new chapter in his life – and who knows? Maybe someday, against all odds, he'll get his wish and become Britain's next Prime Minister.'",phi2,1

After months of speculation and an extensive internal inquiry into allegations that involved the former leader's involvement with his then lover’s family member’s visa, Mr. Blunkett stepped down from office on Tuesday evening amid mounting pressure from both inside and outside government.

It was reported by several sources close to Downing Street that Mr. Blair had personally intervened in the matter during last month's cabinet meeting to prevent Mr. Blunkett being removed as Cabinet Member for Immigration - a post which he still holds today despite his departure. This move came shortly before the launch of the independent investigation, which led to revelations surrounding what appeared to be improper dealings between the Prime Minister himself and Mr. Blunkett regarding the latter's relationship with the woman who worked as the caretaker at their shared residence. 

Despite this, Mr. Blair remains defiant over any suggestion of wrongdoing or impropriety on his part; insisting that “I made every effort within my power to keep this individual away from positions where they could misuse public funds"". In addition to his comments on this subject, the PM also expressed his regret over the situation but insisted it is important that such matters are brought out into the open and discussed rather than brushed under the rug. Speaking earlier today, Mr. Blair said:


``We should always strive towards openness when discussing difficult issues like corruption, nepotism and abuse of position of trust. We owe it to our citizens to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. I strongly believe there needs to be full transparency so we can ensure that similar situations do not arise in the future''. 

His stance comes following widespread criticism over the handling of the case thus far and calls for an immediate review and reform of current laws governing ministerial conduct. Many have argued that the existing regulations are outdated and inadequate given advances in technology making it easier for individuals to access confidential information relating to sensitive cases involving powerful figures. As such, some lawmakers argue that more stringent measures need to be implemented now in order to protect against potential abuses of authority and maintain public confidence in democratic institutions.

He emphasized the gravity of the situation by ordering a comprehensive report from independent experts. 

	Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) confirmed that the patient involved suffered from severe schizophrenia and posed significant risk due to his unpredictable behavior. Despite this knowledge, he had managed to escape while under guard. Authorities have expressed their concern over potential security breaches within the system, as they are determined to uncover any lapses or weaknesses that may have contributed to such a lapse in judgment. 

	The incident sparked immediate outrage among opposition parties, particularly those supporting the ruling party, the Scottish National Party (SNP). They argue that more stringent measures should have been implemented to prevent such incidents, highlighting the need for greater vigilance when dealing with patients diagnosed with mental illnesses. Critics believe that inadequate protocols surrounding access to high-security facilities were exploited, leading to the dangerous escape.

	Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the SNP, voiced her demand for transparency regarding who approved the release of the patient. She called upon the government to provide answers promptly, urging them to identify the individuals directly accountable for allowing him to proceed with his unrestricted movement outside the secure premises. In light of the ongoing inquiry, Ms. Sturgeon stressed the importance of accountability and ensuring that similar situations do not occur again.

Some propose increased training programs for healthcare professionals to better understand and manage complex conditions like schizophrenia. Others suggest enhanced screening processes to minimize risks associated with releasing potentially volatile inmates.

	Moving forward, the Scottish Parliament will convene to deliberate on legislative changes aimed at preventing future escapes and safeguarding both detainees and correctional officers' well-being. While no immediate decisions have been made, all stakeholders agree that addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach encompassing improvements across various sectors involved in managing psychiatric emergencies and maintaining overall inmate welfare.

The prime minister commented that he believed the current administration had taken a more thoughtful stance compared to its predecessor’s use of military might to combat global terror acts. This shift could potentially bring about better chances for peace around the globe. 

Mr Blair added that he thought it was crucial for the United States' leadership team to understand what he described as “the best prospects of peaceful co-existence lie in the universal spread of democratic principles and respect for basic civil liberties."" Such ideas were further echoed by former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she spoke out against recent attempts to weaken fundamental human rights standards in certain parts of the world. 

The UK government has long championed such ideals and made efforts to promote them through aid programs which focus primarily on helping countries develop sustainable political systems where all citizens are guaranteed equal opportunity regardless of their background or ethnicity. As well as supporting initiatives focused on economic development, the British government is committed to promoting good governance across the world and ensuring that no country ever feels neglected or excluded from important conversations taking place within intergovernmental bodies like NATO and the UN Security Council.

Rhona Brankin, Deputy Prime Minister of Scotland, announced her intention to review the original cost analysis conducted prior to deciding to implement the policy. This comes after it was reported that the research supporting the scheme had been incomplete. It appeared that some crucial information had been left out, such as potential savings from not having to pay nursing home fees or reduced hospital stays due to early discharge. 

The controversy raises questions over whether the Scottish Government had done enough to ensure the policy would remain financially viable before introducing it. It also highlights the need to better understand the full implications of any major policy change. In the end, only time will tell how the situation with the care policy in Scotland may evolve.

"The government has denied reports that Gordon Brown is planning on replacing Labor Secretary Alan Milburn before their upcoming general election. Work and Pensions Minister, Alan Johnson put out a statement saying he found such rumors “ completely false”. He added that there had been no discussion among cabinet members regarding any changes to the current leadership structure and stressed that both men would be working together towards success in this year's election. 

The rumor first started when an anonymous source within the party contacted local London newspaper The Guardian claiming that Prime Minister Brown had informed senior officials from his office of his intentions to remove Milburn and install himself or another top official in place instead. This came after months of tensions between the two leading politicians which had yet to yield a concrete result. 

However, the government quickly dismissed these claims as baseless and issued a public statement affirming that all decisions concerning the future direction of the Party are made by its elected representatives at each annual meeting. They also noted that Brown will not have access to information related to internal party discussions until then.

"UKIP MEP attacked German ‘empire’ in shocking revelation 
In an exclusive report, it has been uncovered that UK Independence Party Deputy Leader, Michael Nattrass, accused Chancellor Angela Merkel's administration of attempting to create what can only be described as an 'EMIRE'. The claim came after Mr. Nattrass claimed in an interview broadcasted over Europe 1 radio station that the European Union is more affordable compared to sending troops in tanks when dealing with conflict resolution. In his speech given prior to the recent Hartlepool By-Election, Mr. Nattras said the following regarding the use of military force within the EU;

The current political climate within the EU appears increasingly strained. With tensions rising between nations throughout the continent, there are those who fear further escalation could result in war. As such, many have taken umbrage at the suggestion from one certain Member State - namely the United Kingdom – that the EU should act as a deterrent against potential conflicts instead of relying upon armed forces.""

"Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk, an ex-BBC chat show host and former UKIP member turned independent politician announced today the creation of his political party “Veritas” which stands for Truth in Politics. Kilroy-silk believes there is currently corruption and lies at every level of government, including within the current ruling Labour party. 

``Our Country's Future Is At Risk'': The Rise Of Veritas

Robert Kilroy-Silk is no stranger to controversy, having previously been known for his outspoken views on migration policies during his time hosting his own radio talk show on the BBC. However, it wasn't until this week when he made history once again by announcing the establishment of his very own political party, Veritas. This move came after months of careful planning, research and strategizing in order to create an effective platform focused solely on the promotion of truthful and transparent governance. According to him, the main goal of Veritas will be to bring much needed reform into British politics while simultaneously tackling issues such as climate change, social justice, foreign policy and economic stability.

In addition to promoting honest representation of citizens through their elected officials, the leader also hopes to tackle some other pressing matters such as increasing access to healthcare and education opportunities across all areas of Britain. To ensure that everyone can have a voice in shaping the future direction of the nation, Kilroy-Silk plans to use innovative methods like online voting systems so that individuals don’t need to worry about long queues or inaccessible polling stations when casting their votes. Furthermore, he aims to introduce reforms concerning corporate taxes, aiming towards ensuring companies are held accountable and pay fair rates whilst still enabling them remain profitable enough to continue providing jobs throughout the country.

The launch of Veritas marks yet another significant moment in modern British politics since its inception in 1707; however this particular event may go down in history books due its sheer audacity and ambition in terms of challenging traditional notions regarding leadership roles. As the world around us continues to rapidly evolve and develop more advanced technologies than ever before, it becomes increasingly difficult for any single individual or group of people to keep up with everything happening everywhere. That’s why I believe now more than ever we should strive towards making sure democracy remains accessible for everyone regardless where they come from, what race they belong too or whether or not they identify themselves under one specific ideology. We owe it both ourselves and generations yet unborn to make certain our leaders represent each person equally without bias or prejudice whatsoever – only then can real progress occur!”

"In recent years, there have been numerous proposals for large-scale mergers between major labor unions in the United Kingdom. One such proposal is the potential combination of the American Federation of State County Municipal Employees Union (AFSCME) and the National Education Association AFL-CIO (NEA). Both organizations represent millions of workers across multiple industries, and their proposed merger has generated significant debate among politicians and business leaders alike. 

The main argument put forth by supporters of this merger is that it would create a larger and stronger voice for workers within the government. By joining forces, AFSCME and NEA hope to gain greater leverage when negotiating wages, benefits, and working conditions on behalf of their respective constituents. They argue that a united front will enable them to better advocate for policies that benefit all workers, regardless of industry or sector. Additionally, proponents contend that a merged union would bring greater efficiency and cost savings, allowing them to provide even higher levels of service to members.

Opponents of the proposed merger express concerns about the impact it could have on smaller local unions. Critics worry that a consolidation of power into one mega-union may lead to less representation and autonomy for individual districts and communities. They fear that decisions made at the national level may not accurately reflect the unique needs and priorities of each locality. Furthermore, opponents argue that merging too many powerful unions together runs the risk of reducing competition and ultimately limiting worker choice.

"Blair, dismissing any claims of his intent to step down from power ahead of the 2007 General Election. The former Prime Minister addressed allegations made by British newspaper Daily Mirror and reported in the Sunday Express that had he been informed that there was a plan to oust him, he would have resigned rather than see it take place. In response to these assertions made in the two publications, which came as part of an investigation conducted during the latter months of 2006, Blair denied all knowledge of such intentions being shared within Cabinet circles at the time when they were first put forth. “You don’t negotiate with people who are going into your head – not even close,” he stated while speaking on Radio 2's Wake Up To Money program hosted by Robert Peston on January 5th.


In light of the above conversation between former UK Prime Ministers Tony Blair (T) & Gordon Brown (B), let us consider a political scenario involving three hypothetical countries - Alpha (A), Bravo (Br), and Charlie (Ch). Each country can either be under a leader or facing instability due to a planned coup d'état attempt led by someone other than their current president but not necessarily always. 

Given the following information:
1. If A is stable then Br will also remain stable; if A becomes unstable, so does Br.
2. Either B or C is leading, but neither of them might lead due to possible internal conflicts.
3. If Ch remains under its current leadership, both A and Br won't face turmoil. But if Ch faces upheaval, A too may become chaotic.
   
Question: Assuming no change occurs initially among leaders of the aforementioned countries and given that one country already faced instability(i.e., B became ungovernable last year due to internal conflict); what could potentially happen regarding stability conditions for each respective nation?


Firstly, using deductive logic we infer from rule 3 that since one country B experienced chaos, it means another must stay unaffected because of interdependencies i.e., if B destabilized, so did not allow A to maintain its state of stability. Therefore, we conclude that only C remained calm without disruption, and thus, it doesn't affect the condition for nations B and A. 

Applying property of transitivity derived in Step 1, since A depends upon the stability of Br via rule #1, considering the established fact that A didn't go through turmoil again, the same holds true for Br. Hence, it stays stable, maintaining overall orderliness amongst these nations.

Using inductive reasoning based off our previous steps and rule #2, we know that either Br or Ch is heading. As per rule #3, if Charlie maintains her position, both B and A should remain stable. However, since we've determined that B isn't able to hold its status quo now, and considering the transitive nature of stability conditions discussed earlier (A->B->C->stable), we reach the conclusion that despite the possibility of potential upheavals, none of the nations can currently experience complete anarchy. This implies, assuming no changes occur in the future, that every nation would continue to function smoothly provided their respective leaders manage to resolve their differences.
Answer: Given the initial states of affairs where Country B faced turmoil causing unrest across others, the situation stabilizes ensuring smooth operation of the remaining nations unless drastic actions interfere with their ongoing peace process.

"The announcement by Gordon Brown, Britain's Prime Minister, sets in motion one of the most important decisions of this year—the delivery of the nation's budget. This will mark a significant date in history as it marks the first time a British budget is being held during this month, rather than typically in early spring. 

Gordon Brown is set to address the House of Commons directly from 11 am today instead of making a statement through the press like he normally does. This means he can directly answer questions from MPs and provide more clarity into the government-wide plans they have released prior to the speech. It also means there will be greater scrutiny on him and the measures he takes to improve the country's financial state.

This budget is expected to cover several key areas such as tax reform, public spending cuts, regulation, infrastructure investment, health care and education policies. It looks set to be the last major fiscal policy decision made before the general election which is due to take place later this year. With that said, experts believe that Brown must find a balance between cutting costs while still ensuring essential services are not adversely affected.

"MPs issued with BlackBerry threat, MPs face expulsion from Commons for abusing technology. The House of Commons has voted by majority to impose sanctions against Members who are found to have abused the privilege of free speech. Specifically, any MP caught using Blackberries during proceedings on the floor of the house will be reprimanded and possibly expelled from the chamber.

The policy was put into effect after several high profile incidents of improper technology usage. Alastair Campbell, a former Chief Strategy Officer of the Labour Party, inadvertently sent an expletive-laced text message to a BBC journalist while on the House phone line earlier this year. Despite numerous apologies from Mr. Campbell, the incident highlighted the potential misuse of mobile phones among Parliamentarians. 

This decision comes amid a wider trend of increasing technological advancement within the Westminster community. With the rise of social media sites and other digital communication tools, it is becoming more common for politicians to connect with constituents and each other outside of traditional parliamentary channels. However, the House of Commons has sought to address this shift by introducing a range of regulations designed to ensure that all Members adhere to proper decorum when engaging online.

In addition to banning blackberry use in the Chamber, the House of Commons also passed a motion to establish guidelines regarding email etiquette amongst MPs. These measures represent an important step towards creating a culture of respect and accountability within Britain’s political system. By enforcing stricter standards for online behavior, lawmakers hope to reduce the likelihood of future conflicts caused by irresponsible messaging and posturing.

While some critics argue that such policies are overly restrictive, many supporters view them as necessary in order to maintain trust between citizens and their representatives. As our society becomes increasingly dependent upon digital communication technologies, it is essential that our leaders model responsible conduct both offline and online. Only by upholding high standards of integrity can we build stronger relationships between government officials and those they serve. Response 1: What impact could the new rules have on the relationship between MPs and their constituents? Answer 1: If MPs comply with the new rules around technology use, then it could help to restore public confidence in elected officials' ability to act ethically and responsibly. This could lead to increased engagement with local issues, improved transparency, and better overall governance. On the other hand, failure to follow these rules might erode faith in the institution itself - undermining people's willingness to participate in democracy through voting or lobbying. Therefore, adherence to these rules represents not only good practice but an opportunity for politicians to show greater accountability than ever before! Response 2: Do you think these restrictions go too far? Why or why not? Response 2: While there may be valid concerns over whether certain regulations go overboard in terms of curtailing individual freedom and choice (especially given recent advances in digital rights management systems which allow users complete control over how information gets shared), I believe that most members should appreciate the need for boundaries in place where appropriate—particularly since abuse of power often leads directly back down lines like bullying or harassment tactics. Ultimately though, every situation must be examined closely before deciding what type of regulation makes sense –– ensuring balance so nobody loses anything unjustifiably due process/rights violations! 3 OUTPUTS IN TEXT FORM

"Political parties can no longer ignore or underestimate the potential power and influence of the grey vote, according to new research from Age Concern. 
The polling data reveals that while only one in ten (17%) aged between 18 and 24 years old say they always exercise their right to vote in an election, this figure rises significantly to two thirds (69%) among those aged 55+.""This is a clear indication that older people are much more likely to turn out to vote than younger citizens,"" commented Gordon Lishman, CEO of Age Concern.
In light of these findings, political parties must focus on engaging and appealing to this demographic in order to secure electoral success. This includes developing policies that address issues relevant to older individuals such as healthcare, retirement benefits, and social care. Additionally, campaigns should aim to reach out to elderly populations through various channels including television, radio, print media, and online platforms. By actively targeting the grey vote, political parties have the opportunity to tap into a significant source of support and ensure their representation within Parliament.
Furthermore, ageist stereotypes need to be challenged and dismantled by both politicians and society alike. The perception that older individuals are disinterested, uninformed, or incapable should be debunked. Instead, campaigns should emphasize the valuable contributions and experiences of seniors, highlighting how their voices matter in shaping public policy decisions. Through inclusive messaging and positive portrayals, political parties can build trust and credibility amongst the ageing population.
It's also crucial for parties to acknowledge and respond to the unique concerns and needs of different generations. While Millennials may prioritize environmental sustainability and digital innovation, Gen Xers may value economic stability and fiscal responsibility. By understanding these generational differences, parties can tailor their messages and proposals accordingly. This approach will enable them to effectively communicate their values and priorities to a diverse range of voters across all ages.
Moreover, efforts should be made to increase voter turnout among older adults by simplifying the registration process and removing barriers to voting. Many elderly individuals face challenges related to mobility, technology literacy, and health conditions which may prevent them from participating fully in elections. Parties should explore innovative solutions such as mail-in ballots, early voting options, and assistance programs to overcome these obstacles and make the democratic process accessible to everyone, regardless of age.
In conclusion, the upcoming general election provides an excellent opportunity for political parties to recognize and harness the power of the grey vote. With proper engagement strategies, targeted campaigning, and a commitment to addressing the specific needs of older individuals, parties can secure substantial support from this vital constituency. Failure to do so risk alienating a growing segment of the electorate and undermining the legitimacy of the democratic system itself. It's time for political leaders to understand that age diversity matters and embrace it as an asset rather than a liability. Only then can we truly represent the interests and aspirations of all members of our society, young and old alike.

"The Conservative Party has announced its plan to eliminate 162 quangos in an attempt to reduce waste and increase efficiency in government operations. This move comes as no surprise, given that the party has long been advocating for reducing bureaucratic layers in the government and improving transparency. 

The parties leading policy of cutting quangos from the public sector first came up with the idea several years ago. Since then, they've released numerous documents outlining their goals in detail. The conservative manifesto specifically mentions saving £4.3 billion by eliminating unnecessary quangs, while also creating six new bodies to take their place. These new bodies will focus on governance and regulation, such as an independent assessor of university performance and drug-testing agencies. 

One of the main reasons behind this policy is to decrease government spending. With over 400 quangos currently operating in the UK, there's clearly many opportunities for excess bureaucracy. In addition, critics argue that some quangos serve little or no purpose, making it an inefficient use of resources. By getting rid of redundant quangos, the government aims to make spending more productive and timely.

Moreover, the Conservative Party believes that the elimination of quangos will help improve communication between different departments and lessen corruption within government organizations. For example, the creation of the Independent Assessor of University Performance will help monitor the progress Universities made to improvement student satisfaction rates. This will ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and efficiently, rather than being wasted on ineffective policies.

Despite some criticism of the policy, most people agree that reducing wasteful bureaucracy should be an priority for the government. With the implementation of the Conservative Party's plan, Canada has the potential to become a world leader in transparent governance and efficient public administration.

"The Tories have pledged an unprecedented initiative to boost participation in sport among British children. Under their new club2school program, children will receive access to six weeks of weekly sport sessions from various clubs around Britain, at no cost. 

The news has been welcomed by many politicians and sporting authorities alike, who underline the importance of physical activity for children's development. A former Conservative MP, Robert Taylor, commented that this was a great step forward for the country, and that it could help reduce obesity levels and foster social cohesion. 

The party also plans to increase funding for sports clubs across the nation – particularly those located in rural areas – as well as providing more resources for coaches and mentors. This should ensure that all pupils have access to quality sport programs regardless of their background or geographical location. 

The Conservatives have made it clear that they want to make sport accessible to everyone, regardless of age or ability. By offering more time and support for children and young people, they believe that we can create a healthier and happier society. 

The prime minister himself has expressed his enthusiasm for the scheme, saying that “it”s vital that every child gets the chance to enjoy the benefits of sport. With so many benefits associated with playing sports - both physically and mentally - this is an initiative that could benefit us all. 

So far, there have been few details released regarding how the plan will actually work in practice – such as which schools and clubs will participate, or what kind of activities will take place during each session. However, one thing is certain: the Tories are committed to making sure that our youth have access to high-quality sports opportunities. 

This commitment to boosting physical education comes amid growing concerns over childhood obesity rates, which remain alarmingly high despite decades of public health campaigns. According to recent statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 40 million children worldwide were overweight or obese in 2016, with Western countries like the United States leading the way. 

It remains to be seen whether the Tories' initiative will be enough to turn the tide against rising obesity figures — but one thing is clear: giving children greater access to sports facilities and programs could go a long way towards helping combat this problem.

"The day is long, the sky's blue
And I'm feeling good as new
I've got my thoughts in line, I'm thinking ""Bout Time,""
To make some sense out of this life.

Gonna take a deep breath, no stress
Just clear away all the dust in my mind
Come on John Lennon, let's sing along
All we need is love, and peace all around.


Let us consider five people involved in political discussions related to the paragraph above - Gordon Brown (GB), Thabo Mbeki (TB), Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete (TPK) who signed the loan agreement (TPA), and the representative from the Overseas Development Institute (ODO). 

Each person either supports or opposes the idea of apologizing for the UK's colonial past, each holds one of four viewpoints namely: Strongly Supports (SS), Moderates (M), Opposes (O), and Indeterminate (ID). No two persons hold exactly the same viewpoint nor can they have the exact opposite viewpoints.

Here are your clues:

1. GB neither strongly supports not opposes the concept.
2. TB does not oppose the concept but someone else does. 
3. TPA doesn't support the concept.
4. ODO has an opposing viewpoint to GB. 
5. Someone other than TB and TPA supports the concept.
6. Only one person moderates their position towards the topic.
7. At least three individuals have indeterminate positions.

Question: What stance do each individual hold regarding the issue?


Start by creating a 5x5 table where each column represents a different individual and each row represents one possible viewpoint. Label them accordingly SS, M, O, ID. Fill up known facts based on clue 1 & 4, then use deductive reasoning through clues 2 & 3 to fill more cells. This will lead you to know that GB must be moderating his opinion because he cannot oppose (clue 6) so therefore GB = M. Now only the views of TB and TPA remain. Since TPA didn’t support the concept according to clue 3, it leaves TB supporting (S) because someone else did (clues 5 & 7) leaving TPA to be opposed (O). Then finally assign ID status to GB because at minimum there needs to be one indecisive party (Clue 7) hence GB = ID.
By process of elimination (proof by exhaustion) and using inductive logic, since everyone else now knows what their stance is except for TPK who hasn‘t been assigned any yet, TPK has to be oppositional too. Therefore, assign ID status again to TPK. Also assigning SS status to ODO as per Clue 7. Lastly, remaining undecided is represented by ID for ODO. 
Answer: Thus, the stances held respectively are:
   Gordon Brown – Moderate
  Thabo Mbeki      – Support
Tanzanian President Jakayako Kikwete – Oppose
Representative from Overseas Development Institution     – Indeterminate

"The decision by Atrium Healthcare, an English hospital group operating four hospitals including one based at Royal Wrekin College Hospital near Shrewsbury, is seen as a positive step towards improving patient care. 

Atrium’s move comes after weeks of pressure being placed on the NHS by Welsh health officials. The policy was introduced last month and created huge controversy during its implementation. Many healthcare professionals worried it would lead to inequality in access to treatment, with Welsh citizens potentially facing delays in accessing life-saving procedures. 

While health authorities have made efforts to reassure the public of their commitment to providing quality care across both nations of the UK, many remain unconvinced. The suspension of the policy is therefore welcomed by many as a sign that the government is taking decisive action to address the concerns raised by the medical community.

"The political climate was tense and filled with controversy. The recent proposal by Conservative Party Leader, Michael Howard, to impose quota restrictions on refugees seeking asylum sparked heated debate among politicians and citizens alike. In a move to defend his position, Howard turned to former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair for support. However, even this alliance proved insufficient as more voices spoke out against the idea. Immigration minister David Blunkett expressed his disapproval, stating that it seemed like a desperate attempt to gain favor amongst voters rather than genuine compassion towards those seeking refuge. As tensions continued to rise, Howard found himself facing criticism not just within his own party but also internationally. This prompted him to take drastic measures - he launched into the world of tabloid journalism by writing articles attacking journalists who opposed the quota plan, including renowned figures such as George Monbiot, Polly Toynbee, and John Bercow, the MP who had previously criticized the proposed legislation. It became increasingly clear that the situation surrounding immigration and refugee policies had escalated beyond what anyone could have anticipated. Amidst all this chaos, another significant development occurred when Home Secretary Jack Straw announced his resignation amidst mounting pressure due to allegations related to expenses fraud at the Ministry of Defence. These events further intensified the already volatile atmosphere, making it difficult to find any common ground or solutions to address the pressing issue of immigration reform.

"The next chapter of political history has been ushered in, marked not only by an exciting new era but one that may very well determine the future of our world. With this comes both hope and trepidation; hope because it signifies progress towards equality and justice, yet apprehension since the stakes have never been so high. Prime Minister Gordon Brown must take charge now, leading us forward into a better tomorrow. He needs to outline his vision – his goals for the next four years – and how each step aligns with the bigger picture. This way, we can hold him accountable and ensure the message is clear: this is your government’s chance to shape global policy. 

Gordon Brown's primary goal should be to foster strong relationships with European Union leaders during the country's chairmanship at the G7 summit later this month. It is crucial that the prime minister works alongside other leaders to promote economic growth through shared solutions and mutual understanding. Additionally, Britain must continue its long-standing commitment to international aid, working tirelessly over the course of this parliament to double funding given to developing countries. This extra financial support could prove invaluable in reducing poverty levels across the globe. In order to achieve this ambitious target, the British government must work closely with the United States to encourage all donors to join them in their efforts. 

Furthermore, Brown needs to prioritize addressing climate change and implementing green initiatives within Europe. By setting a positive example, other member states are sure to follow suit. Achieving this milestone requires extensive cooperation between governments and environmental organizations alike; no single nation can tackle such a large-scale problem alone. We need a united front if any significant headway is going to be made. 

To further advance these causes, the UK must also focus on creating sustainable business practices which reduce pollution while simultaneously providing jobs. These measures would help stimulate economies worldwide, ensuring a more stable future for everyone involved. Ultimately, Brown needs to demonstrate real leadership throughout this period – inspiring citizens back home while encouraging collaboration among those who wield the most power around the world stage. Only then can true change begin to occur.

He stressed the need to ensure that all citizens have access to high-quality medical care, regardless of their financial situation or location. He acknowledged the successes of the National Health Service (NHS) in the past 50 years, noting that it was a major achievement which must not be taken for granted.
Thirdly, Brown focused on promoting social justice and equality. He expressed his commitment to tackling poverty and inequality through policies such as raising the minimum wage, improving housing conditions, and expanding access to affordable childcare. Brown also noted the importance of providing support for vulnerable groups, including children, disabled people, and elderly individuals. 
Finally, Brown called attention to the environment and the urgent need to address climate change. He urged government, industry, and civil society to work together to develop sustainable solutions and reduce carbon emissions. Brown recognized that protecting the planet is crucial not only for present generations but also for those who will come after us.

"Political parties can no longer ignore the vast array of opinions from older citizens when crafting their political platforms. Older people are now playing an increasingly significant role in British politics, with many choosing to cast their ballot in elections despite being retired. 

The latest census data shows that the population of those aged 65 and above is increasing rapidly; by 2041 one third of the population will be elderly. With this in mind, politicians need to start designing policies which reflect the needs of this growing demographic. 

It's clear that younger generations, such as those aged 18 to 24, have different priorities to those of seniors. For example, older individuals are more likely to prioritize health care, affordable housing and access to public services. In contrast, millennials may be more concerned with tackling climate change or digital innovation.

Older citizens should also be actively involved in shaping policy debates. This means creating forums where their views can be easily heard, and ensuring their voices are properly represented in decision-making processes.

Finally, political parties must focus on reaching out to older voters during the upcoming election. This could involve using traditional media, such as radio and TV advertising, as well as targeting younger demographics through social media and other online channels. By engaging with older citizens and addressing their concerns, the next government will be better equipped to make decisions which benefit all members of society.

"The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir William Hague has announced that he is retiring from political office. 

Mr Hague's decision to step away from the role comes following what was seen as one of the most successful stints in British political history. During his time in power, he saw success in reducing taxes, cutting government spending and promoting global trade. He also made waves with his ambitious policies on international relations and foreign aid. 

Despite this impressive record, it seems Mr Hague is looking beyond politics to pursue other interests. He said he was finding the current state of politics to be ""too dull"", indicating that he felt there were more fulfilling activities he could be engaging in. For now at least, he appears content to take back some much-needed personal time and explore new hobbies. 

In addition, Lord Hague will no longer be standing for re-election as Party Chairman, suggesting he has had enough of official politics altogether. It remains to be seen whether he will have any further involvement in political affairs in the future. 

His resignation follows a long and tumultuous period during which he faced numerous challenges while trying to make positive changes to Britain. Despite this, he remains committed to maintaining close relationships with those in power and will likely continue to influence policy and public opinion in the coming years. 

Many are left wondering what will become of Britain without its once-beloved leader, but only time will tell. The departure of such a influential figure makes for intriguing times, and many are eager to see how the country develops under its new stewardship.

Households in England have been warned that they could avoid prosecution if an intruder injures them, as long as their actions can be deemed “honest and instinctive.” In such cases, homeowners will no longer face legal repercussions for using whatever is within reach of their hands—even weapons like knives and baseball bats (source). 
The move comes after recent reports of burglaries and robberies where residents felt threatened enough to fight back against their attackers. Many victims said the fear of being charged under outdated laws prevented some from defending themselves properly, leaving them defenseless when attacked again at a later date (source). 
These latest developments follow on from similar initiatives introduced earlier this year aimed specifically at protecting citizens from malicious attacks carried out by criminals intent upon stealing property without consequence — including increased penalties for offenders caught breaking into homes unlawfully; harsher sentences handed down during trial proceedings related directly tied back towards unlawful activities committed inside residential areas throughout England & Wales over time",phi2,1
"The world's focus remains firmly planted on the ever-growing threat posed by global warming. As such, leaders from around the globe are joining forces to tackle this pressing issue. In spite of recent setbacks with the US’ refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Prime Minister Blair continues to push for comprehensive climate legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
During his visit to Washington last week, British Senator John McCain highlighted the urgency of finding solutions to combat climate change. He made it clear that he shares the same sentiments as many other countries when it comes to protecting the environment. “Climate change is one of the most significant challenges we face today, and I am committed to working towards effective policies that can mitigate its effects,” McCain stated. With both the United States and Britain taking the lead at this pivotal moment in history, there is hope that meaningful agreements will be reached soon.
Despite efforts to make headway on creating sustainable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions, the road ahead still poses numerous obstacles. The transition to green technology requires substantial investment – something not all nations possess. Furthermore, some governments continue to prioritize economic growth over environmental preservation– resulting in increased pollution levels. This raises important questions concerning how long until our planet reaches irreversible damage if action does not take place immediately.
While President Bush may refuse to accept the scientific consensus behind climate change, leading environmentalists like Bill Clinton remain adamant about tackling this problem head-on. It seems likely that future presidents will build upon the successes of their predecessors, continuing the fight against global warming even without formal support from every nation. After all, no country can truly afford to ignore what could very well become its worst nightmare come true - an uninhabitable earth.",phi2,1
"The two politicians had an unexpected reunion as they both arrived in Sheffield for the same reason. This time, however, it was not an official affair; rather, it was merely a chance encounter that will likely change their lives forever. 

David Blunkett, the former home secretary, arrived first, dressed impeccably in a tailored black suit and white shirt. Onlookers couldn't help but admire how dapper the politician looked even after all this years since his last outing. It seemed like nothing could bring him down from such poise.

Soon enough, Blair came along. His arrival made quite a stir among those gathered around him – some were taken aback by the presence of someone who has been out of sight for so long while others welcomed him warmly. Either way, there wasn’t any denying the fact that the atmosphere quickly changed when the two powerful men crossed paths.

 Blair and Blunkett spent almost an hour catching up and discussing recent events. They talked of old times and new ideas. Both expressed admiration towards each other's success during their absence. However, neither wanted to talk about why exactly they decided to meet here today. Despite knowing the answer within themselves, no one dared to speak out loud.

When the sun started setting, it was clear that the conversation must end soon. With a heavy heart, Blair bid farewell to Blunkett before heading off into the night. Little did either man know that their meeting tonight would have lasting consequences on both of them…

"David Blunkett, former Home Secretary of Great Britain, has revealed that he longed for marriage with published author Kimberly Quinn. This comes after years away from her due to their tumultuous relationship.

In an exclusive one on one interview with BBC Newsnight, Blunkett expressed how deeply he loved her, despite the difficulties they faced as couple, saying “It’s complicated. It brought tears to my eyes when I read your obituary last week…I am still grieving over it.” Despite this sadness, Blunkett proudly proclaimed himself to be a strong supporter of personal responsibility; something he believes every individual should take ownership of. 

The former politician went on to state his current situation — he has taken legal measures against Kimberly Quinn so that he may have physical custody of their 2 year old boy. He claimed she had denied him visitation rights even though he has been legally granted them. The court is currently deliberating upon the case while both parties are waiting anxiously for its outcome. 

This announcement brings forth a multitude of emotions within Blunkett's inner circle of family and friends. Many who knew him well were astonished at the courage he demonstrated by speaking out publicly about his feelings for Kimberly Quinn, given the controversy surrounding their relationship. In spite of their disagreements, there remain some loyalists among those close to the politician who continue to show their support for his stance on matters such as personal responsibility. 

Only time will tell if Blunkett and Quinn can reconcile or not, yet his willingness to openly express his sentiments reveals a side of the man few saw before. As many watch and wait to see what happens next, one thing is certain: David Blunkett remains devoted to defending his beliefs regardless of the obstacles thrown in his way.

Article 1: Richard Thomas, the former Information Commissioner for England and Wales has criticized the recent decision by the government to delete emails in order to avoid them being made public under freedom of information (FOI) laws. In an interview, he expressed his strong opposition to this move, stating that it goes against the principles of transparency and openness. He argued that emails should not be deleted unless there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when they are no longer needed for any current purpose. According to him, the government's guidance on FOI regulations should emphasize the importance of preserving these records in order to ensure accountability and promote trust between citizens and their elected representatives. Thomas also urged the government to reconsider its position on this matter and work towards finding a more effective solution that would respect the rights of citizens while ensuring compliance with FOI laws.

Article 2: The controversy surrounding the deletion of emails by the government has been met with mixed reactions from different quarters. While some have praised the move, arguing that it will help protect sensitive information and maintain national security, others have expressed concern over its impact on transparency and democracy. Richard Thomas, who was once responsible for upholding FOI regulations in the UK, has been particularly critical of the decision. He has called on the government to provide clear justification for its actions and demonstrate a commitment to maintaining high standards of transparency and accountability in all areas of governance. Thomas believes that the public has a right to know how decisions are made and what factors influence those decisions, especially when they involve matters of significant public interest or potential harm to individuals and communities.

Article 3: The debate over the deletion of emails by the government has taken another twist with the intervention of Richard Thomas. Thomas has accused the government of undermining the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which aims to promote transparency and access to information held by public bodies. He argues that the deletion of emails without proper justification can lead to a culture of secrecy and lack of accountability, which can erode public confidence in institutions. Moreover, Thomas believes that the government's approach to FOI regulations fails to recognize the value of historical documents as evidence of past policies and practices, which can be used to inform future decisions and hold officials accountable for their actions. Thomas calls on the government to adopt a more proactive and transparent approach to managing electronic records and to engage in meaningful consultation with civil society organizations before making any changes to existing regulations.

In conclusion, the issue of email deletion by the government remains highly controversial and subject to intense scrutiny. With the FOI laws set to come into effect on 1st January, many are concerned that this move could lead to a culture of secrecy and lack of accountability. Richard Thomas, the former Information Commissioner for England and Wales, has strongly condemned the decision, calling on the government to adhere to the principles of transparency and openness and to work towards finding a more effective solution that balances the need for protecting sensitive information with the rights of citizens to access information. It remains to be seen how the government will respond to these concerns and whether they will be able to strike the delicate balance required in today's digital age.",mistral7b,1

Patricia Hewitt's announcement that the UK will be investing more money into women's equality initiatives has sparked excitement among many. According to Ms Hewitt, this investment is not only necessary for economic growth but also crucial in achieving long-term social goals. She stated that the cost of these proposals is currently under evaluation, but they are becoming increasingly important as shared priorities across the government.

Ms Hewitt spoke at a gender and productivity seminar hosted by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), emphasizing the importance of women's participation in the workforce. She pointed out that despite recent progress, there is still much work to be done to ensure that all women have equal opportunities and access to education, training, and employment. The EOC echoed her sentiments, stating that women continue to face discrimination and unequal treatment in both private and public sectors, which hinders their ability to achieve full potential.

One of the most significant challenges faced by women today is balancing family life with demanding careers. Ms Hewitt acknowledged this challenge and announced that new measures would be implemented to help working mothers balance their responsibilities. This includes flexible working arrangements, increased parental leave, and affordable childcare options. These changes, she believes, will not only benefit families but also boost the economy by increasing female labor force participation rates.

The proposed investments will also focus on promoting diversity and inclusion in leadership positions. Ms Hewitt stressed that businesses need diverse perspectives to make informed decisions and remain competitive. To address this issue, she outlined plans to increase the number of women in executive roles, promote diversity in recruitment processes, and create mentoring programs to help women advance in their careers.

In addition to workplace equality, Ms Hewitt highlighted the need to tackle gender inequality in other areas such as healthcare and education. She noted that women often experience different health issues than men and may require specific care and support. Similarly, girls may be held back from reaching their full potential due to biased educational curricula or lack of role models. To address these challenges, she promised to invest in research to better understand gender differences and develop targeted interventions to improve outcomes for women.

Overall, Ms Hewitt's announcements were met with enthusiasm and optimism by attendees of the EOC seminar. Many expressed hope that these initiatives would lead to lasting change and greater equality for women. As Ms Hewitt put it, ""we can only succeed if we truly embrace diversity, and that starts with recognizing that women's contributions matter."" With continued efforts like these, it seems that the future of women's equality in the UK is bright.",mistral7b,1

Political parties are always looking for new ways to engage their members and attract new supporters. One way they do this is through large-scale events, such as conferences, rallies, and marches. These events provide an opportunity for political leaders to connect with their base and lay out their plans for the future.

One example of a party making a change in tradition when it comes to hosting its annual conference is Labour. For many years, the party has held its conference on the coast, at venues like Brighton or Blackpool. However, this year, things were different. The much-trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) in a break with tradition. Instead of heading to the sea, the NEC chose Manchester as the location for the annual event.

This decision marks the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host its conference. This move could be seen as a sign that the party wants to appeal more to urban voters and show support for cities outside of London. Some have also suggested that the move reflects Labour's growing focus on issues like housing, transportation, and jobs, which are all important concerns for people living in cities.

Whether or not this move pays off for Labour remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain - the party is taking steps to modernize and adapt to changing times, and that's something that can only be good for democracy.",mistral7b,1

""Labour leader Ed Miliband has been criticized for being too cautious on the economy during the general election campaign. Some critics say that by not committing to a spending spree, he is failing to appeal to voters who are looking for change and growth. However, former chief economic adviser to the Treasury Ed Balls argues that such a stance could actually prove beneficial for Labour in the long run.

According to Mr Balls, it is important for political parties to show responsibility when it comes to managing public finances. He believes that by adhering to strict fiscal rules, Labour can demonstrate its commitment to stability and responsible governance. This, he says, will help build trust with voters and give them confidence in the party's ability to handle their financial affairs.

However, Mr Balls also acknowledges that the current economic climate presents challenges for both political parties. With unemployment rates high and many people feeling the pinch of reduced living standards, there may be pressure on politicians to make promises they cannot keep. Nevertheless, he insists that this does not mean Labour should abandon its principles of sound management and prudent expenditure.

Instead, Mr Balls suggests that Labour should focus on investing in infrastructure projects and other initiatives that can stimulate job creation and drive growth in key sectors of the economy. By doing so, he believes, Labour can create a more positive environment for business and attract new investment from abroad.

Despite these challenges, Mr Balls remains optimistic about Labour's prospects at the upcoming general election. He points out that under Mr Cameron's leadership, the UK economy has grown steadily since 2010, although there have been setbacks along the way. He believes that with careful management and strategic investments, Labour can build upon this foundation and create an even stronger and more prosperous country.

In conclusion, Ed Balls' views on economics offer a nuanced perspective on how political parties should approach the delicate balancing act between responsible stewardship of public resources and bold action to promote growth and jobs. While others may see caution as weakness, Mr Balls argues that it can ultimately lead to greater success in the long term. As the election looms closer, it will be interesting to see whether Mr Miliband takes this advice to heart and whether Labour can deliver on its promises while maintaining its reputation for responsible government.""",mistral7b,1

1. The report revealed that there was a lack of transparency in the decision-making process surrounding the Millennium dome, as too many parties had influence over its operations and sales after it initially opened.
2. A new study found that the cost of maintaining and selling the dome skyrocketed to an astonishing 28.7 million pounds within just four years after it shut down.
3. The NAO criticized the government for their handling of the dome's closure, stating that they did not do enough to ensure that the dome would be sold at a reasonable price and that all costs associated with maintenance and marketing were properly accounted for.
4. Despite initial success during the Millennium celebration, the dome struggled to make money and attract visitors once the festivities came to an end.
5. Many people have expressed dissatisfaction with the way the dome was managed and operated throughout its existence, citing high prices and poor customer service as major issues.
6. In addition to financial difficulties, the dome also faced criticism from environmental groups due to concerns about the impact of construction and operation on local ecosystems.
7. The NAO's findings highlight the need for greater oversight and scrutiny in future large-scale projects involving public funds, in order to avoid similar mistakes and protect taxpayer dollars.
8. Some experts believe that the dome's failure serves as a cautionary tale for other cities looking to build similar attractions in the future.
9. However, supporters argue that the dome's legacy will live on through its contributions to British culture and tourism, despite its financial struggles.
10. Ultimately, the fate of the Millennium dome remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the lessons learned from this controversial project are unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:
The Conservative Party has been hit by a damaging attack from former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who accused them of offering a ""hard right agenda"". The criticism came as Labour leader Ed Miliband launched a major policy speech attacking the Tories on issues such as healthcare and education.
Labour MPs were briefed ahead of the speech that Mr Blair would be launching a scathing attack on David Cameron's government. They were told that he believed the Tories had taken the country backwards since they took power in 2010, citing cuts to services and rising poverty levels.
In his speech, Mr Blair said he was disappointed by the direction that the Tories were taking the country, particularly their plans to cut funding for public services such as the NHS. He also criticised their record on education, saying that they were failing young people by not investing enough in schools.
However, it wasn't just Mr Blair who made waves during the speeches. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox responded to Mr Blair's comments by accusing him of lying about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" This comment is likely to further inflame tensions between the two parties and add fuel to ongoing debates about the decision to invade Iraq.
Article 2:
The Conservative Party has been under fire again today following comments from former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In an interview with Sky News, Mr Blair attacked the current government's handling of the economy and said that he believed they should have done more to stimulate growth.
He also criticised the Tories for cutting too much too fast, saying that this approach was hurting the poorest in society. Mr Blair added that he felt vindicated by recent data showing that unemployment figures were falling, but that he still believed there was more work to be done to get the economy back on track.
Meanwhile, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has continued to defend the government's economic policies. In a statement released earlier today, he said that he believed that Britain needed to continue on its path towards lower deficits and higher growth rates. Dr Fox argued that this would ultimately lead to better outcomes for everyone, including those who were struggling to find jobs.
Despite these efforts to defend the government's position, the debate over whether or not the UK is doing enough to support economic growth continues to rage. With many experts warning that slow progress could lead to even deeper recession, the pressure is mounting on policymakers to come up with a plan to kickstart the economy once and for all.
Article 3:
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has delivered another devastating blow to the Conservative Party. In a letter to party donors, he accused David Cameron of abandoning his promises to reform the welfare state.
Blair wrote that while he agreed with many of the principles behind Cameron's welfare reforms, he feared that they would end up being watered down due to political pressures. He cited concerns that vulnerable groups such as the disabled and elderly might be left worse off as a result of changes to benefits.
Cameron's spokesperson quickly rejected Blair's claims, insisting that the prime minister had always been clear about his commitment to reforming the welfare system. However, the row is unlikely to ease any tension between the two men and comes as the Conservatives face increasing scrutiny over their social policy proposals.
Elsewhere, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has been forced to apologise for using language that some saw as offensive. Following a heated exchange with a journalist during a radio interview yesterday, Fox admitted that he may have chosen his words poorly. He promised to work harder to communicate clearly and effectively in future.
Fox's apology will do little to quell growing unease within the Conservative Party, however. Many activists feel that the party needs to change its message if it wants to win back voters who feel disillusioned with the government. As Blair's latest attack demonstrates, the battle lines are drawn and both sides seem prepared to fight tooth and nail until the next general election.",mistral7b,1

1. The behavior of male MPs in the House of Commons has been called into question by a report from researchers at Birkbeck College. It emerged that during certain debates, MPs would pretend to juggle imaginary breasts while jeering ""melons"" at female speakers. This behavior is believed to be part of an ongoing problem within parliament where sexism and discrimination continue to persist despite efforts to stamp them out.
2. One woman who experienced this firsthand is Labour's Yvette Cooper. She revealed that when she was appointed as a minister, she found it incredibly difficult to convince Commons officials that she was qualified for her role. Despite presenting her credentials, they continued to treat her like a secretary rather than a politician. This treatment only served to reinforce existing gender stereotypes within parliament and discouraged other women from pursuing careers in politics.
3. Ms. Cooper went on to call for greater transparency and accountability within government. ""It's time we had real change,"" she said. ""We need to address the culture of sexism and discrimination that still exists within our institutions. Only then can we truly achieve equality and respect for all members of society."" Her comments echoed those of many others who have spoken out against the rampant sexism and misogyny within politics.
4. Meanwhile, Conservative MPs faced criticism over their handling of the Grenfell Tower fire disaster. A damning report from the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee accused them of downplaying the severity of the situation and failing to take action quickly enough. The committee also criticized the government for not providing adequate support for the victims and survivors of the fire. These findings are likely to have serious consequences for the Tories in upcoming elections.
5. In response to these criticisms, Prime Minister Theresa May issued a statement expressing sympathy for the families affected by the tragedy. However, critics argued that her words were empty without concrete action. They pointed out that many people are still struggling to find safe accommodation and receive the help they need to recover from the trauma of losing their homes and loved ones.
6. Amidst all of this political turmoil, there was some positive news on the horizon for women's rights advocates. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its annual World Economic Outlook, which included a special section on gender equality. According to the IMF, countries that promote gender equality tend to experience faster economic growth, lower poverty rates, and better health outcomes. By closing the gap between men and women, nations could unlock significant potential and create more prosperous societies for everyone.",mistral7b,1

Politics is a game of spin, and few people know this better than Alistair Campbell. The former communications director for Tony Blair has long been accused of using underhanded tactics to promote himself and the government he served, and on Wednesday, he found himself at the center of another controversy. Mr Campbell had been trying to negotiate an appearance on BBC2's Newsnight program when he accidentally sent them an email meant only for a journalist friend who was critical of the Labour Party's recent poster campaign.

In the email, Mr Campbell made several incriminating statements about his involvement in the creation of the posters, including allegations that they were designed to appeal specifically to young voters. These comments sparked outrage from critics who saw them as further evidence of Labour's manipulation of public opinion through advertising.

When he realized what had happened, Mr Campbell quickly tried to backtrack his statement. In an email to Newsnight, he said that the original message had been intended for a private conversation and that he had no intention of making any official announcements. However, his efforts seemed to be too little too late. By then, the story had already gone viral online, and many viewers felt betrayed by their favorite news program for allowing such a high-profile guest onto their airwaves.

The incident also raised questions about how journalists can effectively vet potential guests before inviting them onto their shows. Many have criticized the media for being too eager to give a platform to politicians without properly fact-checking their claims or holding them accountable for their actions. As a result, there may now be increased pressure on broadcasters to take greater care in selecting their guests and ensuring that they are genuine, unbiased sources.

Despite the uproar caused by the incident, Mr Campbell remains a popular figure among many in British politics. He has always been known for his aggressive PR campaigns and willingness to take risks in order to achieve his goals. Some see him as a masterful strategist who knows exactly how to manipulate the media to get what he wants. Others view him as an opportunistic politician who will stop at nothing to advance his own career. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, one thing is clear: Mr Campbell's influence over the political landscape cannot be ignored.",mistral7b,1

In addition, the article notes that the government is continuing its efforts to combat terrorism and protect citizens from harm. It highlights recent legislation passed to strengthen anti-terror laws and measures being taken to improve security at airports and other key locations.
Overall, the article presents a balanced view of the issue, acknowledging both the suffering caused by terrorism and the efforts being made to prevent it. While there may be disagreements over how best to address this complex problem, the prime minister's apology serves as a reminder of the importance of justice and fairness in any legal proceedings.",mistral7b,1

In recent years, Australia has seen a growing number of politicians who have made controversial statements regarding immigration policies. One such politician is John Howard, who served as Prime Minister for over a decade and was known for his tough stance on immigration. In a new BBC documentary called ""No More Mr Nasty"", Mr Howard discusses his views on immigration and the role it plays in Australian society.

The documentary delves into Mr Howard's life story, highlighting his humble beginnings in London before moving to Australia. He talks about how his parents were forced to flee Europe after witnessing firsthand the devastation caused by World War II, and how they were able to start new lives down under. However, he also expresses concern about the current state of migration in Australia, arguing that there are too many people coming in from countries that do not share our values.

""I think we need to be careful about what we're saying because you can't say anything that might give any sort of encouragement,"" Mr Howard said in the documentary. ""If you're saying you can't become prime minister if you've got a foreign accent or whatever, then that's wrong. That's just not true. But I think we need to be very clear: we want people to assimilate into this culture.""

One topic that comes up frequently in the conversation is the idea of a meritocracy when it comes to leadership positions in government. Mr Howard believes that anyone who wants to be leader should go through a rigorous selection process based solely on their qualifications and abilities, regardless of where they came from. This sentiment is shared by many other politicians in Australia, including former PM Tony Abbott, who recently expressed similar sentiments in a speech at a university in Sydney.

However, others argue that a pure meritocracy may overlook talented individuals simply because of their background. For example, Dr Khalilah Muhammad Yusuf, an academic who studies migration and citizenship, argues that cultural factors should play a role in political appointments. She believes that leaders from diverse backgrounds can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table, which can ultimately benefit the country as a whole.

Despite these differing opinions, Mr Howard remains committed to his vision for a more inclusive Australian society. He believes that immigrants can make valuable contributions to the community if given the chance to participate fully. However, he also emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong national identity and cultural values.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate surrounding immigration policies highlights the complex issues facing Australia today. While Mr Howard's concerns about the impact of immigration on Australian society are valid, others argue that a more nuanced approach is needed to ensure that all Australians feel valued and included. As the country continues to grapple with these challenges, it will be important to listen to different voices and perspectives in order to find a solution that works for everyone.",mistral7b,1

1. The Conservative Party has proposed a controversial amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Bill that could delay its passage into law until after the general election in May. The Tories argued that the legislation was too draconian and needed further scrutiny before being enacted. However, their proposal was rejected by the government, who insisted that the bill was necessary for protecting national security.
2. In another development related to the Anti-Terrorism Bill, Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended his decision to introduce house arrest for suspected terrorists as part of the legislation. According to him, this measure is not only legal but also effective in preventing terrorist activities. He added that such measures are temporary and will be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain proportionate and effective.
3. Meanwhile, opposition politicians have criticized the government's move to allow police access to financial records of individuals without a warrant under the Anti-Terrorism Bill. They fear that this power can lead to widespread abuse of civil liberties. Some MPs even called on the prime minister to resign over what they perceived as an attack on individual freedoms.
4. As the debate continues over the Anti-Terrorism Bill, it seems unlikely that any significant changes will be made before it goes through its final stages in the House of Commons. This means that the legislation could become law within weeks, despite growing concerns from civil society groups and opposition parties.
5. One of the most contentious issues surrounding the Anti-Terrorism Bill remains the question of whether it will actually prevent terrorist attacks. Critics argue that the measures outlined in the bill are too focused on punishing those who have already committed crimes rather than preventing future incidents. Others say that the bill provides the necessary tools for law enforcement agencies to tackle the threat posed by extremist groups.
6. Amidst all these debates, one thing is clear: the Anti-Terrorism Bill remains a highly divisive issue, with different sides arguing for different approaches to dealing with the threat of terrorism. Whether it ultimately proves effective or not, it is likely that the bill will continue to shape political discourse for years to come.",mistral7b,1

G7 leaders agree to debt relief for poorer nations
By: [Your Name]
Date: 2019-06-06
Source: BBC News

A major breakthrough has been reached by the Group of Eight (G8) nations as they agreed to provide debt relief for some of their poorest members, potentially saving them billions of pounds each year. This historic accord follows intense negotiations among the world's wealthiest nations and marks a significant step towards addressing global poverty and inequality.

Under the terms of the agreement, affected countries will be granted greater flexibility over how they repay their debts, allowing them to focus more resources on essential services such as healthcare and education. The deal is expected to benefit countries like Sri Lanka, Zambia, and Ukraine, which are currently facing severe financial difficulties.

According to officials involved in the discussions, the agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries £3bn pounds a year. This significant reduction in debt burden will enable these countries to invest more heavily in development projects and improve the lives of millions of people living in extreme poverty.

While some critics argue that this move may not go far enough in tackling global economic disparities, many experts view it as an important first step towards creating a fairer and more equitable world order. With ongoing negotiations between G8 leaders and other international organizations, hopes remain high that further progress can be made towards reducing poverty and promoting sustainable growth across the globe.",mistral7b,1

Prince Edward to Join UK Delegation in Poland for Holocaust Remembrance Day

Buckingham Palace announced today that Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex, will be joining the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on January 27th. This day marks the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at this infamous site during World War II.

The announcement was made by Buckingham Palace as part of its efforts to commemorate the anniversary of one of history's darkest moments. The prince has been a longtime advocate for Holocaust education and remembrance and has visited numerous sites associated with the tragedy, including Auschwitz itself. His presence at the event is seen as an important gesture of solidarity and respect for those who perished in the camps.

In addition to Prince Edward, other dignitaries expected to attend the ceremony include Polish President Andrzej Duda and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It is hoped that their attendance will serve as a powerful reminder of the need to never forget the lessons of history and to continue working towards a world where all people can live free from fear and discrimination.",mistral7b,1

Political leaders across Scotland have been criticized for downplaying the severity of the country's alcohol addiction problem after a high-profile politician made controversial comments on social media.

The controversy began when former Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell posted a message on Twitter that suggested the media coverage of binge drinking in Scotland was exaggerated and that the issue was being used as a scapegoat for other social issues.

""It is important that we don't lose sight of what's really happening here,"" he wrote. ""Binge drinking is not a defining characteristic of Scottish society, nor does it define our youth culture or the vast majority of young people. It's easy to overstate the extent and impact of these behaviours on our communities.""

However, his comments were met with fierce criticism from experts and advocacy groups who argued that Scotland's binge drinking rates are among the highest in Europe, with significant negative impacts on public health and safety.

Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS), an organization dedicated to tackling alcohol misuse, launched a campaign against McConnell's remarks, calling them ""ill-advised.""

""It is deeply concerning that someone of Jack McConnell's standing would dismiss the severity of the issue, which has caused countless harms to individuals and families across the country,"" AFS Chief Executive Jack Law said. ""His comment was ill-advised and only serves to undermine progress that has been made in reducing alcohol-related harm.""

McConnell's comments also sparked debate within the political community, with many MPs and MSPs expressing their disagreement with his stance.

Scottish Labour leader Kezia Duguid, for example, tweeted: ""I disagree with @jackmcconnell's suggestion that media coverage of binge drinking in Scotland is exaggerated. Our young people deserve better than this kind of attitude towards such a serious problem.""

Similarly, SNP MP Tommy Shepherd added: ""I think it's important that politicians take responsibility for the role they play in creating the environment that contributes to harmful drinking habits, rather than downplaying the issue like @jackmcconnell has done.""

Despite the backlash, however, some politicians defended McConnell's comments, arguing that the media coverage of binge drinking in Scotland had become too sensationalist and had lost its effectiveness in raising awareness.

Former Conservative MEP David Davies, for instance, tweeted: ""While I understand the concerns raised by those who want to keep up the moral panic surrounding binge drinking, I believe that it is counterproductive to do so.""

In response to the ongoing debate, the UK government has announced plans to launch a new national strategy aimed at addressing the root causes of alcohol-related harms and promoting more responsible consumption of alcohol.

Among the measures proposed in the strategy is a ban on promotional pricing and discounting of alcohol products, stricter regulations on advertising and marketing, and greater investment in education and treatment programs for those affected by alcohol misuse.

""We cannot afford to ignore the reality of the situation any longer,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. ""By taking action now, we can make real progress in preventing harm and building a safer, healthier society for all.""

Meanwhile, organizations working to tackle alcohol misuse in Scotland have welcomed the announcement but warned that much more needs to be done to address the issue.

""We welcome the new strategy but we know that there is still much work to be done in Scotland,"" Dr. Fiona Wood, Director of Public Health Scotland, said. ""Alcohol remains a major cause of death and illness in our country, and we must continue to work tirelessly to reduce its impact on individuals, families, and communities.""

As the debate continues and the new national strategy begins to be implemented, it remains clear",mistral7b,1

Article: Politics - Diplomas or GCSEs?

As debate continues over the proposed new qualification system for young people aged 14-19, concerns are mounting that the government may abandon its plans in favour of keeping existing GCSE and A-level exams.

Some experts argue that the four-tier diploma system would provide more options for students and better reflect their skills and abilities. However, others fear that the changes could lead to a loss of quality in education and make it harder for employers to find workers with the right skills.

One major concern is that the four-tier system could be scrapped altogether if former Labour ministers Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly get their way. Both politicians have previously expressed support for keeping GCSE and A-levels, arguing that they are well established and effective at measuring student progress.

However, supporters of the new qualification system argue that it will give students more flexibility and choice when it comes to their studies, allowing them to pursue careers in areas such as art, design, and creative industries. They also believe that the system will help reduce dropout rates among younger students who may not be suited to traditional academic paths.

Despite these arguments, there are still many questions about how the new qualification system will work in practice. For example, what kind of assessments will be used to measure student progress, and how will grades be awarded? There are also concerns about funding, with some schools warning that they may struggle to afford the resources needed to implement the new system effectively.

As the deadline for the government's decision approaches, it remains unclear whether the four-tier diplomas will go ahead, or whether the existing qualification system will remain in place. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear: the future of education in this country is undergoing significant change.",mistral7b,1

1. The former prime minister, Tony Blair, stated his opposition to raising taxes on high-income earners during an interview on Sunday night. However, on Wednesday at a press conference, he announced that other tax pledges made by the Conservative Party prior to the election would remain part of their manifesto and may only be implemented after the general vote. This decision sparked criticism from some political analysts who believed it was an attempt to backtrack on key campaign promises.
2. During the weekly session of parliamentary questions, Prime Minister Blair predicted that the government's proposed plan to reduce net migration would likely come into effect soon. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach between attracting skilled workers and maintaining social cohesion within society. His statement prompted several questions from MPs, many of whom expressed concerns over the potential impact of such measures on the economy.
3. Meanwhile, tensions continued to escalate between Britain and Iran as the latter refused to comply with international demands to disarm its nuclear program. In response, the British government imposed sanctions against various Iranian companies involved in nuclear technology development. Despite calls from some politicians to take more aggressive action against Tehran, Prime Minister Blair maintained that diplomatic efforts should continue before resorting to military intervention.
4. On the home front, the controversy surrounding the death of Ian Tomlinson at G20 protests deepened as new evidence emerged suggesting police brutality played a role in his demise. Activists and politicians alike demanded accountability from authorities, calling for an independent investigation into the incident. As riots continued across Europe, Prime Minister Blair reiterated his commitment to protecting public order while respecting individual freedoms.",mistral7b,1

Title: E-University Scraped Despite High Cost and Low Student Numbers

After being launched just two years ago, the e-University has been shut down due to its poor performance. The institution attracted only 900 students during its first year, which is much lower than expected. This came at a great financial cost as it cost the government an astonishing 50 million pounds.

Despite this, the university's chief executive, John Beaumont, received a substantial bonus payment worth 44,914 pounds for his role in leading the failed project. Many are outraged by this move as they believe that he should have faced consequences for not meeting the expectations set for him.

This event highlights the dangers of overconfidence in technology-based projects. While there may be advantages to using digital platforms for education, it is important to remember that these tools can also fail if not implemented properly. In addition, the high cost of launching and maintaining an e-University suggests that such institutions may not always be financially viable without significant investment from outside parties.

Political analysts argue that this incident could serve as a warning sign for other educational institutions looking to follow suit and establish their own online universities. They suggest that careful consideration must be given to the feasibility of such initiatives before any resources are allocated to them.

In conclusion, the failure of the e-University serves as a reminder of the importance of thorough planning and execution when implementing new technological projects. It is hoped that politicians will take note of this lesson and ensure that similar mistakes do not occur again in the future.",mistral7b,1

Title: Barbara Roche Calls for Independent Immigration Monitoring Group
Subtitle: Ex-Home Secretary Urges Establishment of Organization to Combat Anti-Immigrant Propaganda

Date: November 20, 2022
Byline: [Your Name]

Former Home Secretary Barbara Roche has called for the establishment of a monitoring group that can independently track and report on immigration statistics and counter the propaganda of anti-immigrant organizations such as Migration Watch. In her speech at a migration conference yesterday, Roche highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in the way immigration data is collected and presented to the public.

Roche criticized Migration Watch and other similar groups for their lack of independence and bias towards reducing immigration. She urged them to disclose their funding sources and methodologies to ensure their credibility and accuracy. Roche also pointed out the importance of separating fact from fiction when it comes to immigration issues, particularly in light of recent controversies over the Windrush scandal and Brexit's impact on migrants.

The proposed monitoring group would aim to provide accurate and unbiased information on immigration trends and patterns, while also promoting diversity and inclusion in society. It would work closely with governments, civil society organizations, and academics to gather data and develop policy recommendations based on empirical evidence. By doing so, the group could help combat the negative stereotypes and misinformation that have been perpetuated by certain media outlets and political parties.

Roche acknowledged that establishing such a group would require significant resources and expertise but insisted that it was essential for maintaining a fair and just approach to immigration policies. She argued that only through independent monitoring and analysis could we hope to build a more inclusive and equitable future for all members of our society.",mistral7b,1

The world leaders are coming together to discuss Africa's future at a high-stakes summit next month, it has been announced. July's G8 summit in Gleneagles in Perthshire - chaired by Prime Minister Gordon Brown - will be based on the recommendations of the Commission on Africa.

This independent body, headed by musician Sir Bob Geldof and former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, was set up two years ago to look into how the international community can better support Africa. Its report, titled ""A New Partnership for Africa,"" was published last year and called for greater investment in education, health care, and infrastructure.

Now, the heads of state from the Group of Eight nations (G8) have confirmed that they will take this advice into account when discussing their aid commitments to the continent during the summit in Scotland. This is seen as a major breakthrough for Africa, as previous summits have often failed to deliver concrete promises of increased funding.

""We welcome the publication of the Commission on Africa's report,"" said British Foreign Secretary David Miliband. ""It sets out a clear blueprint for what needs to happen if we want to see real progress on poverty reduction and development in Africa. We will use these recommendations as the basis for our discussions at the G8 summit.""

Other members of the commission include former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. They worked tirelessly over several months to produce a detailed analysis of the challenges facing Africa and proposed solutions for addressing them.

The upcoming G8 summit is expected to attract significant attention from global media, given its potential impact on shaping the future of the African continent. It remains to be seen whether the leaders present will follow through on their pledges and provide the level of funding needed to make a meaningful difference in people's lives there. However, the mere fact that such an important discussion is taking place represents a step forward towards a more equitable and prosperous world.",mistral7b,1

1. ""The Iraq War and its aftermath have been a hot topic for debate, but now it seems that even one of the most influential figures involved in the decision-making process has come forward to criticize the way it all played out."" In an interview, Lord Butler spoke openly about his role as head of the Chilcot Report, which investigated the reasons behind the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He stated that while he understood the need for action against Saddam Hussein's regime, he felt that the government had not provided enough evidence to justify the attack. Additionally, he noted that key information about the potential risks associated with military intervention had been kept from the public. The Chilcot Report is expected to be released later this year and will likely shed further light on this controversial chapter of history.



2. ""In a surprise move, former Prime Minister Tony Blair has broken his silence on the issue of Iraq and offered his own thoughts on what went wrong."" During a speech at the University of Cambridge, Mr. Blair acknowledged that mistakes were made during the lead up to the war and that there were areas where better judgment could have been exercised. However, he stopped short of apologizing for any specific actions taken during his tenure. Instead, he emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes and working together to find solutions to global problems.



3. ""Former US Vice President Dick Cheney has weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding the Iraq War. In a new memoir, 'American Exceptionalism: Renewing the American Spirit,' Cheney defended the Bush Administration's decision to go to war, arguing that they acted based on credible intelligence and were justified in doing so."" Cheney's book has already faced criticism from many quarters for its perceived lack of nuance and refusal to acknowledge the mistakes made by the administration. It remains to be seen how much impact his memoir will have on the ongoing debate over the Iraq War.



4. ""Tory leader Michael Howard has added his voice to the chorus of critics condemning the way the Iraq war was sold to the public. In an interview, he called on the British government to publish their own report into the conflict and accused them of being too cautious in presenting the facts to the public."" This comment from Howard comes after Lord Butler's critical remarks earlier this month. It appears that more and more people are questioning the justification for the Iraq War and demanding greater transparency from those responsible.



5. ""A new poll conducted by YouGov has shown that a majority of Britons believe that the Iraq War was a mistake. Of those surveyed, only 28% agreed that the country should have intervened in the conflict. The rest either thought that Britain's involvement was ill-advised or unnecessary."" These findings suggest that public opinion on the matter is shifting away from support for the war and towards a belief that it was not worth the cost. With such strong opposition, it may become increasingly difficult for the UK government to maintain its position on Iraq.



6. ""President George W. Bush has spoken out about the challenges facing the US following the end of the Iraq War. During a press conference, he admitted that the situation in Iraq was far more complex than anyone had predicted and that progress had been slower than hoped. However, he remained optimistic about the future and pledged to continue supporting the Iraqi government through its efforts to build stability in the region."" While the US has officially withdrawn its troops from Iraq, the country continues to face significant political and security challenges. It remains to be seen whether the international community will be able to provide the necessary support for the Iraqi government to overcome these obstacles.

1) The Bahamas is facing major changes as it prepares for a new era of diplomacy. The government has announced that several embassies will be closed, including those in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington DC. This move comes after the country underwent significant political upheaval earlier this year, leading to calls for a more streamlined and efficient foreign policy.
2) In addition to the closure of these three embassies, other diplomatic posts are also being restructured. For example, the British Embassy in Brasilia is set to become an honorary consulate, while the Australian Embassy in Jakarta is expected to close altogether. These changes reflect the growing trend towards outsourcing diplomatic duties to local staff, which allows countries to save money on salaries and expenses.
3) One country that has already implemented this strategy is China, which recently opened its first overseas embassy in Djibouti. This move reflects the country's growing global influence and its desire to project its power beyond its borders. Similarly, India has also been expanding its diplomatic presence in recent years, opening new embassies in Africa and Asia.
4) However, not all countries have embraced this approach wholeheartedly. Some critics argue that outsourcing diplomatic duties to locals can lead to a loss of national sovereignty and control over foreign policy. They also point out that local staff may lack the necessary experience or expertise to represent their country effectively.
5) Despite these concerns, the trend towards outsourcing diplomatic duties is likely to continue in the future. As governments seek to cut costs and focus on core priorities, they will increasingly look to local partners to handle routine tasks such as visa processing and cultural exchanges. This shift could ultimately lead to a more decentralized and diverse diplomatic landscape, with greater emphasis on regional cooperation and partnership.",mistral7b,1

""One in every thirteen students fails to attend class regularly, a worrying trend that has been on the rise for years. Despite several initiatives aimed at reducing absenteeism rates, schools across the country continue to struggle with truancy problems,"" said education expert Dr. Jane Smith.

According to official statistics, there are currently over 25 million students who fail to show up for classes each year in the United States alone. This number is particularly concerning given the fact that many of these students come from low-income families and may be struggling with various challenges that could contribute to their absences.

In recent years, schools have taken a variety of measures to try and tackle this issue. These include implementing strict attendance policies, offering counseling services to help students deal with personal or academic issues, and even partnering with community organizations to provide additional support. However, despite these efforts, truancy rates remain stubbornly high.

Many experts believe that part of the problem lies with the way society views absence from work or school. In some cases, people view it as simply an inconvenience rather than a serious concern, which can lead to complacency when it comes to addressing the issue head-on. Others argue that our current approach to education is too focused on standardized testing and not enough on providing meaningful experiences for students, which can cause them to lose interest and stop attending classes altogether.

Despite these challenges, there are also signs of progress. Over the past two decades, schools across the country have worked together to bring nearly 40,000 students back into the classroom through various initiatives aimed at tackling chronic absenteeism. While this is just a small fraction of the overall population, it represents an important step forward in the fight against truancy.",mistral7b,1

1) The Home Secretary announced that a comprehensive review of the UK's murder laws is to begin following the recommendations made by the Law Commission earlier this year. In their report, the commission criticized the existing legislation for being unclear and inconsistent, stating that it created a ""mess"" when it came to punishing violent offenders. As part of the review, the government will consider changes to the legal framework surrounding partial defenses such as provocation. Additionally, there may be a reevaluation of mandatory sentencing guidelines. This move has been welcomed by many in the criminal justice system who have long called for greater clarity and consistency in the country's homicide laws.
2) The review into the UK's murder laws is set to take place after the Law Commission released its damning report on the subject earlier this month. According to the report, the current laws governing the taking of life are confusing and contradictory, making them difficult for courts to interpret correctly. This has led to concerns that criminals are not receiving appropriate punishment for their crimes. With the review expected to focus on issues like provocation and mandatory sentencing, there is hope that the government will finally bring much-needed clarity to the legal system.
3) The announcement of the review comes after years of calls from campaigners for reform of the UK's murder laws. Many argue that the current legislation fails to provide adequate protections for victims and families, while also giving too little guidance to judges regarding what constitutes an acceptable sentence. By launching this review, the government appears committed to addressing these issues head-on. It remains to be seen how far the proposed changes will go, but there is optimism among those involved that progress will soon be made.
4) In confirming the review of UK's murder laws, the Home Secretary acknowledged that there were significant problems with the current legislation. The review is expected to examine all aspects of the law, including the definition of murder itself, the use of firearms in murders and the treatment of different types of killings. The Home Secretary added that they would also look at partial defenses such as self-defense or diminished responsibility. The outcome of this review could result in major changes to the law that will impact the criminal justice system.",mistral7b,1

Politics News - Government Rules Out Amending Self Defence Law

In a move that will disappoint homeowners and security advocates alike, the government has ruled out amending the present law on self-defense to allow for greater protection against intruders. This decision comes despite calls from opposition parties and even the Prime Minister himself to reform the current laws.

Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, stating, ""It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."" His comments come after several high-profile break-ins where homeowners have been left feeling vulnerable due to the existing laws. The ruling party had previously indicated that they were open to making changes to the law, but recent events appear to have caused them to change their minds.

The decision to keep the status quo has sparked criticism from opponents of the government. They argue that the current legal system does little to deter potential thieves and leaves homeowners feeling exposed. Some have even gone so far as to say that the government is putting its own interests before the safety of ordinary people.

However, supporters of the government argue that the law is necessary to prevent overreach by law enforcement agencies. They believe that allowing greater latitude in the use of force would lead to more innocent people being wrongly accused or arrested.

The debate on self-defense legislation has raged on for years, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, it appears that the ruling party has decided to side with the status quo at least for now. It remains to be seen whether this decision will ultimately be popular with voters or if further pressure from opposition parties will result in future reforms.",mistral7b,1

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has met with his European Union counterparts in London for talks on Turkey's membership bid, which was put forward earlier this year. The Downing Street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later in the week. The UK government has been under increasing pressure from Turkish leaders and supporters to support their country's inclusion in the EU. Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU. He believes that Turkey would greatly benefit economically from joining the EU and that it could serve as a valuable ally in the fight against terrorism. However, there are concerns among some member states about Turkey's human rights record and its treatment of minority groups. The UK will be working closely with other EU countries to address these issues before making any final decisions on whether to admit Turkey into the bloc.",mistral7b,1

Political analysts have been quick to react to Nick Clegg's comments in his New Year message, as he criticized both Labour and the Conservative parties for their reliance on fear tactics in order to win votes. The Liberal Democrat leader stated that his party stood out as the only option for voters who were looking for hope and a positive future.

Clegg's remarks came at a time when tensions between the three major UK political parties are particularly high. Many observers feel that the current election cycle is marked by negative campaigning and a focus on issues such as crime, immigration, and national security.

However, not everyone agrees with Clegg's assessment of the situation. Some argue that while it may be true that fear has played a role in certain campaigns, all politicians use a variety of strategies to try and appeal to voters. They also point out that many people vote based on specific policy positions rather than just general feelings of optimism or pessimism.

Despite these disagreements, however, there is no doubt that Clegg's statement will generate significant interest among political watchers. In particular, it will likely raise questions about how successful the Liberal Democrats might be if they choose to run on a platform of hope and positivity instead of focusing solely on negative issues.

Some observers have already expressed skepticism about this approach, arguing that voters tend to respond more strongly to threats and warnings than they do to messages of optimism. Others believe that this could actually prove to be a winning strategy, especially if the Liberal Democrats can effectively frame themselves as the party that offers the best chance of creating a better future for all citizens.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether Clegg's vision for British politics will resonate with voters. However, one thing is clear: the coming year promises to be an exciting and unpredictable period for UK politics, with plenty of twists and turns along the way.",mistral7b,1

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has hit out at human rights lawyers for their criticism of the detention of two men suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. Mr Johnson claimed that the right to life was ""the most important liberty"" and insisted that the government had a responsibility to protect people from extremists who threatened their security. He also accused law lords of making an error by implying that the men were being held without any justification or due process, which he described as ""completely unacceptable"".

Mr Johnson's comments come after a legal challenge to the detention of the two suspects, whose names are not known, under section 28 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The High Court ruled on Monday that they could be kept in custody for up to 14 days while police investigations continue. However, the judges also raised concerns over whether their detention was necessary given there was no concrete evidence linking them to any specific plot or attack.

In response to the ruling, Mr Johnson issued a statement saying: ""I am deeply disappointed with this decision, which I believe is simply wrong. We have a clear moral obligation to ensure that our citizens are protected from those who seek to harm them through acts of violence, including terrorist attacks. This means taking all necessary steps to prevent such attacks, even if it involves holding individuals for a short period of time while investigations take place.""

He went on to say that the government would appeal the decision and urged lawmakers to support its efforts to combat terrorism. ""As a country, we cannot allow ourselves to be crippled by fear or intimidation,"" he added. ""We must stand firm against terror and work together to build a safer future for ourselves and generations to come.""

Labour MP Tom Watson, however, criticised Mr Johnson's remarks and warned that his views risked undermining fundamental principles of civil liberties. ""It is deeply concerning to hear someone like Boris Johnson suggest that the right to life is more important than other freedoms like freedom of speech and association,"" he said. ""This kind of rhetoric plays into the hands of extremists who want to divide us and erode our values as a society.""

Watson also argued that the government should respect the judgement of independent courts and avoid using legislation to suppress dissent. ""We should not use anti-terror laws to silence legitimate voices of opposition and critics of the government,"" he said. ""Instead, we should engage with these groups and listen to their concerns so that we can better protect everyone from real threats, whether they come from domestic or international sources.""

Meanwhile, Amnesty International expressed concern that the UK was becoming increasingly repressive when it came to issues of national security. ""There is a worrying trend of using broad counter-terrorism measures to stifle freedom of expression and assembly,"" the organisation's director Kate Allen said. ""This includes banning protests, arresting peaceful activists, and criminalising legitimate forms of political dissent. These actions are damaging to democracy and undermine trust between governments and the public they serve.""

Allen called on the government to strike a balance between protecting people from terrorism and preserving basic human rights. ""The UK must recognise that the fight against terrorism does not justify trampling on the very rights and freedoms that make us strong,"" she said. ""We need a robust but balanced approach that ensures both safety and liberty for all members of our society.""

Overall, the controversy surrounding the detention of the two suspects highlights the complex relationship between national security interests and individual freedoms. While the government may argue that extreme measures are justified in order to keep people safe, there are many who question the extent to which such actions infringe upon basic civil liberties and undermine democratic institutions. As such, it will likely remain a contentious issue well into the future.",mistral7b,1

Political turmoil is not something that many people relish. In times of crisis or uncertainty, it can be hard to know what's happening next. One person who has spent years navigating these complex waters is former home secretary David Blunkett. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify as he took up one of the most important roles in British government. As head of the Home Office, he was responsible for everything from civil emergencies to terrorism and expenditure. It was a position that required immense skill and political acumen.

When Mr Blunkett first entered parliament, he quickly made a name for himself as an ambitious young politician. He rose through the ranks at breakneck speed, eventually becoming a member of Tony Blair's inner circle. However, this rapid rise came at a cost. Many politicians have spoken out about the toll that such intense scrutiny can take on someone's personal life and mental health. For Mr Blunkett, this would become all too clear.

In 2005, he admitted to having an affair with a married woman named Kim McNally. This revelation led to widespread speculation about whether he should continue in his role as home secretary. The fallout from the scandal left him deeply shaken and struggling to cope with the pressure. But he refused to resign, instead pledging to remain committed to his duties as a minister.

Despite facing criticism and calls for his resignation, Mr Blunkett remained steadfast in his commitment to his office. His tenure as home secretary saw him navigate numerous high-profile crises, including the London bombings of July 2005 and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. Through it all, he worked tirelessly to ensure that Britain was safe and secure.

But even as he continued in his role, the weight of his past mistakes weighed heavily on him. After stepping down as home secretary in 2009, Mr Blunkett retreated into private life, vowing never again to seek public office. Despite this, however, his legacy continues to resonate with those who served under him during his time as home secretary.

Many of his successors have spoken out about how much they learned from working alongside Mr Blunkett. They praised his ability to think strategically and tactically, his unwavering determination, and his willingness to listen to others. These qualities made him an effective leader and helped to shape British politics for years to come.

As for Mr Blunkett himself, he has largely kept a low profile since leaving office. There are rumors that he may return to politics in the future, but for now, he seems content to let his achievements stand as testament to his time as home secretary. Whatever comes next for this man who has seen so much change in his career, there will undoubtedly be more challenges ahead. But if anyone is capable of meeting them head-on, it's David Blunkett.",mistral7b,1

The Cabinet Office has announced a major review of the UK's pension system, which could see significant changes to the way employees are able to retire. The move comes after a long campaign by unions representing millions of workers, who have been pushing for reforms that would give them greater flexibility and control over their financial futures.

One of the main concerns raised by the unions is the proposed increase in the mandatory retirement age for public sector workers. Under current laws, public servants are required to leave their jobs at the age of 60, but this could soon change under new plans being considered by the government. Unions argue that such a change would be unfair to many employees, particularly those who may not be physically or mentally able to continue working beyond the current age limit.

In response to the news, several unions representing more than 4.5 million workers have threatened to take joint action if the plans go ahead. This includes organizing strikes, protests, and other forms of industrial action, which could cause disruptions across the country. Unison, one of the largest unions involved, said it was prepared to do whatever it takes to protect its members' rights and interests.

""This is an outrageous attempt to impose on our members a pension system that will force them to work longer and earn less,"" said Unison general secretary Len McCluskey. ""We will fight tooth and nail against these proposals and we won't stop until they are defeated.""

Other unions have also expressed their opposition to the proposed changes. For example, GMB, another large trade union, said it had received numerous reports from members who were concerned about the potential impact of the changes on their pensions and job security.

""These plans could lead to thousands of workers losing their jobs and facing financial hardship,"" said GMB national secretary Jason Donovan. ""We cannot let that happen. We must stand together and demand better for our members.""

Despite the strong opposition from unions, the government remains committed to reforming the pension system. In recent years, there have been calls to raise the state pension age and introduce a new type of retirement savings account called individual accounts (ISAs). Supporters of ISAs argue that they would give individuals more control over their own retirement savings, while critics warn that they could lead to lower pensions and higher levels of poverty among older people.

However, the Cabinet Office has yet to reveal any details about the specific measures it intends to implement as part of its review. It is likely that further announcements will be made in due course, which could spark even more controversy and debate.

In summary, the announcement of a major review of the UK's pension system has led to threats of industrial action",mistral7b,1

An article published in The Guardian has highlighted the importance of older voters in deciding the outcome of the upcoming general election. According to a survey conducted by a charity, 69% of people aged 55 and above stated that they always voted in a general election, while only 17% of those aged 18 to 24 shared the same sentiment. This indicates that young people are less likely to participate actively in the voting process.
Charity boss Gordon Lishman emphasized the significance of older voters in determining the election's results. He suggested that a ""decisive blow"" would be dealt if this demographic turned out in large numbers to cast their votes. It appears that the views of older voters hold more weight than those of younger generations. As such, politicians should focus on winning the support of older voters to secure victory in the polls.
In another development, the Labour party has announced plans to target older voters with its campaign messaging. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth revealed that the party will prioritize issues affecting older people, including social care reform and NHS funding cuts. By appealing directly to this group, Labour hopes to gain an advantage over other parties vying for support from older voters.
The Conservatives have also been quick to acknowledge the critical role played by older voters in determining the election's outcome. Party leader Boris Johnson pledged to deliver Brexit by October 31st, which he believes will appeal to older voters who want clarity regarding the UK's departure from the EU. However, concerns have been raised about how his promises will impact the country's economic stability and the wellbeing of future generations.
Overall, it is clear that older voters play a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. Politicians must take note of this fact and tailor their campaigns accordingly to win their support. Failure to do so may result in missed opportunities to shape policy decisions that benefit everyone in society.",mistral7b,1

The UK government has been under scrutiny over the royal family's finances, particularly regarding Prince Charles' spending on his wife Camilla Parker Bowles. A report by the Telegraph revealed that aides from the Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall may have to answer questions before the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) regarding the matter. The committee is responsible for ensuring transparency in public expenditure and has the power to summon witnesses if necessary.

According to sources close to the PAC, the two duchies are expected to provide evidence about how they manage their funds, including any payments made to the duke and duchess of Cornwall. This includes gifts given to the couple, as well as expenses related to their official duties. The committee also wants to hear more about the role of these duchies in funding the royal household as a whole.

If called upon, the aides would likely face intense questioning from MPs on the committee, who have already expressed concerns over the royal family's financial dealings. Some have accused them of hiding information and not being transparent enough about their spending, which could result in significant costs to taxpayers. However, others argue that it is important to respect the privacy of the royal family and allow them to carry out their responsibilities without constant scrutiny.",mistral7b,1

Article 1: The rise of English and Welsh applications for Scottish universities has been attributed to a new policy on tuition fees, which was implemented last year. However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. In an interview, he stated that the increase in foreign applications is due to Scotland's strong academic reputation, rather than its lower cost compared to other UK institutions.

""Scotland remains one of the best places in the world to study,"" Wallace said. ""The fact that more people are choosing to come here is a testament to our high-quality education system."" He also emphasized that there is still no cap on tuition fees in Scotland, and that the government will continue to invest heavily in higher education.

Despite the concerns raised over the potential impact of increased competition on Scottish universities, Wallace remained optimistic. He believes that Scotland can continue to attract international students through its excellent research facilities and unique cultural experiences. Additionally, the country's relatively small population means that students can benefit from close-knit communities and personalized attention from professors.

In response to the rise in applications, many Scottish universities have expanded their marketing efforts in England and Wales. This includes offering scholarships and financial aid packages to entice prospective students to choose a Scottish institution. Despite these initiatives, however, it remains uncertain whether the surge in applications will lead to a significant influx of non-Scottish students into Scottish universities.

Overall, while there may be some short-term challenges associated with increasing competition in the higher education sector, the long-term benefits of attracting diverse student populations to Scottish universities cannot be understated. As Wallace puts it, ""We must embrace diversity as a strength and continue to provide opportunities for students from all backgrounds to succeed.""

Article 2: With the implementation of new policies regarding tuition fees in England and Wales, it seems that Scottish universities are gaining popularity among students from those regions. According to recent statistics, applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. While this may be concerning for some who fear that Scottish universities could become oversaturated with non-native students, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace believes that there is nothing to worry about.

In an official statement, Wallace noted that the increase in applicants from England and Wales is likely due to Scotland's reputation as a top destination for higher education. ""Scotland has always had a strong tradition of excellence in academia, and this legacy continues today,"" Wallace said. He added that Scottish universities offer a wide range of programs and courses at affordable prices, making them attractive options for students seeking a quality education without breaking the bank.

Furthermore, Wallace pointed out that Scottish universities are committed to providing equal opportunities for all students, regardless of where they come from or what they study. By continuing to prioritize diversity and inclusion, Scottish institutions can maintain their competitive edge in the global marketplace of higher education.

As Scottish universities continue to attract more applications from overseas, it is clear that the country's higher education sector is thriving. Whether you are a current student, alumnus, or simply someone interested in pursuing further education, now is a great time to consider studying in Scotland. With its rich history, stunning landscapes, and vibrant culture, there is truly something for everyone who chooses to call Scotland home.",mistral7b,1

1) The departure of former Home Secretary David Blunkett has sparked renewed calls for an independent review of immigration policies, as Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy seized on the opportunity to challenge the government's approach to the issue. In his first major speech since becoming party leader, Mr Kennedy called on the government to reconsider its stance on immigration and to work towards a more balanced system that takes into account both the economic needs of businesses and the social welfare concerns of communities across the country. He also criticised the way in which the current system is managed by the Home Office and questioned why it continues to be so centralized. While the Conservatives have yet to respond to Mr Kennedy's comments, they are likely to face pressure from their own backbenchers who share his concerns about the need for greater transparency and accountability in the immigration process.
2) As the debate over immigration policy intensifies, Labour MP Tom Watson has become one of the most vocal critics of the government's approach. In a letter published today, Mr Watson accused the Home Office of failing to address the root causes of illegal migration and instead focusing too much on punitive measures such as detention centres and deportations. He also highlighted the inconsistencies in the government's policies, arguing that while the Prime Minister has spoken out against human trafficking, his administration continues to allow companies that use exploitative practices to operate without fear of sanction. Mr Watson's criticism comes just days after the Home Office announced plans to introduce new regulations aimed at cracking down on illegal migration, including increasing police powers and creating new offences related to people smuggling. It remains to be seen how effective these measures will be, but they are sure to spark further controversy given the ongoing tensions between the government and the opposition parties on this contentious issue.
3) Amidst growing concern over immigration policy, there is also mounting frustration within the Conservative Party about the way in which it is being handled by the government. Several senior Tory figures have privately expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has approached the issue, particularly her decision to scrap controversial plans for ID cards and national databases. They argue that this move represents a betrayal of the party's commitment to tackling crime and terrorism and could undermine public confidence in law enforcement agencies. However, Ms Smith has defended her actions, arguing that the original proposals were flawed and would not have been effective in achieving their intended goals. She also insists that the government is taking a comprehensive approach to immigration policy that includes measures to improve integration and promote social mobility for those living here legally. Nevertheless, the row is unlikely to end anytime soon, as the Conservatives continue to press home their criticisms of the government's handling of this sensitive issue.",mistral7b,1

Title: Parental Custody and Access Rights: The Legal System's Role

In recent years, issues surrounding parental custodial arrangements have become increasingly complex. As such, it is essential for policymakers to carefully consider how best to address these challenges while ensuring that children's rights are protected. One key aspect of this issue concerns the role of courts in determining and upholding custody orders.

According to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee, there are significant concerns regarding potential abuses by individuals seeking parental custody. In particular, there is a risk that those who do gain custody may use the legal system as an instrument of manipulation or control over other family members, including ex-partners. This can lead to lengthy, drawn-out court battles that result in further delay and uncertainty for all parties involved.

To prevent these problems from occurring in the first place, the committee has recommended several measures aimed at strengthening the enforcement of custody orders. Firstly, it suggests that courts should only grant custody to those who truly meet the needs of the child, rather than simply being granted it outright without proper consideration. Additionally, the committee recommends that judges should take steps to ensure that any delays caused by the legal process do not harm the interests of the child. For example, they suggest that judges may wish to impose time limits on cases involving custody disputes in order to speed things along.

Furthermore, MPs argue that there are many ways in which the legal system can work more efficiently to resolve parental disputes. These include increasing funding for mediation services, providing greater support for families going through difficult times, and improving communication between different stakeholders in the legal process. By taking these steps, we can help reduce the need for costly, time-consuming legal battles and ensure that children receive the care and attention they deserve.

Ultimately, however, it is important to remember that the courts should always serve as a last resort when it comes to resolving parental disputes. Instead of relying solely on litigation to settle these matters, policymakers must explore alternative options that prioritize the wellbeing of both children and their families. Whether that involves increased investment in counseling services, better coordination among various government agencies, or new approaches to dispute resolution, we must remain committed to finding creative solutions that put our children first.",mistral7b,1

1. Amitai Etzioni: US focus on 'axis of evil' misguided

8. Failure of state governance poses greatest risk to global security, says political analyst
9. Amitai Etzioni urges caution in pursuing military action against failing states
10. Expert calls for nuanced approach in dealing with countries on brink of collapse

The United States has been under pressure to shift its focus away from the so-called ""Axis of Evil,"" which includes North Korea, Iran and Iraq. According to political expert Amitai Etzioni, this emphasis is misplaced as it fails to address the root cause of many conflicts, namely weak and corrupt governments that are unable to control their own borders.

Instead, he argues, the world needs to pay closer attention to ""failing states"" such as Russia and Pakistan, both of whom possess nuclear weapons but lack the ability to secure them effectively. This could potentially lead to a catastrophic event if these materials were to fall into the wrong hands.

Etzioni also believes that the international community must do more to help stabilize struggling democracies by providing financial assistance, technical expertise and training to improve governance and infrastructure. He stresses that this would not only benefit the people living in these countries but also prevent future crises and reduce the chances of armed conflict breaking out.

Despite his warnings, there have been those who argue that the United States needs to continue targeting rogue states due to their perceived links to terrorism. However, Etzioni counters that terror groups can operate anywhere, making it crucial to address underlying issues such as poverty, inequality and political instability.

In conclusion, Amitai Etzioni highlights the importance of recognizing the role played by weak and corrupt governments in destabilizing regions around the globe. While the US has taken steps to combat terrorism, it needs to consider how best to tackle the root causes of violence, particularly in failing states where nuclear weapons are at risk of falling into the wrong hands. By doing so, the international community may be able to promote peace and stability while ensuring that no country poses an imminent threat to global security.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:

In recent years, many people have come forward claiming that they were betrayed by the British authorities. One such individual is Viktor Makarov, a former Soviet spy who was promised defector status and a decent pension by the government. However, despite being awarded a £65,000 settlement four years ago, Makarov still feels as though he has not received what he was owed.

""I came to this country hoping for a better life,"" said Makarov, now aged 50. ""But I can't help feeling betrayed. Despite all my hard work and sacrifice, I am still living below the poverty line and struggling to make ends meet.""

Makarov claims that he was recruited into KGB intelligence during the Cold War era and spent decades working undercover in the UK before defecting to Britain. He had hoped that his services would be recognized and rewarded with defector status, which would grant him access to financial support and other benefits.

However, after receiving the settlement money from the government, Makarov found himself no closer to achieving his goals than before. ""The settlement money did help me get by, but it wasn't enough to give me the kind of life I had envisioned when I arrived here,"" he explained.

Despite his struggles, Makarov remains determined to fight for the recognition he deserves. ""I know there are others out there who are going through similar experiences, and we need to stand together to demand justice,"" he said.

Article 2:

As the political landscape continues to shift in Britain, many individuals feel as though they have been left behind. For Viktor Makarov, this sentiment rings especially true. Despite having worked tirelessly for the British government as a spy, he still finds himself without the recognition and support that he needs to thrive.

According to Makarov, he was promised defender status and a decent pension by the British authorities when he first defected to Britain. However, despite receiving a substantial settlement four years ago, he still has not received either one. ""It's frustrating to think that the government promised me these things, but then failed to deliver on their end of the bargain,"" he said.

Makarov also expressed frustration at the lack of transparency and communication from the government regarding his case. ""For too long, I have felt like just another number in a file somewhere,"" he said. ""I deserve answers and accountability, and I won't stop fighting until I get them.""

With the future uncertain for both Makarov and other spies who have defected to Britain, many are calling on the government to take action. They want to see those who have put their lives on the line for our country given the support and recognition they so rightfully deserve.",mistral7b,1

The Liberal Democrats have proposed a plan to raise the stamp duty land tax threshold for first-time buyers to £150,000, which would exempt more than 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax. This move is aimed at addressing the affordability crisis and increasing accessibility for first-time buyers who are struggling to enter the housing market. Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said that raising the threshold was crucial to ensuring that people could afford to purchase their first homes without facing excessive financial strain.

According to Cable, this proposal would also help alleviate the pressure on first-time buyers by allowing them to save money towards other costs associated with buying a property, such as deposits or legal fees. Additionally, he believes it will encourage more people to invest in property and support the growth of the construction industry. However, critics argue that this measure may not be sufficient to address the underlying issues causing the affordability crisis, such as rising house prices and stagnant wages. They suggest that more comprehensive policies are needed to tackle these root causes and create long-term stability in the housing market.",mistral7b,1

Ms Kelly, who has been the education secretary since July 18th this year, spoke out on the issue of bullying and disruption in schools today during a visit to St Mary's Primary School in London. She said that while significant strides had been made in addressing the most severe cases of bullying, there were still concerns about less severe issues affecting many students. Ms Kelly added that she was aware of the pressure faced by parents, teachers and school leaders when dealing with these types of incidents.

During her address, Ms Kelly also confirmed that she had received ""spiritual support"" from the Catholic movement Opus Dei. This revelation sparked controversy among some commentators, with fears that the government may be seeking to align itself too closely with any particular religious group. However, Ms Kelly insisted that she did not see any conflict between her role as an education minister and her personal faith.

""As someone who is deeply committed to my faith, I don't think it's possible for me to separate my spiritual beliefs from my public duties,"" she said. ""I believe that we all have something valuable to contribute to society, whether through our work or our faith, and I am grateful for any support or guidance that helps me fulfil my role more effectively.""

Ms Kelly went on to say that she was particularly concerned about bullying and its impact on young people. She acknowledged that it could take different forms, ranging from physical attacks and verbal abuse to cyberbullying and social media harassment. She called on schools to do more to tackle these issues head-on, saying: ""It's crucial that every child feels safe and respected at school. We need schools that are supportive environments where everyone can learn and grow without fear.""

Ms Kelly also announced plans to introduce new measures aimed at improving mental health provision in schools. She said that research showed that young people who experienced bullying were more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. By providing additional resources and training for school staff, she hoped to ensure that students who were struggling with their mental health got the help they needed.

The announcement of these initiatives drew praise from many, with teachers and educational professionals hailing them as positive steps towards creating safer and happier classrooms. However, others expressed concern about the potential cost implications of such measures, given the already stretched budget for education. Ms Kelly acknowledged the financial pressures facing schools, and promised that the government would continue to prioritise funding for education and mental health services.

In conclusion, Ms Kelly's comments highlighted the ongoing challenge of tackling bullying and other behavioural issues in schools. While progress has been made in recent years, there remains much work to be done to create truly inclusive and welcoming learning environments for all students. With the continued support of schools, families, and the wider community, Ms Kelly is confident that together, we can make a real difference in the lives of young people across the country.",mistral7b,1

Title: Government to trial new approach to inclusive citizenship through piloting program

Date: September 1, 2023

Source: ABC News

The Australian government is set to launch a pilot program aimed at promoting inclusivity and encouraging participation among ethnic minorities in political decision-making processes. The initiative will see the introduction of citizenship ceremonies held throughout the year in various locations across the country.

According to Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, the program aims to create greater understanding and appreciation of diversity within the community, while also empowering individuals from multicultural backgrounds to engage more actively in the democratic process. He stated that the idea was developed after extensive consultation with local communities and stakeholders, who expressed concerns that existing citizenship programs were not doing enough to foster a sense of belonging and ownership among minority groups.

Under the proposed plan, eligible candidates would participate in a series of workshops designed to educate them on the history and values of Australian democracy, as well as providing opportunities for feedback and discussion with other participants. Those who successfully complete the program would then attend a formal citizenship ceremony where they would take the oath of allegiance and receive their official certificate.

In addition to promoting inclusion and civic engagement, the pilot program also aims to address concerns surrounding the lengthy waiting times for citizenship applications. According to immigration experts, many applicants face delays due to administrative backlogs and processing times, leading to frustration and feelings of disconnection from society. By offering a faster pathway to citizenship for those participating in the program, the government hopes to alleviate this issue and encourage greater integration into Australian culture.

While the pilot scheme is still in its early stages, it has already generated significant interest among members of the community. Local councils and community organizations have expressed support for the program, citing its potential to bring people together and promote mutual respect and understanding.

One such organization, the Multicultural Council of Victoria, welcomed the announcement of the pilot scheme and praised the government's efforts to improve the lives of migrants and refugees. ""This is a fantastic opportunity to provide newcomers with the knowledge and skills they need to fully contribute to our society,"" said council president Mary Sauer.

As the program gets underway, it remains to be seen how effective it will be in achieving its goals. However, if successful, it could pave the way for further reforms aimed",mistral7b,1

China has been under fire for its treatment of minority groups and human rights abuses, including the 15-year-old ban imposed following its crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square. The ban prohibits all forms of public gatherings and protests, making it difficult to organize peaceful demonstrations against Beijing's policies. In recent years, there have been reports of increased surveillance and censorship of dissenting voices, as well as allegations of torture and other human rights violations. Despite these issues, many countries continue to do business with China, raising questions about their commitment to promoting democracy and protecting individual freedoms.

In an interview with the Guardian, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his concern that China's actions could lead to a new cold war between East and West. He also warned that Beijing's authoritarian regime is not sustainable in the long run, saying that ""it cannot go on forever."" However, he added that he believes the international community can work together to find solutions to the challenges facing both sides. ""We need to keep talking to each other, we need to engage with them,"" he said.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated Washington's stance on China during a press briefing earlier this week. He condemned Beijing's treatment of Uighurs, calling it ""genocide"" and urged other countries to take action to hold China accountable. ""There are no excuses for what Beijing is doing,"" Blinken said. His comments came just days after the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution condemning China for its actions in Xinjiang.

Despite mounting pressure from the international community, China remains steadfast in its pursuit of economic growth and political control. In a speech at the National People's Congress last month, President Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of maintaining stability and unity in the face of growing threats, both domestically and abroad. He also pledged to continue investing in infrastructure projects and modernizing the military, further fueling fears of an arms race with the US.

As tensions rise, many experts predict that the situation will only become more volatile in the coming months and years. Some worry that a confrontation between China and the US could lead to a global conflict, while others fear that internal strife within China could destabilize the region. Whatever happens, one thing is clear: the world is watching China closely, and its actions will have far-reaching consequences for decades to come.",mistral7b,1

The ongoing election saga took another dramatic turn as Royal Mail announced that it was launching an investigation into why thousands of voters in County Durham were left without their voting packs. The incident comes after reports emerged last week that hundreds of households in the region had been affected by a delay in the delivery of postal ballots. As a result, approximately 300 homes in Darlington have yet to receive their voting papers.

This latest development has sparked fears among politicians that the delay could lead to voter disenfranchisement, particularly for those who may have already submitted their ballot papers before being informed of the problem. With just days remaining until polling day on May 7th, officials at Darlington Council are now racing against time to ensure that all eligible voters have access to their ballots.

In response to concerns raised by residents, Royal Mail has pledged to work closely with council officials to investigate the root cause of the issue and find a solution as quickly as possible. However, given the complexity of the matter and the sheer number of people involved, there are no guarantees that a satisfactory resolution will be found ahead of time.

Meanwhile, political parties across the board have called on the government to take action to prevent similar problems from occurring in future elections. Many have expressed frustration with the current electoral system, arguing that it is too prone to errors and delays, putting at risk the very principles upon which democracy rests.

As tensions rise over the issue, one thing is certain: the countdown to polling day continues apace, with just days left for any final solutions to be put in place.

Title: The Muslim Vote Could Decide Up To 50 Constituencies, Say Organizers Of Event

Date: March 29th, 2023

By [Author Name]:

The Muslim community has been encouraged to exercise their right to vote in upcoming general elections, according to organizers of an event hosted by the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB). The event, which takes place on Saturday at a venue in London, aims to educate and motivate Muslim voters to turn out in large numbers for this year's election.

According to MAB, there are currently over three million Muslims living in the UK, making up around 8% of the country's population. This demographic group is expected to have a significant impact on the outcome of the upcoming general election, potentially deciding the fate of up to 50 seats.

Last year, the organization called on Muslims to abstain from voting in the European elections as they were unhappy with the political parties on offer. However, ahead of the upcoming general election, MAB has changed its stance and is now encouraging people to get involved in the democratic process.

""We urge all Muslim voters to engage in this crucial election,"" said Dr Mohammed Shafiq, the Secretary-General of MAB. ""It is our responsibility as British citizens to make sure that we use our voices effectively to shape the future of our communities and country.""

During the event, speakers will discuss issues affecting the Muslim community, including immigration policy, education, healthcare, and social justice. They will also share insights into how to register to vote and what to expect when casting their ballots.

In addition to the educational aspect, the event is also designed to be fun and engaging, featuring live music and performances by popular artists from the local area.

As well as providing information and entertainment, the MAB hopes to encourage more young people to take part in the electoral process. According to research carried out by the organization, only 47% of eligible young Muslim men aged between 18 and 24 voted in the last general election, compared to just under 60% among other ethnic groups.

""There is no excuse for not voting,"" added Dr Shafiq. ""Young people should realize the importance of having their voices heard and getting involved in shaping the future of this great nation.""

Despite the potential impact of the Muslim vote, many politicians have yet to fully appreciate or recognize the significance of this demographic group. In recent years, there has been growing concern about anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK, particularly following high-profile attacks such as those carried out in Manchester and London.

However, despite these challenges, MAB remains optimistic about the ability of Muslim voters to play a vital role in shaping the future of politics in the UK. With millions of votes up for grabs, the organization is determined to ensure that this important demographic group is represented fairly and accurately in the upcoming general election.",mistral7b,1

Politicians from all parties are backing the move, which comes as concerns grow over the impact of late-night shopping on health and wellbeing. Retail workers often have to work long hours, missing out on family time during festive periods. Supporters say it's important to give them a chance to rest and spend time with loved ones, without worrying about work.

The proposed legislation has already received strong support from Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who called on other politicians to get behind the bill. ""We must prioritise our people's health and wellbeing,"" she said. ""It's simply not right for retail workers to miss out on spending time with their families just because they need to go to work. We owe it to them to do something about this.""

Retail bosses, however, are less than enthusiastic about the idea, warning that closing stores on major holidays could lead to job losses and economic instability. They also argue that customers want to shop whenever it suits them, rather than being tied to specific dates. But supporters of the bill say it wouldn't affect overall consumer demand, and that the benefits to workers far outweigh any potential negative effects.

Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister, was one of the most vocal advocates for Turkish membership in the European Union (EU). Despite widespread opposition to the move, he stood firm and pushed for Turkey's admission into the EU. In an interview after leaving a Brussels summit on Tuesday, Blair reiterated his support for Turkish membership, saying that it did not matter if Turkey was a Muslim country. He argued that Turkey met all the necessary criteria for EU membership, including having a functioning democracy and adopting Western values and standards.

Blair faced criticism from many quarters for his stance on Turkish membership. Some politicians questioned whether Turkey was truly ready for EU membership, while others worried that allowing a predominantly Muslim country into the bloc could undermine its core principles of freedom and equality. However, Blair remained steadfast and maintained that Turkey had made significant progress in recent years and deserved a place in the EU. He also pointed out that Turkey would bring significant economic benefits to the EU and strengthen ties between Europe and Asia.

In conclusion, Tony Blair's stance on Turkish membership remains controversial even today. While there are valid concerns about Turkey's readiness for EU membership, Blair's argument that it is unfair to discriminate against a Muslim country based solely on their religion is worth considering. As Europe faces increasing pressure from other countries seeking to join the union, Blair's message may become increasingly relevant in shaping how we approach future EU expansion decisions.",mistral7b,1

Title: UK Denies British Passport to Former Zambian President's Aide

Date: March 21, 2023

In a surprising move, the UK government has denied British citizenship to former Zambian president Michael Sata's aide, Martin Mubanga. The decision came after a letter sent to Mubanga stated that evidence gathered against him by the US had convinced the Home Office not to issue him a British passport.

Mubanga, who worked closely with Sata during his presidency and is currently serving a life sentence in prison on corruption charges in Zambia, had been applying for British citizenship since 2018. However, the Home Office's refusal to grant him citizenship suggests that there are concerns about what he might do if he leaves Zambia.

The letter to Mubanga said that his application had been refused based on information gathered by intelligence agencies in both the UK and US. It also cited evidence of alleged ties between Mubanga and extremist groups operating outside Zambia, as well as potential threats to the safety of UK nationals abroad.

According to sources close to the matter, the Home Office believes that Mubanga is at risk of engaging in terrorist activity if he were ever granted British citizenship. This could include carrying out attacks against UK or allied targets, either directly or through proxies.

The decision to deny Mubanga British citizenship is significant because it marks the first time the UK government has taken such steps against a high-ranking political figure. The move may also raise questions about the UK's commitment to upholding its own values of freedom and democracy, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Zambia.

Zambia has experienced widespread instability over the past few years, with protests erupting across the country calling for President Edgar Lungu's resignation. There have also been allegations of human rights abuses and corruption within the ruling party, which have contributed to growing unrest among the population.

As tensions continue to simmer in Zambia, many observers fear that the situation could escalate into full-blown conflict. The denial of citizenship to Mubanga, who has maintained close ties with the ruling party despite facing corruption charges, suggests that the UK government is taking these fears seriously and is willing to take action to protect its interests.",mistral7b,1

1. The men accused of storming the House of Commons have been released on bail. They were arrested in September during a heated debate over a proposed hunting ban. Among those charged were Otis Ferry, the son of renowned musician Bryan Ferry, and Luke Tomlinson, a longtime pal of Princes William and Harry.
2. In the wake of their arrests, there has been renewed calls for stricter security measures at parliamentary sessions. Critics argue that the incident highlights the need for greater protection against potential threats. However, others say that such measures could infringe upon free speech rights.
3. It remains unclear what motivated the men to interrupt the debate. Some speculate that they may have had personal grievances or political beliefs that led them to take action. Others believe that the group was simply looking to cause chaos and disruption. Regardless of their motivations, it is clear that this event has left many people shaken.
4. As the investigation continues, lawmakers are grappling with questions about how best to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Some suggest that increased surveillance and metal detectors might help deter would-be attackers. Others argue that any additional safety measures must be carefully considered to avoid stifling freedom of expression.
5. Amidst all this uncertainty, one thing is certain: the events of September will leave a lasting impact on British politics. Whether through changes in policy or new approaches to security, the government will undoubtedly face pressure to address the concerns raised by this troubling incident. And as politicians continue to grapple with these issues, the public will remain vigilant, waiting to see what comes next.",mistral7b,1

1. Political tensions continue as court battles over parental access rage on. Despite ongoing debates, there is still no clear consensus on how best to resolve these conflicts. Some argue that curfews and community service orders are necessary if parents refuse to comply with court orders granting access to their children. However, others worry that such measures may not be enough to ensure compliance and may even exacerbate existing problems. As a result, many have called for more comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of these issues.
2. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the impact of court decisions on parent-child relationships. While the law aims to protect children from harm, some argue that it can also lead to unintended consequences. For example, when parents are ordered to pay child support or provide joint custody arrangements, this can put pressure on them financially and emotionally. This pressure can then lead to disputes and legal battles between parents, ultimately resulting in further stress and strain on children's lives. To combat these challenges, some politicians have proposed changes to family laws and policies that would better balance the interests of both parents and children.
3. One potential solution to the issue of parent-child conflict is increased education and counseling services. By providing families with resources to help them navigate these difficult situations, policymakers hope to prevent legal battles before they begin. For instance, some programs offer workshops and training sessions on effective communication skills, conflict resolution techniques, and coping strategies for dealing with stress and anxiety. These programs can be offered at schools, community centers, or through private organizations. Ultimately, by equipping families with the tools they need to manage conflicts and maintain healthy relationships, policymakers believe that fewer court battles will arise in the first place.
4. Another option being considered by political leaders is greater collaboration between different government agencies responsible for child welfare. Currently, responsibility for ensuring that children receive appropriate support and care often falls to multiple departments and agencies, each with its own goals and priorities. By working together more closely, policymakers hope to streamline these processes and improve coordination between different stakeholders involved in a child's life. Specifically, this might involve sharing data and information across agencies, establishing clear guidelines for decision-making, and providing additional funding and resources to support vulnerable children and families.
5. Finally, some experts are calling for greater investment in research on family dynamics and child development. By understanding the factors that contribute to successful parent-child relationships, policymakers may be able to design more targeted interventions and policies that actually make a difference in people's lives. For example, studies have shown that early childhood education and intervention can play a critical role in shaping young people's social, emotional, and academic outcomes. By investing in these programs, policymakers hope to foster healthier, stronger relationships between parents and children and reduce the risk of future conflicts.",mistral7b,1

Title: The Mental Capacity Bill: A Step Toward Better Safeguarding of Medical Treatment

In a move that is being hailed as an important step forward, the UK government is set to introduce a new bill aimed at providing better protections for those who lack mental capacity. Known as the Mental Capacity Bill, the measure seeks to provide clear guidance on how healthcare providers should approach patients who are unable to make decisions about their own care.

At the heart of the bill is the concept of living wills, which are documents where people can state clearly what kind of medical treatment they want to receive if they become severely incapacitated. This could include anything from palliative care to life-support machines. By having these wishes documented ahead of time, patients can have greater peace of mind knowing that their wishes will be respected, even when they cannot communicate them themselves.

The bill has received broad support from charities and other organizations that work closely with individuals who may lack mental capacity. These groups argue that the bill provides much needed clarity and protection for vulnerable patients, many of whom may not otherwise have had their wishes taken into account by healthcare professionals.

""We're really excited about this,"" said one representative from a leading charity that works with individuals who suffer from dementia. ""For too long, we've seen situations where family members or loved ones of people with dementia or other conditions have been left guessing about whether or not the person would have wanted certain treatments. With living wills, patients can have their voices heard and their wishes respected, even if they're no longer able to speak for themselves.""

Supporters of the bill also point out that it could help to prevent unnecessary procedures and treatments, as well as reduce conflicts between healthcare providers and families. When patients have made their wishes known ahead of time, there is less room for disagreement about what constitutes appropriate medical care.

Of course, critics of the bill argue that it could lead to more bureaucracy and red tape, especially for smaller hospitals and clinics. Some worry that healthcare providers may struggle to keep up with the paperwork requirements associated with the bill, particularly if they already have limited staff or resources. However, supporters of the bill believe that these concerns are exaggerated, and that the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Overall, the introduction of the Mental Capacity Bill represents an important step forward for anyone concerned about the rights and welfare of those who may lack mental capacity. By ensuring that patients can have their wishes respected and protected, the bill helps to ensure that everyone receives the best possible care, regardless of their circumstances.",mistral7b,1

The five public sector unions, including Unison, GMB, UCU, NUT and NASUWT, are expected to discuss their concerns over the proposed changes to pensions for local authority employees during the meeting with Mr Prescott on Saturday morning. The union representatives will also have an opportunity to meet with other government ministers and officials throughout the weekend event.

Mr Prescott, who has been a long-standing supporter of trade unions, is likely to listen carefully to the views of these key organizations that represent thousands of council staff across the country. It remains to be seen whether the government will make any concessions or compromises based on the feedback received from the unions.

However, it is clear that the issue of pensions for local authority workers has become a major point of contention between the government and the unions. The planned increase in the retirement age was announced as part of the Chancellor's budget last year and sparked protests from many councils and union branches across the UK.

Critics argue that raising the pension age for council workers could lead to significant cost savings for the government but could have negative effects on morale and recruitment among local authorities. Some also worry that older workers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing working conditions and new technology in the modern workplace.

Despite these concerns, however, the government remains firm in its determination to introduce the pension reforms, arguing that they are necessary to ensure that taxpayers get value for money from the public sector. In response to criticism, ministers have offered to provide additional support and training to help workers cope with the changes.

As political leaders gather in Gateshead to discuss a range of issues facing Britain today, the debate over pensions for council workers is sure to feature prominently on their agenda. With millions of people directly affected by the proposed changes, it will be fascinating to see how this contentious topic unfolds over the coming months.",mistral7b,1

1) Michael Howard, former leader of the Conservative Party, has come out strongly against the Home Secretary's plans for control orders. The Home Secretary's plans, including home detention, have been criticized by many as an infringement upon civil liberties. Howard argued that it is wrong to deprive people of their freedom without due process and that such actions undermine the very principles upon which democracy is based.
2) In his speech at the annual conference of the Conservatives, Howard made it clear that he would never support any measures that could potentially curtail individual freedoms. He stated that it was crucial for the party to uphold the values of personal responsibility and accountability. He also emphasized the importance of protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring that they are treated fairly and justly.
3) Many have praised Howard's stance on the matter. Some argue that it takes courage to stand up for what is right, especially when it comes to matters like civil liberties. They commend him for taking a strong position on this issue and for reminding everyone of why we live in a democratic society. Others, however, have accused Howard of being too soft on terrorism and have called his stance naive.
4) Despite the criticism, Howard remains steadfast in his opposition to the use of control orders. He believes that these powers give the government too much authority over individuals and can lead to abuses of power. He argues that the best way to combat terrorism is through intelligence gathering and cooperation between different countries.
5) This debate highlights the ongoing tension between national security concerns and civil liberties. While there may be legitimate reasons for certain restrictions to be placed upon individuals, there must always be oversight to ensure that these measures are used appropriately. It is important that our leaders remember the value of individual freedom and work to strike a balance between protecting our nation and respecting our rights.",mistral7b,1

Political Scandal: Inadequate Staffing and Efficiency-Oriented Policies Lead to Flawed Immigration Decision Making

In a damning report published by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), it has been revealed that pressure was placed on immigration staff to meet efficiency targets, leading to a flawed decision-making process that resulted in numerous errors and wrongful denials of applications. The PAC found that every officer was required to process 8,000 applications per year, which amounted to 40 applications each day or one application every eleven minutes. This policy prioritized speed over accuracy, leading to a systemic problem where applicants were often denied due to technicalities or oversights.

The committee's findings have sparked outrage among political leaders and advocates for immigrants' rights. Many are calling for changes to current policies and increased funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that staff is adequately trained and supported to handle the complex and sensitive nature of immigration cases. Some have even called for the resignation of DHS Secretary John Kelly, who has been criticized for his handling of the department's budget cuts and staff reductions.

Immigrant rights activists are also demanding greater transparency and accountability from DHS regarding its decision-making processes. They argue that the agency must provide clear reasons why certain applications are being denied and offer opportunities for appeal and review. The PAC's findings suggest that this may not currently be the case, as staff is under significant pressure to meet performance targets without adequate resources or support.

As the debate rages on about the future of immigration policy in the United States, it remains unclear how long it will take for DHS to implement meaningful reforms and address the systemic issues outlined in the PAC's report. However, one thing is clear: the current approach to immigration decision making is unsustainable, inefficient, and ultimately harmful to both individuals and families seeking refuge in the United States.",mistral7b,1

Title: MPs approve controversial anti-terror bill despite Labour defeat

The House of Commons has approved a highly controversial piece of legislation aimed at preventing terror attacks, despite facing opposition from Labour MPs and concerns raised by human rights groups.

After weeks of intense debate, the government's Prevention of Terrorism Bill was passed on Tuesday night by 309 votes to 275, with only three Conservatives voting against it. This marks a significant victory for Home Secretary Theresa May and Prime Minister David Cameron, who have faced criticism over the bill's proposed measures to increase police surveillance powers and restrict civil liberties.

However, Labour's majority in the House of Commons has been reduced to just 14 seats following the vote. This means that any future legislation could be blocked if Labour were able to unite its members and gain support from other political parties or even individual Conservative MPs.

The Prevention of Terrorism Bill has sparked controversy due to its provisions for mandatory life imprisonment without parole for certain terrorist offences and the use of secret evidence and closed hearings in legal proceedings. There are also fears that the bill could be used to target individuals based solely on their race, religion, or political beliefs.

Despite these concerns, the bill was backed by many MPs, including former home secretary Charles Clarke, who played a crucial role in securing its passage. However, he had to agree to several key changes after coming under pressure from opponents. One major concession involved removing the power for police to detain suspects for up to 28 days without charge, which had earlier been seen as a violation of civil liberties.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who led the opposition to the bill during his time as shadow home secretary, welcomed the changes made by Clarke but warned that the final version still represented a dangerous erosion of basic freedoms. He said that the bill should not be passed until there is proper scrutiny of its potential impact on civil liberties and the rule of law.

Meanwhile, the bill now faces further challenges from members of the House of Lords, who will begin examining it in detail in the next few months. Peers are particularly concerned about the bill's proposals for house arrest, which they fear could be abused to silence dissenting voices and undermine democratic processes.

As the debate rages on, it remains clear that this issue will continue to divide opinion both inside and outside parliament. While some see the need for stronger measures to combat terrorism, others worry that such steps may go too far and threaten our fundamental freedoms. Ultimately, the fate of this contentious bill will depend on whether politicians can find a balance between security and liberty.",mistral7b,1

Legislature passes historic bill to end primogeniture in UK

In a landmark move, the British parliament has passed a law that will end primogeniture, the longstanding tradition under which males are given preference over females when it comes to succession to the monarchy. The new legislation is set to change the centuries-old order and pave the way for a more egalitarian approach to succession.

Under the proposed reforms, male heirs with older sisters will no longer be able to inherit the throne. This marks a significant departure from past practices where the eldest son was always considered as the natural choice for the role. Instead, the new legislation puts an emphasis on merit and suitability, regardless of gender or family background.

However, the bill faced fierce opposition from conservative groups who argued that the change could destabilize the royal family and undermine its authority. Despite these concerns, the government maintained that the time had come for a modernization of the monarchic system and that the changes were necessary to reflect contemporary values and beliefs.

Another key aspect of the new legislation is the abolition of the ban on marriage between members of the royal family and Roman Catholic heirs. This provision, known as the Act of Union, has been a contentious issue for many years and has led to several high-profile scandals involving the royal family.

By repealing this archaic rule, the government hopes to bring the royal family into the 21st century and allow for greater flexibility and diversity in future generations. However, critics argue that lifting the ban may lead to further intermarriage among the European nobility, potentially diluting the unique cultural heritage of Britain.

Overall, the passage of this historic bill represents a major shift in traditional monarchic practices in the UK. While it remains to be seen how the new laws will play out in practice, it is clear that the country is moving towards a more progressive and inclusive vision for its political institutions.",mistral7b,1

Nick Griffin, the leader of Britain First Party, has been arrested by West Yorkshire Police on Tuesday morning for suspected incitement to commit racial hatred. According to the party's spokesperson, the arrest happened at his home and he is being questioned by detectives. It is not clear yet what specific comments or actions led to his arrest, but it comes as a result of an investigation that began after a video posted online showed him making inflammatory remarks against Muslims. The video went viral and sparked widespread outrage, leading many people to call for legal action against Griffin.

Griffin has a long history of controversial statements and actions, including calling for a ban on Muslim women wearing burkinis on UK beaches and advocating for the expulsion of all foreign nationals. He has also been accused of hate crimes in the past, although he has never been convicted of any such offenses.

Politics is a fascinating field that encompasses a wide range of topics, including international relations, domestic policies, and social justice issues. One hotly debated topic in recent years has been the treatment of migrant children who arrive at the border without their parents or guardians. In response to this crisis, many governments have implemented measures to address the issue. However, these efforts are often met with criticism and opposition from various stakeholders, leading to ongoing political battles over the best course of action.

One such measure being proposed by several countries is the use of trial schemes to determine the fate of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. While this approach may seem like an effective solution, it has sparked controversy among human rights advocates, who argue that it amounts to forcible removal and could lead to further harm to vulnerable children. This article will explore the implications of using trial schemes as a means of dealing with unaccompanied minor migration, as well as the arguments both in favor of and against this approach.

Proponents of trial schemes argue that they provide a fair and objective way to decide the fate of unaccompanied minors, who may otherwise be returned to dangerous environments where they face abuse or exploitation. Additionally, supporters claim that these schemes can help reduce the backlog of cases and ensure that resources are allocated more efficiently. For example, the United Kingdom recently announced plans to introduce a new system that would allow unaccompanied minors to apply for asylum on grounds of persecution, trafficking, or family ties, rather than simply relying on age assessments. Under this proposal, children aged between 16 and 18 would be able to seek asylum through a streamlined process, while younger children would still need to undergo medical examinations and interviews to determine their eligibility for protection. Supporters of this approach believe that it provides greater clarity and consistency in the decision-making process, and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies that could potentially endanger the lives of vulnerable children.

However, opponents of trial schemes argue that they are fundamentally flawed, and do not take into account the unique needs and vulnerabilities of unaccompanied minors. Critics contend that these schemes prioritize legal technicalities over the welfare of individual children, and fail to adequately protect them from harm. They also argue that trial schemes create uncertainty and instability for children, as they must navigate complex legal procedures and face the possibility of separation or deportation. Furthermore, critics warn that these schemes could exacerbate existing problems of child trafficking and exploitation, as unscrupulous individuals could target vulnerable children and exploit them for profit.

Another major concern raised by opponents of trial schemes is the potential impact on children's charities, who fear that the expansion of trial schemes could strain their already limited resources and divert attention away from more pressing child welfare issues. As one charity representative stated: ""We're worried that if we spend all our time and energy fighting for unaccompanied children, we won't have enough left over to support kids living in poverty and struggling families."" By diverting resources away from these critical areas, proponents worry that trial schemes could undermine the broader mission of protecting and supporting children in need.

As the debate over trial schemes continues, many governments and organizations remain committed to finding innovative solutions to the challenges posed by unaccompanied minor migration. Some have explored alternative approaches, such as increased funding for refugee resettlement programs or the creation of safe havens within neighboring countries where children can receive protection and support. Others have sought to improve coordination and information sharing across borders, to better identify and respond to instances of child migration and trafficking. Despite these efforts, however, the problem remains acute, and the political tensions surrounding trial schemes reflect the deep divisions that exist within the international community on how best to address it.

In light of these concerns, it seems clear that any trial scheme designed to deal with unaccompanied minor migration should be approached with caution and sensitivity. While such schemes may offer some benefits, they cannot replace the fundamental responsibility of states to protect and care for children, especially those who arrive at the border without adequate support or representation. Ultimately, any successful strategy for addressing this issue will require a comprehensive and collaborative effort from governments, NGOs, and civil society alike, grounded in principles of child rights, human dignity, and compassion.",mistral7b,1

Political News:

The current voter registration process has been called into question by election officials due to several mistakes that have occurred in recent elections. According to the Electoral Commission, these mistakes are largely caused by a system where only one person in each household applies for voting forms on behalf of all occupants.

This practice is known as proxy voting, and it has been used in many countries for decades. However, it can be problematic when it comes to ensuring accurate voter rolls and preventing fraudulent activity. For example, if someone living in the same household as an eligible voter fails to apply for a form or submits incorrect information, it could result in that individual being unable to vote in upcoming elections.

To address this issue, election officials are proposing changes to the voter registration system. Instead of having just one person in each household apply for voting forms, they suggest allowing individuals to register themselves. This would require every eligible citizen to provide their own personal details and ensure that their names are correctly entered onto the voter roll.

Supporters of this proposal argue that enabling people to register individually will help reduce errors and prevent fraud. By requiring voters to submit their own information, there will be less room for misunderstandings or mistakes to occur. Additionally, it would make it more difficult for anyone to intentionally falsify voter records or manipulate the results of an election.

Critics of the proposed change argue that it would create additional administrative burden for both election officials and voters. They worry that individuals who may not have access to technology or transportation might struggle to register themselves online. Additionally, there is concern that the new system could disproportionately affect certain groups, such as those living in rural areas or those with mobility issues.

Despite these concerns, the Electoral Commission remains committed to implementing the proposed changes to the voter registration system. They believe that the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks and that enabling citizens to register individually will help strengthen democracy and ensure fairness in future elections.",mistral7b,1

The National Audit Office has published its annual report on adult education and training in England. The review found that ministers have made significant progress towards their goal of improving access to learning opportunities for adults. However, despite reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults gaining basic qualifications by this year, the government needs to come up with creative ideas to meet the target of 1.5 million more people acquiring these qualifications by 2010.

One of the key challenges facing the government is the need to address the skills gap in certain industries. According to the NAO, the number of young people studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects at GCSE level has been falling over the past few years. This trend could lead to a shortage of qualified workers in these fields, which would be detrimental to the economy as a whole. To tackle this issue, the government should consider introducing incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies for companies that invest in STEM education programs.

Another challenge is the need to ensure that all adults who wish to gain qualifications can access them regardless of their age, background, or geographic location. Currently, there are significant disparities between urban and rural areas when it comes to access to education. The NAO recommends that the government develop targeted initiatives to improve education outcomes in disadvantaged communities. For example, providing free tuition fees or financial assistance to low-income individuals may help to bridge the gap.

Furthermore, the NAO highlighted concerns about quality assurance in vocational education. While many employers are satisfied with the skills of graduates from vocational courses, the NAO found evidence suggesting that students' performance was not always consistent across different institutions offering similar courses. To address this issue, the government should establish a national accreditation agency to set standards for vocational education providers and monitor compliance.

In summary, while the government has made significant progress towards increasing access to education for adults, much work remains to be done. Addressing skill gaps in specific industries, ensuring equal access to education regardless of age, location, or socioeconomic status, and enhancing the quality of vocational education will require creative solutions and sustained efforts from policymakers. By doing so, they can create a more skilled and prosperous society for everyone.",mistral7b,1

The shadow cabinet has announced its support for a controversial bill that would make ID cards mandatory across the UK. The announcement comes just days before MPs will vote on the legislation in the House of Commons.

Labour leader Keir Starmer said he was pleased to see his team back the measure, which is designed to reduce crime and prevent illegal immigration. He added: ""This bill is long overdue and will help keep our country safe from those who seek to exploit our openness and hospitality.""

However, not all members of the Labour Party are happy with the move. Some MPs have raised concerns about civil liberties and the potential misuse of personal data by authorities. Others fear that requiring people to carry an ID card could lead to discrimination against certain groups.

Despite these reservations, it appears that the majority of the shadow cabinet supports the bill. A spokesperson for Mr Starmer confirmed that his office had been involved in discussions surrounding the legislation and that they were satisfied with the measures being put forward.

Meanwhile, Conservative sources tell the BBC that there was a tough meeting between senior Tories earlier this week where some argued strongly against the introduction of compulsory ID. It remains unclear whether any changes to the bill will be made as a result of this debate.

If passed, the bill will require every adult living in the UK to carry an ID card, which can only be used for identification purposes. Supporters argue that this will improve security and allow police forces to identify criminals more quickly. Opponents say that it will infringe upon individual freedoms and create unnecessary bureaucracy.

As the Commons prepares to vote on the bill, tensions within both parties are likely to continue to simmer. For now though, it seems clear that the government will press on with the legislation despite opposition from some quarters.",mistral7b,1

The Conservatives have been under fire for their failure to publish a White Paper outlining their policy on European Union membership. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram has defended this decision by claiming that it is part of an attempt to avoid alienating public opinion before a referendum on the EU constitution. However, these comments have been met with skepticism from many political observers. Some believe that the lack of clarity over Conservative policy is evidence of confusion and uncertainty within the party. Others argue that it is simply a tactic designed to delay meaningful discussions until after the upcoming election.

Ancram's comments come as tensions between Britain and its EU partners continue to rise. The government has faced criticism from Brussels for refusing to sign up to key elements of the proposed constitution, including proposals to increase the power of the EU parliament. This has led to fears that Britain may face isolation within the bloc if negotiations fail to make progress.

Despite these concerns, the government remains committed to holding a referendum on the EU constitution at some point in the future. It has already announced plans to consult on the issue, although these are likely to be delayed until after next year's general election. In the meantime, officials will continue to work behind the scenes to negotiate a deal that meets Britain's needs while keeping the country firmly within the EU fold.

However, the shadow foreign secretary's comments suggest that there may be more to this than meets the eye. Ancram claimed that the White Paper would help to clarify the Conservative position on the EU, but critics have questioned whether such a document could ever truly provide certainty in this area. They have also suggested that the government's reluctance to engage in open debate reflects a fear of being exposed on sensitive issues like immigration and economic integration.

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has dismissed these claims, insisting that the Tories are simply running scared of engaging in serious discussion about Europe. He argued that the government should be transparent and open about its policies, rather than hiding behind vague statements and ambiguous documents. By doing so, he said, it can build trust with voters and ensure that they feel confident in its ability to represent them effectively in Brussels.

Despite the ongoing debate, however, the question of what the Conservative party actually wants to do with the UK's relationship with the EU remains unclear. Many politicians believe that the Tories are struggling to find their footing on this issue, having spent much of their time attacking Labour's record on Europe without offering any clear alternative vision themselves. As a result, they are seen by some as weak and indecisive when compared to other parties in the region.

In contrast, other political groups have made their positions on this issue clear. For example, the Liberal Democrats have pledged to vote against the proposed EU constitution unless significant changes are made to address concerns about democratic accountability and human rights. Meanwhile, the Green Party has called for the UK to leave the EU altogether, arguing that it cannot support a system based on centralised authority and bureaucracy.

Given these competing views, it remains to be seen how the Conservative party will ultimately approach the referendum on the EU constitution. While Ancram's comments may offer some insight into the party's thinking, many analysts believe that the final decision will depend on a range of factors - including internal politics, external pressures, and public opinion polls. Only then will we know which direction the Tories are really heading in.",mistral7b,1

Former foreign secretary Lord Hague has expressed his frustration with the current state of British politics.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hague said: ""I think we need a different approach. We need people to put aside their personal ambitions and work together for the good of our country.""

Title: The Rise and Fall of Quangos Under Blair Government

The creation of quangos, or non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), has long been a contentious issue in British politics. During Tony Blair's tenure as Prime Minister from 1997 to 2007, the number of quangos grew significantly, with at least 111 being established under his government. However, the rise in quangos was not without controversy, as some critics claimed they were unnecessary, wasteful, and undemocratic.

Dan Lewis, the author of an essential guide to British quangos published in 2005, was one such critic. In an interview with The Guardian, he argued that there should be a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. ""The problem with quangos is that they can become unaccountable,"" Lewis said. ""They are often created for political reasons rather than to achieve a specific policy goal, which means that they can end up becoming bureaucratic and wasteful.""

Lewis also pointed out that many quangos lack transparency and accountability, making it difficult for citizens to hold them accountable for their actions. This lack of oversight led to concerns about corruption and mismanagement within these organizations.

Despite these criticisms, the Blair government continued to create new quangos throughout its time in office. Some of the most controversial included the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and the Children's Rights Directorate for England (CRDE). The IPCC was established in response to the Stephen Lawrence murder case, but it faced criticism for being too lenient on police officers who made mistakes. Meanwhile, the CRDE was tasked with promoting children's rights across England, but it struggled to gain traction and make real change.

In recent years, the number of quangos has begun to decline under successive governments. David Cameron's coalition government abolished several quangos during his time in office, including the Regional Development Agencies and the UK Film Council. Boris Johnson's Conservative administration also took steps to streamline the process for creating new quangos, requiring more justification for each body before it is established.

However, despite these efforts to reform the system, questions remain about the effectiveness and efficiency of quangos as a whole. Many argue that they serve no useful purpose beyond providing employment opportunities for civil servants, while others claim that they can play a vital role in tackling complex social issues. As policymakers continue to grapple with this issue, it remains to be seen what the future holds for quangos in Britain.",mistral7b,1

Title: Asylum Reform Plans Unveiled by the Government; Mr Howard Says it will Help Stop People Smugglers

Subtitle: The government has announced its plan to curb illegal immigration through stricter asylum policies.

The Australian government recently released its detailed asylum reform plans, which aim to reduce illegal immigration and break up people smuggling rings. According to Prime Minister John Howard, these measures are essential for maintaining a fair and just immigration system. He stated that the new policy would help prevent abuse of the refugee program and ensure that legitimate refugees receive the support they need.

Under this plan, there will be an annual cap on asylum seekers who can enter Australia directly from offshore countries. All applications will also have to be processed abroad before being approved or denied. This move is expected to significantly cut down on the number of unauthorized immigrants arriving at our shores, making it much harder for criminals like people smugglers to operate their businesses.

Mr. Howard further explained how this measure aligns perfectly with the international community's efforts against human trafficking and modern slavery. By processing claims overseas, we can work closely with foreign governments to identify potential threats and prevent them from entering our country. Moreover, doing so ensures that refugees are resettled in places where they have better chances of finding safety and stability.

However, not everyone agrees with these changes. Opposition parties argue that restricting entry could lead to more dangerous situations for genuine refugees caught up in violent conflicts or persecution back home. They believe that such individuals should still be able to apply for asylum once they arrive here. But proponents of the new policy maintain that it strikes a balance between compassion and security while ensuring the long-term sustainability of Australia's migration intake.

In addition to tightening asylum rules, the government is also investing heavily into improving border control technologies and strengthening partnerships with neighboring nations. These initiatives are designed to make it even harder for those seeking illegally to enter or stay in Australia.

Despite criticism, Prime Minister Howard remains confident that his party's approach will ultimately prevail. He believes that strong borders and responsible immigration policies are key ingredients for maintaining public trust and confidence in the federal government. Furthermore, he hopes that other countries might follow suit and adopt similar systems to combat illegal immigration effectively.

This announcement marks a significant turning point in Australia's immigration policy landscape. It comes amid rising concerns over immigration-related crimes, including terrorism and organized crime, which have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. With these new measures, the Australian government aims to create a safer and more secure future for its citizens while upholding its commitment to providing assistance to genuine refugees.",mistral7b,1

Political Parties Urge ICO to End Political Call Campaigns During Election Period
===============================================================

During election periods, political campaigns often resort to making unsolicited phone calls to voters as a way of promoting their message and rallying support. However, these calls have been met with criticism from those who believe they violate privacy laws and disrupt personal lives. As a result, many politicians are calling on the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to end such campaigns altogether.

The main concern raised by critics is that the calls made during election periods are often used to gather information about voters' opinions and intentions, which could then be used to influence their vote. While the law states that such activity must be conducted within certain parameters, it has still sparked controversy among both political parties and the public alike. In recent years, there have been several cases where individuals have complained that they were being harassed or subjected to unwanted intrusion due to these calls.

In response to this issue, several political parties have called on the ICO to take action to ensure that campaign calls adhere to the relevant regulations. They argue that while it may be acceptable to make occasional contact with potential voters during an election period, any attempts at soliciting votes or gathering information should be done so in accordance with data protection laws. This would help to prevent abuse of the system and protect vulnerable individuals from unwelcome intrusions into their private lives.

One example of a party taking steps to address this issue is the Liberal Democrats. The party has recently written to the ICO requesting that they consider ending all campaign call activities during election periods. According to their statement, they believe that such calls are an invasion of people's privacy and cause unnecessary disruption to their daily lives. By removing these calls entirely, the Lib Dems hope to create a more level playing field and encourage greater voter engagement without resorting to intrusive tactics.

However, other parties have been less vocal in their opposition to campaign calls. Some have argued that such activities are necessary in order to promote democracy and engage potential voters, particularly in marginal constituencies where every vote counts. Others have suggested that rather than banning calls outright, stricter regulations should be put in place to ensure that they are conducted in a respectful manner.

Despite differing views, it seems clear that the use of campaign calls during election periods will continue to be a contentious issue in the coming years. With increasing concerns about data privacy and the impact of technology on our personal lives, it is likely that we will see further debate and discussion about what constitutes acceptable campaign practices. Ultimately, only time will tell whether political parties can find a balance between engaging with voters and protecting their rights.",mistral7b,1

Article 1: The Scottish Conservative Leader, Douglas Ross, has resigned from his position at law firm Tods Murray following allegations of conflicts of interest. Mr. Ross had previously insisted that his work with the firm did not affect the political views he held, but after further investigation, he has now decided to step down. In his statement, Mr. Ross said, ""I am deeply disappointed by these developments and will do everything within my power to ensure a smooth transition.""

Article 2: The controversy surrounding Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, deepened this week as she faced calls for an independent investigation into her handling of the Salmond affair. Ms. Sturgeon has been accused of covering up sexual harassment claims made against former First Minister Alex Salmond while she was in charge of the Scottish Government. The SNP has called for a review into its procedures regarding such cases, but opponents say it is too late to prevent further damage to the party's reputation.

Article 3: A group of MPs from different parties are calling for a new electoral system in the UK. They argue that the current first-past-the-post system is outdated and fails to reflect the diversity of opinion in the country. The proposal would see votes counted using proportional representation, which would allow smaller parties to gain more seats. Supporters of the plan hope it will lead to a more inclusive parliament that better represents the views of all voters.

Article 4: The ongoing Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU have reached another stalemate. Despite recent talks, both sides remain far apart on key issues such as trade agreements and border controls. Some politicians have called for a second referendum on Brexit, while others believe the best way forward is to negotiate a no-deal agreement. As the deadline for Brexit approaches, tensions continue to rise on both sides of the Channel.

Article 5: President Trump's impeachment trial began this week, with the Senate hearing evidence against him. Democrats argue that Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed justice during his time in office. The president denies any wrongdoing and argues that he was simply exercising his constitutional rights. The outcome of the trial is uncertain, but it could have significant implications for American politics and the world beyond.

Labour Party Proposes Pension Reforms To Save Money And Prevent Winter Deaths

The Labour Party has proposed a major shake-up of the state pension system in order to save money and prevent winter deaths among older people. Under the new plans, which have been welcomed by pensioners' groups, the government would give an additional £5 billion per year towards pensions, allowing it to increase the basic state pension to at least £144.

This move, which comes ahead of this autumn's Budget, is expected to benefit more than eight million pensioners in the UK. According to estimates by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), increasing the basic state pension to £144 would see an extra 2.7 million people lifted out of poverty. In addition, the government will provide a one-off payment of £300 to all over-80s during the coldest months of the year, worth approximately £9 million in total.

""Our reforms will help millions of hardworking pensioners get a fair deal,"" said Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell. ""By giving our oldest citizens the support they deserve, we can also reduce winter deaths and ensure that no one goes hungry this coming winter.""

However, critics argue that such measures may not be enough to tackle the root causes of poverty among elderly people, who often struggle with healthcare costs, housing issues and social isolation. Nevertheless, the Labour Party insists that its plan represents a significant step forward in addressing these problems.",mistral7b,1

1. The UK government has announced plans to expand its crackdown on antisocial behavior in more towns and cities across England. This comes after ten areas have already been subjected to special prosecutors, local expertise, and other measures aimed at reducing crime rates.
2. As part of this expansion, details of how many anti-social behavior orders (Asbos) were used in the last year will be made public for the first time. This move is intended to provide greater transparency and accountability for law enforcement agencies and their efforts to tackle criminal activity.
3. The announcement was welcomed by community groups who have long called for increased resources and support from the government to combat antisocial behavior and reduce crime rates in their communities. However, critics argue that such measures may not always lead to a reduction in criminal activity and could instead create resentment among certain segments of the population.
4. In addition to expanding its crackdown on antisocial behavior, the government has also introduced new measures aimed at tackling online bullying and harassment. These include stricter penalties for cyberbullying offenses and improved collaboration between law enforcement agencies and social media platforms to identify and remove harmful content.
5. Despite these efforts, however, concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of the current approach to addressing antisocial behavior and reducing crime rates. Some critics argue that the focus should shift towards preventative measures rather than reactive responses, such as providing better education and mental health services for individuals at risk of becoming involved in criminal activity.
6. Meanwhile, political leaders continue to debate the best way forward to address these complex issues. Some argue that increased funding for police departments and social programs would go a long way towards reducing crime rates and improving quality of life for citizens. Others, however, believe that reforms to existing policies and laws are needed to ensure that justice is served fairly and effectively.
7. Regardless of where people stand on the issue, it's clear that addressing antisocial behavior and reducing crime rates remains a top priority for governments around the world. With ongoing efforts to improve policing techniques, collaborate with community organizations, and implement effective prevention strategies, there is hope that progress can be made in combating these challenging issues.",mistral7b,1

Kennedy Calls For Phased Withdrawal Of UK Troops From Iraq

LONDON - In his first public address since returning to the UK, former president John F. Kennedy has called for a phased withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. Speaking at a conference organized by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Mr. Kennedy said that while Britain's involvement in the war was necessary, it should be wound down as soon as possible to avoid further casualties and instability in the region.
""The decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one,"" he said, ""but we must now focus our efforts on finding a peaceful solution to this conflict. We cannot allow it to drag on forever, or risk creating more chaos than there already is.""
Mr. Kennedy also spoke out against the use of torture by US forces in detention centers in Iraq, saying that such tactics were counterproductive and only served to undermine American credibility in the eyes of the world.
He added: ""Iraq has become a crucible of militant terrorism, and we must work together to root out these extremist elements before they can pose a threat to us all.""
While Mr. Kennedy did not offer specific timelines for withdrawing British troops, he said that any withdrawal should be done gradually and carefully, taking into account the needs of local authorities and the safety of British citizens.",mistral7b,1

An article titled ""Blair and Brown clash over civil service cuts"" published by The Guardian reported that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his successor Gordon Brown had a heated dispute over civil service cuts during their tenure. According to the report, Jonathan Baume, who represented the top civil servants' union, stated that there were ""competing agendas"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair when it came to reducing the size of the public sector workforce. However, Chancellor George Osborne denied any involvement in such discussions and asserted that he only became aware of the proposed reductions after they had been agreed upon.
In an interview conducted by Sky News, Mr Baume explained that he believed that both Mr Blair and Mr Brown had different priorities when it came to managing the civil service. While Mr Blair focused on maintaining political stability and delivering policy initiatives, Mr Brown prioritized economic growth and reducing government spending. As a result, the two leaders often found themselves competing for resources and influence within the civil service.
Mr Baume also revealed that he had attended several meetings between Mr Blair and Mr Brown to discuss potential reforms to the civil service. However, he admitted that he did not have direct access to either leader and could only provide feedback based on what he observed from afar. Despite this limitation, Mr Baume emphasized the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between politicians and civil servants to ensure effective governance.
The ongoing debate over civil service cuts has become increasingly contentious in recent years. With the UK facing significant budget deficits and economic challenges, many policymakers have called for reductions in public sector spending as a way to address these issues. However, critics argue that such cuts could lead to job losses, reduced services, and a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise within the civil service.
As the chancellor continues to push for greater fiscal discipline and efficiency within the civil service, he is likely to face opposition from unions like Mr Baume's, which represent the interests of civil servants and seek to protect their jobs and working conditions. In the coming weeks and months, the fate of the UK civil service will continue to be shaped by political decisions and choices made by policymakers and civil servant leaders alike.",mistral7b,1

Title: Flawed research blamed for Scottish government's flagship health policy

A new report from the Fraser of Allander Institute has revealed that the Scottish government's flagship health policy, which aimed to improve mental health care, was based on flawed research. The report found that the research used to inform the policy was not robust enough and did not take into account the views of those who would be most affected by it.

The Scottish government has been under fire for its approach to mental health care in recent years, with many experts criticising the lack of resources and support available to those struggling with their mental health. This latest report only serves to strengthen these concerns, as it suggests that the government may have rushed to implement a policy without fully understanding the potential consequences.

Deputy Health Minister Rhona Branklin has pledged to study the research behind the policy, in an effort to ensure that similar mistakes are not made in future. She said: ""We understand the importance of having strong evidence when it comes to making decisions about our health system, and we will do everything in our power to make sure that this policy is informed by the best possible research. We will also engage with stakeholders more effectively in order to better understand the needs of those who use our services.""

However, critics argue that the damage has already been done. They say that the government should have taken more time to scrutinise the research before implementing such a far-reaching policy. One expert, Dr Jane Campbell, commented: ""It is disappointing that the government appears to have rushed to implement this policy without properly considering the evidence. Mental health care is too important to be treated lightly, and it is crucial that we get it right first time round.""

As Scotland continues to grapple with issues surrounding mental health care, there remains much work to be done. While the government has committed to studying the research behind this particular policy, they must also address wider concerns about the state of mental health services in Scotland. Only then can they hope to build a brighter future for all those living with mental illnesses.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:
The prime minister has been facing criticism from many quarters regarding his strained relationship with Gordon Brown. However, with the upcoming general election, he is now focusing on improving the economy rather than addressing these issues. In a recent interview, he stated that prosperity can only be achieved by increasing individual wealth as well as providing better public services. This statement was seen as an effort to address the concerns of voters who are worried about their financial stability as well as access to quality healthcare and education. The prime minister's focus on economic growth has sparked hope among businesses and investors, who believe that the UK will soon regain its position as one of the world's leading economies. With just weeks remaining before polling day, it remains to be seen whether this message will resonate with voters and help secure the Conservatives' re-election.

Article 2:
In an attempt to put rumors surrounding his relationship with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to rest, the current leader delivered a speech in Chatham, Kent. During his speech, he emphasized the importance of achieving prosperity for individuals and society as a whole. While acknowledging that economic growth was essential for this goal, he also highlighted the need to invest in public services to ensure that everyone had equal opportunities to succeed. Despite ongoing debate over the best way to achieve these objectives, there is no denying that the prime minister's focus on prosperity has captured the attention of many voters. As they prepare to cast their ballots in the upcoming election, it seems likely that economic growth and public service delivery will remain key priorities for both political parties.

Article 3:
With less than a month left until the UK goes to the polls, the prime minister has taken steps to reassure voters that his government is committed to delivering real improvements in public services. In his latest speech, which focused on economic growth and job creation, he made clear that investing in infrastructure, education, and healthcare was crucial for long-term success. By highlighting examples of successful projects already underway across the country, he demonstrated that his government was not simply talking the talk but walking the walk when it came to improving public services. While some critics have accused him of being too focused on economic growth at the expense of social responsibility, there is little doubt that his efforts to create a thriving and prosperous nation will continue to inspire voters in the coming days.

Overall, it appears that the prime minister is determined to use his time in power to make a lasting impact on the UK's economy and society. Whether or not this approach will ultimately lead to victory for the Conservative Party remains uncertain, but there is no question that he has proven himself to be a strong and capable leader who is dedicated to serving the interests of his constituents.",mistral7b,1

1. The UK government is facing calls from opposition parties to reopen an investigation into the granting of permanent residency status to Lord Adonis's former lover, Leoncia Casalme. This comes after it was revealed that there had been a ""chain of events"" linking Lord Adonis to Ms Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain in the country.



2. The Tories and the Liberal Democrats are leading the charge for a fresh probe into the matter, arguing that the previous investigation by Home Office officials had not gone far enough in uncovering all the facts surrounding the decision to grant permanent residency to Ms Casalme.



3. The original investigation, carried out by Sir Alan Budd, had concluded that no evidence could be found to suggest that Lord Adonis had played any role in the granting of permanent residence to his former lover. However, this ruling has been challenged by opposition politicians who argue that the investigation did not go deep enough into the background circumstances surrounding Mr Blunkett's relationship with Ms Casalme.



4. The Tory MP, David Davis, said: ""It is clear that we need to look at this issue again. We cannot simply accept the findings of Sir Alan Budd without further investigation."" He added that he believed that Lord Adonis should face questions over his involvement in Ms Casalme's application process and that it would be wrong if he continued to hold office while these issues were still being probed.



5. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, also spoke out against the government's handling of the case, saying that the initial investigation had been insufficiently thorough. He argued that more needed to be done to ensure transparency and accountability when dealing with high-profile cases like this one.



6. The call for another inquiry came as the controversy surrounding the granting of permanent residency to Ms Casalme continues to rage on. Many critics have accused the government of using its influence to expedite the application process, which they say amounts to corruption and undermines trust in the political system.



7. Despite the growing pressure to launch a new investigation, the home secretary has so far refused to do so. In response to criticism, she has pointed out that the original investigation had cleared Lord Adonis of any wrongdoing and that the government was committed to upholding the rule of law.



8. But opponents are not convinced. They believe that there is evidence suggesting that Lord Adonis may have used his influence to help Ms Casalme secure her residency status faster than she might otherwise have been able to do. They also point to concerns raised by other politicians who have suggested that there was a conflict of interest at play in the decision to grant Ms Casalme permanent residency.



9. As the debate rages on, many observers are calling for greater scrutiny of the government's dealings with high-profile individuals. Some have even suggested that the government should introduce a code of conduct for ministers that outlines what they can and cannot do when dealing with friends or lovers in their personal lives.



10. Whatever happens next, it is clear that the granting of permanent residency status to Lord Adonis's former lover will continue to dominate political headlines for the foreseeable future. With the ongoing investigation into the matter, it looks like the controversy is set to drag on for some time yet.",mistral7b,1

Mrs. Parker Bowles and Prince Charles have been together for many years now, but their relationship has faced several challenges along the way, including public skepticism and controversy over their divorce settlements. However, it seems that the two are finally putting aside their differences and moving forward towards a new chapter in their lives together. According to recent reports, the couple will get married in a private ceremony at Windsor Castle on April 28th. The event is expected to be attended by close friends and family members only, as well as several dignitaries and other prominent figures from British society.

The announcement of the upcoming wedding was made by Buckingham Palace earlier this week, confirming rumors that had circulated for months. It remains unclear what exactly the ceremony will entail, but one thing is certain: Mrs. Parker Bowles will officially become known as HRH Duchess of Cornwall following her marriage to the Duke of Cornwall, also known as Prince Charles. This change of title is significant because it represents an official recognition of her role in the royal family, as well as her longstanding partnership with the prince.

While there may still be some lingering doubts and reservations among the public, many people are excited to see the happy couple tie the knot once again. A Daily Telegraph poll conducted last month found that two-thirds of Britons supported the idea of the couple marrying, indicating a growing acceptance and appreciation of their relationship. In addition, the poll showed that most respondents believed the royal family should embrace diversity and modernity, suggesting that the upcoming union could be seen as a step in the right direction towards a more inclusive and open monarchy.

Of course, not everyone is thrilled about the prospect of another royal wedding. There are certainly those who view the move as politically motivated or opportunistic, given the current state of affairs within the UK government. Some critics argue that the prime minister, David Cameron, may be using the wedding as a distraction from his own problems or as a way to appease voters who are disillusioned with politics. Others worry that the wedding could lead to further speculation and scrutiny of the royal family's finances and activities, potentially exposing weaknesses or vulnerabilities that they would prefer to keep hidden from the public eye.

Despite these concerns, however, it appears that most people are looking forward to seeing the Duchess of Cornwall formally recognized as part of the royal family. Whether the wedding proves to be a symbolic gesture or a meaningful celebration of love and commitment remains to be seen, but either way it promises to be a memorable occasion for all involved.",mistral7b,1

Politicians are continuing their debate over the government's plans to tackle terrorism and radicalisation in Britain. Hazel Blears, who is the Home Office minister, has been particularly critical of the proposals. She believes that the measures will unfairly target innocent Muslims and lead to discrimination against certain communities.

Ms Blears spoke out during a parliamentary inquiry into the issue, saying: ""We have got to be very careful not to create an atmosphere where people feel that they are being stigmatised or discriminated against on the basis of their faith."" She added that it was essential for there to be a balance between protecting national security and upholding civil liberties.

The government has faced criticism from Muslim groups who fear that new laws will make it harder for them to practice their religion freely. They argue that any restrictions should only apply to those individuals who pose a genuine threat to society.

One of the main concerns raised by Ms Blears was the possibility of increasing surveillance on mosques and other places of worship. She argued that this would not only infringe upon religious freedom but also risk creating resentment among British Muslims who already feel marginalized and under attack.

""It's important that we don't go down a road where we start treating people as suspects simply because of their beliefs,"" she said. ""That would be a fundamental breach of our values as a democracy.""

Ms Blears also called for greater scrutiny of qualifications required for religious leaders to enter the country. She suggested that stricter checks could help ensure that only moderate and tolerant clergy are allowed to serve here, reducing the risk of radicalization within the community.

Her comments come at a time when tensions between different factions within Islam continue to rise across the world, including here in the UK. Some extremist groups are advocating for violence and intimidation against non-Muslims, while others seek peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.

Despite these challenges, many politicians remain committed to finding ways to promote tolerance and understanding between different religions and cultures. Ms Blears herself acknowledged the importance of fostering good relationships with Muslim communities if the government hopes to succeed in its fight against terrorism.

""If we want to build resilience against extremism, then we need to engage with local communities and listen to their concerns,"" she said. ""By doing so, we can help create a more inclusive and harmonious society.""

In addition to her own efforts, Ms Blears urged her colleagues to work together more closely with Muslim organizations to develop effective strategies for combatting radicalism. This includes providing better resources and support for young people at risk of becoming radicalized, as well as promoting dialogue and interfaith cooperation among community leaders.

As the debate continues over how best to tackle terrorism and extremism in the UK, one thing remains clear - political leaders must remain vigilant and open to feedback from all quarters of society if they hope to find long-term solutions.",mistral7b,1

Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) have formed an alliance aimed at increasing their influence on government policy and employer practices. The union's leaders say that the collaboration will enable them to push for greater rights and benefits for workers and to hold powerful corporations accountable.

""This partnership represents a significant step forward in our efforts to protect the interests of working people,"" said Amicus general secretary Gavin McFadden. ""With the combined might of Amicus and the TGWU behind us, we can make a real difference.""

The move is expected to be welcomed by many workers who have long felt marginalized and powerless. It could also put pressure on businesses that rely heavily on labor to treat employees fairly and respectfully.

However, critics argue that the merger may undermine competition within the labor movement, potentially leading to higher fees and dues for members. They also worry that it could lead to increased bureaucratic complexity, making it harder for ordinary citizens to get involved or participate.

Despite these concerns, supporters of the merger believe that it has the potential to bring about meaningful change and to create a stronger, more united voice for the working class.",mistral7b,1

The United Kingdom has been recognized as one of the top countries in the world when it comes to ICT usage, according to a government-commissioned report. With an impressive ranking third globally, this accolade highlights the country's commitment towards embracing new digital technologies for growth and development.

One key aspect of the report is the high adoption rate of broadband among UK firms. A staggering 69% of companies have already made the switch, demonstrating their willingness to leverage the power of faster internet speeds for increased productivity and efficiency. This shift also indicates the growing importance of connectivity within business operations and underscores the need for continued investment into Britain's digital infrastructure.

Furthermore, the rise of e-commerce among small businesses was another noteworthy finding from the research. Thirty percent of micro enterprises are currently engaging in online trade, showing how technology has transformed traditional brick-and-mortar retail models into thriving digital marketplaces. These statistics serve as evidence of the resilience and adaptability of British entrepreneurs who continue to seize opportunities offered by innovative tools and platforms.

Despite these positive outcomes, there remain challenges ahead that must be addressed if the UK wants to maintain its position at the forefront of technological advancements. For instance, while broadband penetration is relatively high compared to other European nations, there remains significant disparities across regions - particularly in rural areas where access to fast and reliable internet can be sparse. Additionally, concerns over data privacy and cybersecurity threats persist, which could hinder consumer trust and confidence if left unchecked.

Overall, however, the findings suggest that the UK is on the right path towards becoming a truly digitized society, driven by the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit of its people. As such, policymakers should continue to prioritize investments in digital infrastructure and support initiatives aimed at fostering innovation and growth across all sectors of the economy. By doing so, they will help ensure the UK remains competitive and relevant in our increasingly interconnected global landscape.",mistral7b,1

1) In an interview with Sky News, Boris Johnson criticized Tony Blair's leadership as being overly controlling and centralizing power. He argued that this approach had led to a stagnant economy and high levels of social inequality. Johnson also called for more devolution of powers to local governments and greater individual freedom in decision making. His comments sparked a heated debate among political analysts, who were divided on whether Blair's policies were truly responsible for Britain's current economic struggles or if they were simply the result of global market forces.
2) As the new year began, Prime Minister Theresa May delivered her first major policy speech since coming to power. She announced plans to reform the welfare system, including reducing benefits for those deemed able to work but not actively seeking employment. The move has been met with mixed reactions from politicians and members of the public alike. While some see it as a necessary step to address long-term deficits in the welfare system, others fear that it will disproportionately hurt vulnerable groups such as disabled people and single parents.
3) Meanwhile, the ongoing Brexit negotiations have dominated headlines once again. With less than two years until Britain leaves the European Union, there remains much uncertainty about what the future holds for both sides. Some argue that leaving the EU could lead to significant economic gains for Britain, while others warn of dire consequences such as reduced access to international markets and increased immigration pressure. As the deadline approaches, many are calling for more clarity and urgency on all sides to ensure that the best possible outcome can be achieved.
4) Another key issue facing Britain today is the growing divide between rich and poor. According to recent data, income inequality is at its highest level in decades, with the top 1% earning significantly more than the rest of society. This trend has been linked to a variety of factors, including changes in the labor market and reductions in social welfare spending. Many politicians argue that tackling inequality must be a priority for any sustainable form of growth and prosperity in Britain.
5) Finally, concerns about the state of the environment continue to mount. Climate change remains one of the greatest threats facing humanity, and experts believe that urgent action needs to be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate their impact on our planet. However, despite these warnings, progress towards meeting environmental targets set under the Paris Agreement continues to lag behind schedule. Some blame this slow pace on political interference and lack of commitment to the cause, while others point to technical challenges and the need for greater cooperation between nations.",mistral7b,1

The new party is called Veritas (Latin for 'Truth'), which aims to challenge the established political order. Its leader Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party (UKIP), said ""Our country is being stolen from us"" by mass immigration. He made this statement at a press conference held in London.

Veritas has been set up as an alternative to traditional political parties such as Labour and Conservatives. The party promises to provide honest and transparent policies without any lies or spin. It also intends to address issues related to national identity and sovereignty. Mr Kilroy-Silk explained that he left UKIP because of its failure to deliver on key issues such as Brexit and immigration control.

He believes that the current government has not done enough to protect British citizens from foreign influence and interference. He also accused the government of betraying the people by allowing unlimited migration into the country. According to him, immigrants have put a strain on public services and resources, leading to higher taxes for hardworking taxpayers.

In addition to immigration, Veritas plans to focus on other important areas such as economic growth, healthcare, and education. Mr Kilroy-Silk stated that his party will prioritize the needs of British citizens above all else and work towards creating a fairer society where everyone can thrive.

However, critics argue that Veritas may face challenges in gaining popularity due to its lack of experience and limited financial resources. They question whether the party has what it takes to succeed against well-established political groups like the Conservatives and Labour.

Despite these concerns, Mr Kilroy-Silk remains confident in Veritas' ability to make a difference. He emphasized that Veritas represents a new era of politics where transparency and accountability are paramount. He urged voters to support the party and give it a chance to prove itself.

Meanwhile, the mainstream media continues to scrutinize Veritas closely. Some journalists have questioned Mr Kilroy-Silk's credentials and motives, while others have praised the party's commitment to truthfulness and transparency. Regardless of the reaction, one thing is clear: Veritas marks a significant departure from traditional politics in the UK.",mistral7b,1

Title: Controversial CSA Replaced as Politicians Call For Nuclear Option

A controversial child support agency, known as the Child Support Agency (CSA), has been replaced due to a series of issues raised by politicians. The replacement comes after a report by the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee recommended that the CSA should be wound up if improvements were not made within weeks.

The move has sparked mixed reactions among political parties, with many calling for drastic action to address the problems faced by the CSA. Some politicians have argued that the replacement of the CSA is necessary to ensure fairness for both parents involved, while others fear that such a drastic step could lead to chaos in the family court system.

One politician who welcomed the move was Labour MP Sarah Jones, who described it as an important first step towards addressing the challenges facing the CSA. She also expressed her hope that the new agency will provide better services for families affected by the CSA's past mistakes.

However, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen disagreed, arguing that the replacement of the CSA is too radical a step and could cause more harm than good. He warned that the new agency could face similar challenges as the old one and urged caution before making any major changes to the system.

Despite these concerns, there is widespread agreement among political leaders that the CSA needs significant reforms to improve its performance. This includes providing better communication between staff and families, improving accuracy in payments and reducing the number of appeals and disputes that arise from its decisions.

In addition to this, some politicians have suggested that the government consider other options beyond the nuclear option of replacing the entire agency. They have proposed creating a separate body to oversee the CSA and ensuring that all staff are properly trained and supported to deliver effective services to families.

It remains to be seen whether these alternative proposals will gain traction or whether the replacement of the CSA is the only viable solution.

Political leader Sir William Hailsham has passed away aged 84. The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years. He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland.
Hailsham's political journey began when he was elected to parliament at the age of 23 and served for over five decades. During his time in office, he played a key role in several major policy initiatives, including the introduction of free education and the creation of the National Health Service.
In addition to his work in government, Hailsham was a prominent figure in the legal world. He was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1980, a position he held until 1982. He later became president of the Supreme Court and was known for his strong views on human rights.
Despite his many achievements, Hailsham faced criticism during his lifetime for his role in the Windrush scandal. In 2018, it emerged that thousands of people from Commonwealth countries had been wrongly deported or denied entry into Britain due to administrative errors. Hailsham was accused of failing to take sufficient action to address the issue while he was Home Secretary in the late 1970s.
Despite these controversies, Hailsham remained a respected figure in British politics and society. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 2012 for his services to public life. His legacy will be remembered by those who knew him as a passionate advocate for justice and equality.",mistral7b,1

Welsh Health Minister Jane Hutt has announced new targets to improve access to healthcare services in Wales. The minister stated that no patient will have to wait more than twelve months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, which is two years earlier than the current target of eighteen months. This move comes as part of the Welsh Assembly's drive to reduce waiting times and provide better health care for the people of Wales.

Despite this announcement, however, the minister also revealed that the target for an inpatient appointment remains at twelve months. She explained that there are certain medical procedures that require longer periods of hospital stays or intensive treatments, making it difficult to meet shorter waiting times. Nevertheless, Hutt promised to continue working hard towards reducing these wait times and improving overall healthcare access in Wales.

The Welsh government has been under increasing pressure from patients and health groups to address the long waiting times for appointments and treatment. Many people in Wales have reported feeling frustrated and disappointed with the quality and timely delivery of healthcare services. In response, the government has pledged to invest additional funds into the National Health Service (NHS) to hire more staff and increase resources for hospitals and clinics across Wales.

However, critics argue that the funding increases may not be enough to achieve the ambitious goals set by the Welsh government. Some experts estimate that it could take several years for the NHS to recruit and train the necessary number of doctors and nurses required to reduce waiting times significantly. Others point out that the cost-cutting measures implemented by previous governments have left many NHS facilities struggling financially, making it difficult to attract top talent and maintain high standards of care.

In light of these challenges, some politicians have called on the UK government to step in and provide more financial support to the Welsh NHS. They argue that without adequate resources, Wales cannot hope to keep up with its own ambitious healthcare targets or compete with other countries in terms of the quality of care provided. However, the UK government has so far declined to intervene directly, leaving the responsibility for funding and resource allocation squarely within the hands of the Welsh government.

As political leaders debate the best way forward for Wales' healthcare system, one thing is clear: the issue of long waiting times continues to loom large over the country. Despite recent efforts to improve access to services, many people in Wales are still forced to wait far too long for the care they need. With elections due next year, it remains to be seen whether the Welsh government can make significant progress towards meeting its healthcare targets before the ballot boxes open.",mistral7b,1

Politics News: A Positive Test For TB Would Mean Visa Applications Being Turned Down While HIV Would Be Dealt With Case By Case

London - The UK government has announced that it will carry out mandatory medical tests on all immigrants who arrive from countries where tuberculosis (TB) is rampant. This move comes after a series of high-profile cases involving TB patients who have been treated poorly in the country's hospitals.

According to Home Secretary Theresa May, the tests will help prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the UK. She also noted that HIV will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. However, if an immigrant tests positive for TB, their visa application will be turned down immediately.

Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. He added that it was essential to take a tough stance against those seeking to enter the country illegally or without proper documentation.

The decision to implement these checks has received mixed reactions from both sides of the political spectrum. Supporters argue that it is necessary to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of disease. Critics say it could lead to discrimination against legitimate asylum seekers and refugees.

However, there is no denying that TB remains a serious problem in many parts of the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are currently over nine million new cases of TB reported each year. In addition, drug-resistant strains of the disease are becoming increasingly common, making it even more difficult to treat.

It is important to note that not every immigrant will pose a risk to public health. Many come from countries with lower rates of TB infection and may have undergone medical screening before traveling to the UK. Nevertheless, the government must remain vigilant and continue to take steps to protect its citizens from infectious diseases.

One potential solution is to provide better healthcare facilities in the countries from which migrants originate. This could include improving access to TB treatment and reducing the stigma associated with the disease. By doing so, we can reduce the number of people infected with TB and make it easier for them to seek medical care when needed.

In conclusion, the decision to require mandatory medical testing of immigrants arriving in the UK raises important questions about public health and immigration policy. While it is understandable that the government wants to take precautions against the spread of disease, it is equally important to consider the impact on legitimate asylum seekers and refugees. Ultimately, the best way to combat TB and other infectious diseases is through collaboration between governments, non-governmental organizations, and healthcare providers around the world.",mistral7b,1

""Politicians are using mobile phones for more than just making calls. The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send emails. These devices have become popular among politicians because they are easy to use and allow them to stay connected while on the move. This week, however, the devices gained new prominence when former Prime Minister Alastair Campbell accidentally sent an offensive message to a reporter from Newsnight using one of these gadgets. It is unclear what he meant by his message, but it has sparked a debate about whether politicians should be allowed to carry such powerful technology. Some experts believe that the government could introduce regulations to limit the amount of sensitive information that politicians can store or transmit using their handsets.""",mistral7b,1

Politics is a field that has been attracting a lot of attention lately. With recent developments, there have been several changes made to political parties, their leaders, and policies. One such development is the new leadership role taken by Dr Brian Gibbons for Wales's largest political party, Welsh Labour. On his first full day in the job after the resignation of Jane Hutt, Dr Gibbons acknowledged the significant challenges facing him, stating that they are essential to ensure the continued growth of the party. However, not everyone is happy with his new leadership style or his proposed policies.

Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood immediately spoke out against Dr Gibbons and his new direction for Welsh Labour. In an interview, she stated that she believes that Dr Gibbons needs to make significant changes if he wants to be successful as the party's leader. She argued that his policies do not reflect the values and interests of Welsh voters, particularly those who support independence from the UK.

Similarly, the Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds also expressed her concerns regarding Dr Gibbons's new leadership style. While she praised Dr Gibbons's commitment to improving the lives of Welsh people, she warned that his current proposals may not appeal to many voters in the upcoming elections. In particular, she pointed out that Dr Gibbons needs to address issues related to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities.

Despite the criticism from Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats, Dr Gibbons remained confident in his abilities to lead Welsh Labour successfully. He stated that he understands the importance of addressing the needs of Welsh voters and will work hard to implement policies that benefit them. Additionally, he emphasized his commitment to working collaboratively with other politicians and stakeholders to create a brighter future for all of Wales.

However, it remains to be seen whether Dr Gibbons can overcome the opposition to his new leadership style and policies. The upcoming elections could prove to be a test case for his ability to connect with Welsh voters and convince them that his vision for Wales is the right one. Only time will tell how well Dr Gibbons fares in this challenging environment.",mistral7b,1
"John Houston is a Scottish politician who had been selected to contest the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire during the upcoming general election. However, on Wednesday, he was abruptly suspended from the party after his controversial comments were leaked to two Scottish newspapers. According to reports, Mr Houston's views included calls for the return of the British Empire and suggestions that Scotland should be re-united with England. These statements have sparked outrage among many within the SNP, with one source describing them as 'deeply offensive'.

Mr Houston had only recently joined the SNP, having previously stood for Labour in previous elections. His sudden suspension has left many members feeling shocked and angry, with some questioning how someone with such extreme views could ever have been allowed to join the party. The SNP has not commented specifically on Mr Houston's case but it is understood they take any allegations of racism or bigotry extremely seriously. It is unclear whether Mr Houston will appeal the decision or if he will resign his position entirely.

The incident comes amid growing tensions between the SNP and other political parties, particularly over Brexit negotiations. Many within the party believe that Mr Houston's views are inconsistent with their broader message of inclusivity and equality. Some have suggested that this may have contributed to his suspension, although the party has yet to confirm this publicly.

It is also worth noting that the SNP has faced criticism for its handling of issues related to race and diversity in recent years. In particular, there have been concerns raised by some activists regarding the way certain individuals have been treated by the party leadership. While the SNP has denied these claims, some fear that the suspension of Mr Houston may signal a wider crackdown on dissenting voices.

In any event, the incident is sure to fuel further speculation and debate about the direction of the SNP in the run up to the election. Whether or not the issue ultimately proves significant remains to be seen, but it is clear that Mr Houston's actions have caused a great deal of disquiet amongst those closest to him.",mistral7b,1

Another article about politics, but this one focuses specifically on the upcoming budget speech by Chancellor Gordon Brown. According to recent reports, Brown is set to announce several ambitious goals that the UK will work towards in the coming year. The first of these is a commitment to double aid from donor countries to developing nations around the world. This move is expected to have a significant impact on poverty reduction efforts, as many poor countries rely heavily on outside funding to support their economies and infrastructure projects.
Brown's announcement also includes an effort to eliminate all forms of debt owed by the poorest nations. This goal is seen as particularly important for countries like Zimbabwe and Sudan, which are currently experiencing severe economic crises and struggling to repay loans from Western institutions. By working to erase this debt burden, Britain hopes to help alleviate suffering and promote stability in these troubled regions.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Brown's plans. Some critics argue that the UK should focus more resources on its own economy, rather than spreading itself too thin by trying to assist struggling nations abroad. Others worry that the government may struggle to meet its ambitious targets, given the current state of the global economy. But supporters of Brown say that he has proven himself to be a capable leader who can navigate complex political and financial issues with ease.
As the debate continues over Brown's budget speech and his overall leadership style, one thing is certain: the UK will continue to play an active role on the international stage, whether it be through diplomacy, aid programs, or other initiatives. Whatever challenges come next, it will take a strong, determined leader like Brown to guide the country forward and ensure its continued success.",mistral7b,1

The world's poorest children continue to suffer from preventable deaths due to malnutrition, lack of healthcare, and poor sanitation. According to a recent report by Oxfam, titled ""Paying the Price,"" some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 if current trends continue. This is despite the fact that aid budgets have been cut in half since 1960, which means that resources are not being directed towards where they are needed most.
Oxfam has called on governments, NGOs, and other organizations to take action to address this crisis. In particular, the organization has highlighted the need for increased funding for programs aimed at improving nutrition, access to clean water, and healthcare services for children. Additionally, Oxfam has urged governments to prioritize the needs of these vulnerable populations when negotiating international agreements such as those related to poverty reduction.
As world leaders prepare to gather for the Group of Eight (G8) summit in Northern Ireland, the issue of child mortality remains a major concern. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who will be assuming the role of G8 president, has pledged to work tirelessly to improve living conditions for children around the world. However, critics argue that his efforts may not go far enough given the scale of the problem.
One key area where additional funding is needed is in the realm of maternal health. Each year, more than 300,000 women die during childbirth, many of whom are not receiving adequate care. This is particularly true in developing countries, where there is often a shortage of skilled healthcare providers and facilities. By investing in maternal health programs, it may be possible to reduce the number of deaths caused each year and ultimately save millions of lives over time.
Another important factor to consider is the impact of climate change on global food security. As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more unpredictable, farmers may struggle to grow crops and feed themselves and their families. This could lead to widespread hunger and malnutrition among children, exacerbating existing challenges in this area. To combat this threat, policymakers must take action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and invest in sustainable agricultural practices.
Overall, the challenge facing the world today is complex and multifaceted. While progress has been made in certain areas, such as reducing poverty rates in some parts of Africa, much remains to be done to ensure that all children can live healthy, fulfilling lives. It will require the concerted effort of governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals alike to tackle these issues head-on and make a lasting difference for future generations.",mistral7b,1

The government has been dealt another blow by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the police's use of force during protests outside RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2003 was unlawful.

Thousands of protesters gathered at the base, calling for an end to nuclear weapons testing and demanding that US military planes leave the country. They had appealed against a High Court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn them away, but the Supreme Court disagreed.

Lord Justice Mance said: ""It is clear that this was no ordinary demonstration. These people were determined to stop the exercise of sovereign power by peaceful means. It was not reasonable to treat their conduct as anything other than an offence.""

He added that while the protesters had a right to peaceful assembly, they did not have the right to obstruct the operation of the airbase or to cause damage to property.

The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case, arguing that their actions had been necessary to maintain order. But Lord Justice Mance rejected this argument, saying that there must be limits on what the police can do in the name of maintaining public safety.

The decision will be seen as a victory for civil liberties campaigners and a setback for the government's efforts to restrict protests. It is likely to lead to calls for further reforms to policing powers, including greater scrutiny of the use of force and a stronger role for independent oversight bodies.

However, the government may seek to appeal the decision, which could delay any changes to the law. In any case, it is clear that the issue of protests and police powers remains a contentious one, with strong feelings on both sides.",mistral7b,1

The UK government is considering abolishing the retirement age entirely due to concerns over an aging population, according to former Labour minister Alan Johnson. In his speech at a conference on ageing, Mr. Johnson revealed that the issue of pension reform had been raised during discussions between politicians and civil servants. He stated that the current system was no longer sustainable given the increasing number of people aged over 65 years old and their reliance on state pensions.
According to him, one option being considered by officials is to raise the retirement age gradually until it eventually disappears altogether. This move would help address financial pressures caused by the growing elderly population, as well as reduce dependence on public funds for retirement benefits. However, such changes may face opposition from those who fear they will be forced to continue working later into old age.
In addition to discussing pension reform, the conference also focused on efforts to stamp out ageism and discrimination in the workplace. The government has committed itself to this goal, stating its intention to ban ageist practices and promote greater diversity among employees. This could involve measures such as introducing mandatory age training programs for managers or implementing new laws to protect workers from discriminatory treatment based on age.
Overall, the conference provided insights into the challenges faced by governments today as populations age rapidly across Europe and North America. While there are no easy solutions, policymakers must work together to develop effective strategies that balance economic considerations with social justice concerns. As Mr. Johnson put it, ""It's time we stopped treating the retired as a liability and instead recognized their value as contributors to society.""",mistral7b,1

The UK government has ruled out plans for Las Vegas-style mega casinos to boost local economies in struggling areas, it has been reported. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is said to have written to councils across England and Wales to confirm that such projects will not go ahead, following widespread opposition from campaigners who fear they would harm tourism and property values.

Meanwhile, Labour MP Stephen Pound has criticised the idea of using casinos to drive economic growth, calling them a wasteful investment. He wrote on his website: ""These so-called 'regeneration' schemes are nothing but a bunch of hot air and spin. They don't create jobs, they don't help communities and they don't deliver what they promise.""

Pound also accused the government of being too quick to hand over public money to private developers, without properly assessing the potential impact on local residents. He added: ""We need to focus on real solutions, like investing in our schools, hospitals and infrastructure, rather than throwing good taxpayer money after bad at failed business models like casinos.""

In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles denied any plans for massive casinos to be built in the UK. He said: ""There are no plans to build anything resembling a Las Vegas strip here. We want to see responsible gambling in this country, which means keeping things under control and making sure that these developments benefit local people and their communities.""

However, critics argue that even small-scale casinos can have negative effects on nearby businesses and residential areas. For example, a study by the University of Lancaster found that casinos located near shopping centres had a significant impact on footfall and sales, potentially leading to job losses and reduced income for local traders.",mistral7b,1

1. The ongoing ban on hunting foxes has been met with criticism from animal welfare groups and hunters alike. Many argue that it is an infringement of their rights to hunt for sport, while others say that it is necessary to protect wildlife. Despite this debate, the law remains clear: it is illegal to shoot foxes in England without a valid license.

However, as the law faces a stiff test this weekend with the Countryside Alliance stating that many hunts will be out in full force, questions have arisen over how well enforced the ban truly is. Some fear that the government's efforts to enforce the law are not enough, leading to concerns about the safety of both hunters and non-hunters in rural areas.

Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo has attempted to reassure the public that the law will be strictly enforced, stating that he expects most people to obey the law by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. However, critics argue that these activities still constitute illegal hunting, and could lead to accidents involving innocent individuals.

As the debate rages on, it seems likely that the issue of hunting foxes will remain contentious for years to come. While some may see it as a harmless pastime, others view it as a dangerous activity that poses a threat to wildlife and human life. Ultimately, only time will tell whether the current laws are effective in protecting our countryside from those who wish to use it for sport.",mistral7b,1

Politics: Prime Minister Blair's Egyptian Holiday Sparks Controversy
---------------------------------------------------------------

London - British Prime Minister Tony Blair has come under fire for going on a two-week vacation to Egypt during the height of the Iraq War, which began just days before his departure. Critics argue that the prime minister should have remained in the UK to focus on the crisis and provide updates to the public instead of relaxing on a beach.

In response to these criticisms, the prime minister announced today that he will be taking a break from politics to spend more time with his family. However, this announcement only fueled further speculation about what really happened during his trip and whether or not it was an appropriate use of resources during such a critical period in world history.

One of the most significant aspects of the controversy surrounding Blair's trip is whether or not he was truly ""involved"" in any decision making while he was away. In statements made after his return, Mr Blair claimed that he stayed connected with his advisors and played a key role in shaping government policy even though he wasn't physically present in the country.

However, many people are skeptical of Blair's claims and believe that he simply used his trip as an excuse to escape the pressures of political life. After all, why else would someone go on vacation in the middle of a war? And if Blair was truly so involved in important matters while he was away, why didn't he make himself available to speak to reporters upon his return?

As a result, questions continue to swirl about the nature of Blair's involvement in government affairs during his time off, and whether or not he was fully committed to addressing the pressing issues facing his country. Some politicians are calling for an independent investigation into the matter, while others are demanding that Blair apologize for his actions and assure the public that he will never again take such a frivolous trip during a time of national crisis.

Despite these calls, however, Blair remains defiant in the face of criticism. He insists that his vacation was necessary for maintaining his mental health and wellbeing, and that he has nothing to hide about his activities while he was away. ""I don't think there's anything to say here other than I took a break,"" he said in a statement released earlier today. ""It was my decision to do so, and I stand by it.""

But even those who support the idea of a work-life balance acknowledge that Blair's choice to go on vacation during one of the most intense periods of international conflict in recent history was ill-timed at best. As former US Secretary of State Colin Powell put it, ""If you're the leader of a country, your job is to lead."" By choosing to step back from his responsibilities when they were needed most, Blair may have undermined his credibility and weakened his position as prime minister.

Of course, the debate over Blair's trip is just one part of a much larger conversation about how leaders should handle their personal lives amidst global turmoil. For many people, it raises fundamental questions about what it means to be a leader and whether or not elected officials have a duty to put the needs of the country above their own desires for relaxation and leisure.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether Blair's actions will be seen as a betrayal of trust or a sign of strength in the face of adversity. One thing is certain, however - the ongoing controversy surrounding his trip is likely to haunt him for years to come, casting a long shadow over his legacy as prime minister and raising serious questions about the future of leadership in our increasingly interconnected world.",mistral7b,1

Summary: The 15 year embargo that has been imposed by the United States against Chinese imports due to human rights abuses was eased this week. This move came a day after China announced its plans for democratic reforms and increased transparency. According to sources, the US government is considering lifting all remaining economic sanctions on China, including restrictions on exports to the country and investments here. Meanwhile, European Union leaders have also agreed to lift their economic sanctions on China, citing progress towards democracy and better human rights.

Summary: UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who held talks with Chinese officials in Beijing yesterday, stated that the EU arms code is more effective than the current ban on weapons export to China. According to him, the EU code provides a framework for dialogue between Europe and China on the issue of arms control, while the US ban does nothing but harm the relationship. Straw also expressed his hope that China would take part in international efforts to curb illegal weapons trafficking, which he said is one of the major threats facing the world today.

Summary: In the face of growing criticism from Western powers, China has made limited concessions towards democratic reforms. These include allowing local elections and giving greater autonomy to provinces, but many experts believe that they fall short of what is required for true democracy. The US, in particular, has criticized China for its lack of political freedoms and human rights violations, including the use of torture against dissidents. Meanwhile, the European Union has lifted most of its economic sanctions on China, citing improvements in governance and transparency.

Summary: As China continues to grow at breakneck speed, it is becoming increasingly clear that it will soon surpass the US as the world's biggest economy. According to recent estimates, China is currently on track to grow at an annual rate of 10% or more in the coming years, compared to just 3% for the US. This growth is driven by massive investment in infrastructure projects, such as highways, airports and energy plants, as well as booming manufacturing industries. While this rapid expansion has brought immense benefits to China, including improved living standards and reduced poverty, there are also concerns about sustainability and the impact on other countries in the region.

Jack Straw's Tour Praise for Cooperation in Peace Process

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is currently on a tour through Southeast Asian countries and has expressed his approval for the ""spirit of cooperation"" displayed by all parties involved in achieving the recent breakthrough in the region. His statement comes after media outlets from various nations reported that the agreement reached between two neighboring countries represents a crucial milestone in resolving longstanding conflicts within the area.

During his visit to Thailand, Mr. Straw met with Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiraoja and other government officials to discuss regional issues, including terrorism, economic development, and human rights concerns. The Foreign Secretary also emphasized the importance of maintaining close ties between Britain and its allies in Asia, stating that such relationships are vital for ensuring stability and prosperity throughout the continent.

In addition to meeting with Thai leaders, Mr. Straw attended several events focused on promoting cultural exchange and fostering greater understanding between different communities. He spoke at a conference organized by the British Council, where he highlighted the need for increased dialogue and collaboration among people from diverse backgrounds if they hope to overcome global challenges effectively.

Following his trip to Thailand, Mr. Straw continued his travels to Malaysia, where he received similar praise for his efforts to promote peaceful relations between nations. According to local news sources, the foreign minister's statements were well-received by Malaysian politicians, who expressed gratitude for Britain's support in their country's ongoing struggle against extremist forces.

Meanwhile, media reports in both Thailand and Malaysia describe the recently signed agreement as a significant advancement towards lasting peace in the region. Analysts believe that this deal marks the beginning of a new era of cooperation among neighboring states, which could help pave the way for further progress in addressing common security threats and promoting sustainable development across Southeast Asia.

As part of his tour, Mr. Straw also visited Singapore and Indonesia, where he reiterated his commitment to working closely with local authorities to combat terrorist activities and address other pressing issues facing these countries. Throughout his journey, the Foreign Secretary has stressed the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and building strong partnerships with key players in the region to ensure a brighter future for all those living there.

Overall, Jack Straw's tour has been hailed as an excellent opportunity to strengthen bilateral ties between Britain and Southeast Asian nations while demonstrating support for the region's ongoing peace processes. As he continues to travel throughout the continent, it remains clear that the Foreign Secretary remains deeply committed to promoting stability, prosperity, and cooperation among all peoples and governments in this dynamic and rapidly evolving part of the world.",mistral7b,1

Political leaders have been accused of not doing enough to address the issue of rape during the Rwandan Genocide. The government has faced criticism for failing to provide adequate support and resources to victims of sexual violence. Many survivors say that they still struggle to come to terms with their experiences and receive proper healthcare and counseling. In recent years, there have also been efforts to prosecute those responsible for these crimes.

Despite these challenges, many activists continue to work towards ensuring that justice is served for all those affected by the genocide.",mistral7b,1

1) Boris Johnson has announced that he will be supporting the controversial surveillance bill known as the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA). This decision comes despite concerns from many within the Conservative Party over its potential impact on civil liberties. The Tory leader said his front-bench team had reached a collective agreement after discussing the issue at length. However, he acknowledged that it was not an easy issue to decide upon. Despite this, Mr. Johnson insisted that he believed the legislation would ultimately benefit the country by improving safety and security. In particular, he pointed out that the IPA would allow authorities to track the movements of suspected criminals more closely, making it easier for them to identify potential threats before they can act.
2) Another major political development in recent times is the ongoing debate surrounding Brexit. With the deadline for leaving the European Union fast approaching, many people are becoming increasingly anxious about what the future holds. Some have expressed concern that Britain may not be able to negotiate a deal with the EU before the end of the transition period. Others worry that even if a deal is struck, there could still be significant economic disruption as a result of the UK's departure from the bloc. As such, there continues to be pressure on both sides of the political divide to work towards a resolution that ensures the smooth transfer of power without causing undue distress.
3) Meanwhile, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine remains a highly sensitive issue that continues to dominate headlines around the world. While both parties have accused each other of human rights violations, tensions have been particularly high in recent days following the death of two Palestinian protesters during clashes with Israeli troops. Many have condemned these actions and called for an immediate ceasefire. However, given the deep-rooted historical and cultural differences between the two nations, finding a lasting peace solution may prove challenging. Nevertheless, international leaders continue to urge all parties involved to work together to find a way forward that respects the rights of everyone concerned.
4) Elsewhere, another key topic being discussed in political circles is the proposed merger of two major energy companies, BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Supporters of the move argue that it would create a new global giant in the oil and gas industry, allowing the merged company to better compete against state-owned enterprises in countries like China and Russia. Critics, however, warn that the merger could lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced competition in the market. Given these concerns, regulators in both the US and Europe are likely to closely scrutinize any proposed merger deal to ensure that it does not harm the public interest.
5) Finally, there have also been calls for greater transparency when it comes to government spending, especially in light of the current financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments around the world have spent trillions of dollars trying to keep their economies afloat in recent months, leading some critics to question whether taxpayers' money is being used effectively or efficiently. To address these concerns, many countries have introduced new measures aimed at increasing accountability and promoting greater transparency in how funds are allocated and spent. For example, some governments have set up independent oversight bodies to monitor expenditure and ensure that it aligns with stated priorities and objectives.",mistral7b,1

1. It has been over three years since the signing of the Treaty of Nice, which established the current structure of the European Union (EU). However, this treaty was never ratified by all member states due to concerns raised by countries such as France and Italy. As a result, it was not able to come into effect until recently. Now, with the approval of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the Treaty of Lisbon is set to replace the Treaty of Nice as the foundation document of the EU.
2. One of the main issues that have emerged during the discussions surrounding the new constitution is whether or not the UK should approve the agreement. Many people argue that the UK has always had a strong relationship with the EU and that incorporating the constitution would strengthen their ties even further. Others, however, are concerned that the treaty could lead to greater political integration between member states, something that they believe goes against the principles of national sovereignty and democracy.
3. In order to make an informed decision, many people are turning to the internet for information on the issue. Searches such as ""Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?"" and ""What does the new constitution mean for the UK?"" have become popular in recent weeks. This reflects a growing interest in understanding the implications of the proposed changes and making sure that one's voice is heard in the debate.
4. While the question of whether or not to approve the new constitution remains a matter of debate among politicians and citizens alike, there are already indications that the majority of voters may support it when it comes to the upcoming referendum. According to polls conducted by organizations such as YouGov and Ipsos Mori, more than two-thirds of those surveyed said that they were likely to vote in favor of the treaty.
5. If the treaty is approved by UK voters in the upcoming referendum, it will be incorporated into UK law. This means that the country will become part of the legal framework outlined by the Constitution. This will allow for greater cooperation and coordination between the UK and other member states of the EU, as well as giving them access to a range of benefits such as free movement of goods and services within Europe.
6. Despite these potential advantages, there are still many uncertainties about what the future holds for the UK once it becomes a full member of the EU under the terms of the new Constitution. Some experts predict that the country will face increased competition from other member states in certain areas, while others warn of the risk of losing control over its own affairs.
7. To address these concerns, many groups have called for more transparency and accountability in the process of implementing the new constitution. They argue that the public needs to know exactly how the treaty will affect them, both in terms of their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the EU, as well as the impact it will have on businesses and industries across the country.
8. With only a few months left before the referendum takes place, time is running out for those who want to make their voices heard on the issue of the new constitution. Whether you agree or disagree with the proposal, it is important to educate yourself about the facts and consider your options carefully before casting your vote.
9. Ultimately, the fate of the new constitution will depend on the decisions made by voters in each individual member state. But whatever the outcome, one thing is clear - the debate surrounding the creation of a single European legal framework is far from over, and will continue to shape the political landscape of the continent for years to come.",mistral7b,1

Title: Attack on MP Quentin Davies Leaves Him Unharmed in Nairobi Park

MP Quentin Davies was involved in an incident that has left him shaken after being mugged in a notorious park in Nairobi while visiting Kenya last weekend. Despite the attack, he emerged unscathed and is currently recovering from the traumatic experience.

Davies had been attending a charity event at a nearby hotel before deciding to visit one of the city's famous parks. However, it seems his decision proved fatal as he became the target of thieves who were waiting to prey on unsuspecting visitors. According to eyewitnesses, the attackers approached Davies, demanded money and valuables, and threatened to use violence if their demands were refused.

Despite this, Davies managed to fend off the attackers, using his quick thinking and self-defense skills to escape harm. Although he sustained minor injuries during the altercation, he was able to call for help and eventually leave the scene safely.

""I am deeply saddened by this incident and grateful that Mr. Davies escaped injury,"" said a spokesperson for the British Embassy in Nairobi. ""We urge all travelers to exercise caution when visiting public spaces in Kenya and take steps to protect themselves against potential threats such as pickpocketing or robbery.""

Davies, who represents the Grantham and Stamford constituency, was elected to parliament in 1997 and has since become known for his work promoting social justice issues and advocating for human rights. It remains unclear what impact this recent incident will have on his political career, but his colleagues are expressing support for his recovery.",mistral7b,1

Nicholas Betts-Green, who had been selected to fight the Suffolk Coastal seat for the Conservative Party, resigned his candidacy just days before the general election. The resignation came after reports surfaced in a local newspaper that Mr. Green had attended a British National Party (BNP) meeting last month.

In an interview with the paper, Mr. Green admitted attending the meeting, but said that it was the only time he had come into contact with the far-right party. He stated that he did not hold any affiliations or sympathies with the group and was disappointed that his presence at the event was being used against him.

Mr. Green's departure from the race is likely to leave the Conservatives struggling to maintain their grip on the coastal seat they have held since 1983. With no clear frontrunner emerging yet, Labour has indicated that it will be targeting the seat as part of its wider efforts to win back lost territory from the Tories in the south east of England.

The resignation comes amid growing scrutiny of extremist groups and their activities ahead of the general election. In recent weeks, there have been reports of members of other far-right organisations holding rallies and events across the country. Some experts fear that this could lead to increased radicalisation and violence if left unchecked.",mistral7b,1

Politics is a field where decisions are made and policies are created that affect millions of people. It involves different branches, including national defense, foreign policy, healthcare, education, and more. One issue that has recently caught the attention of governments worldwide is nuclear waste management.

The United Kingdom government has announced plans for storing intermediate level waste that was previously intended to be returned to its home countries. This decision comes after a long debate between countries regarding the responsibility of managing their own nuclear waste. Some countries argue that it should remain in their possession, while others believe it would be better managed in other countries with expertise in nuclear waste management. However, due to various reasons such as logistics challenges and safety concerns, this plan may not work out as expected.

In response to this challenge, the government has decided to store the ILW in the UK until it can find a permanent solution. According to officials, the move will help protect public health and ensure the safe disposal of radioactive materials. Additionally, the funds generated from the sale of this waste will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme, which aims to address the legacy issues left behind by the country's nuclear power industry.

This announcement is likely to cause controversy among affected countries and raise questions about international cooperation on nuclear waste management. Critics argue that it sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to further tensions over the handling of radioactive materials. On the other hand, proponents of the measure argue that it is necessary given the risks associated with transporting highly hazardous waste across borders.

Overall, the decision by the UK government represents a significant shift in approach to nuclear waste management. While there are certainly challenges ahead, it remains to be seen whether this new strategy will succeed in addressing one of the most pressing environmental problems facing our world today.",mistral7b,1

Tony Blair has been working closely with Israel and Palestine leaders to find a lasting peace agreement for the region. The British Prime Minister met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to move forward with the stalled Middle East Peace Process. Mr Blair's discussions with the two leaders focused on reforming the Palestinian Authority and addressing security concerns, as these are seen as key obstacles to achieving a lasting peace deal.

During their meeting in Downing Street, Mr Blair confirmed that a London conference would be held in March to discuss the future of the region. This conference will bring together representatives from all sides to work towards finding a comprehensive solution to the conflict. According to sources close to the meeting, both Sharon and Abbas expressed a willingness to participate in such talks and to make concessions in order to achieve peace. However, there is still much work to be done before a final agreement can be reached.

The UK government has played a crucial role in the Middle East Peace Process since its inception, and Mr Blair's efforts to revive it are being widely praised by international leaders. Many believe that a successful outcome to the talks could have far-reaching implications not just for the region but also for the wider global community. In particular, the US and EU have expressed support for Mr Blair's efforts and have pledged to provide financial assistance to any agreements that emerge from the conference.

However, the road ahead remains difficult. There are deep divisions within each side of the conflict, and many groups remain opposed to any kind of compromise. Additionally, the violence and instability in the region continue to pose a significant threat to progress. Despite these challenges, Mr Blair and other world leaders remain committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict and ensuring that all parties involved benefit from a stable and prosperous region.

As preparations for the London conference begin, Mr Blair is working tirelessly behind the scenes to bring together the various factions and ensure that everyone feels heard. His hope is that through open dialogue and constructive negotiations, they can reach a comprehensive agreement that addresses the needs of all parties involved. While no one knows what the future holds, Mr Blair's determination to see this process through and find a solution is inspiring to millions around the world who are watching closely.",mistral7b,1

Title: Political Leaders Abducted and Expelled

Date: November 4th, 2023

Two prominent political figures have faced significant challenges this week, one being held captive while the other has been removed from their political affiliation. Mrs Hassan, a respected humanitarian leader who had been working with Care International in Iraq since 2017, was kidnapped by unknown assailants on October 19th. The details surrounding her disappearance remain limited as authorities continue to investigate the incident.

On a completely different note, Mr Galloway, former Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow North East, found himself without a political home after the Labor Party expelled him over his vocal opposition to the ongoing conflict in Syria. His stance on the issue, which he expressed publicly during several speeches and interviews, proved to be too contentious within the party leadership, leading to his removal. In response, Galloway stated that he would not seek re-election under any circumstances but vowed to continue advocating for peace through nonviolent means.",mistral7b,1

Title: Allegations of Al-Qaeda Links Lead to Detention of Four Men

In a shocking revelation, four men have been detained by authorities for allegedly having ties to al-Qaeda. Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi, and Richard Belmar are being held for three years, according to sources close to the matter.

The arrests sparked outrage among civil rights groups who argue that there is no evidence linking these individuals to terrorist activities. However, law enforcement officials maintain that the men are being investigated on suspicion of supporting extremist groups.

Mr. Begg's father, Azmat, spoke out against the detention, saying he had been told that he could see his son for just 20 minutes at a time. He described his son as a ""hero,"" adding that he was proud of all that he had accomplished during his time in prison.

Despite their families' pleas for them to be released, it remains unclear what charges they may face or when they will next appear before the court. Many worry that the government's crackdown on terrorism is leading to increased surveillance and repression of free speech and dissent.

Critics of the government's actions argue that the detention of innocent people without due process of law only serves to further alienate already marginalized communities. They call for greater transparency and accountability in the justice system, as well as an end to policies that target Muslims solely based on their religious beliefs.

Supporters of the government, however, insist that the measures taken to combat terrorism are necessary to protect national security. They point to recent attacks carried out by extremist organizations as proof of the need to remain vigilant.

As tensions continue to rise between supporters and opponents of the government's policies, many fear that the situation may escalate into full-blown conflict. The detention of innocent men like Begg, Mubanga, Abbasi, and Belmar highlights the dangers of political polarization and the erosion of individual liberties.",mistral7b,1

Rural Affairs Minister George Eustace has stated that he will be cracking down on illegal hunting after a new law came into effect on Friday. The law aims to reduce the number of illegally killed animals, particularly foxes, during hunt meets. According to Mr Eustace, there is zero tolerance for those who flout the law and pretend to follow it. He added that it would become evident if people did so and they would face severe consequences.

On Saturday, over 270 hunt meets met legally, killing a total of 91 foxes. However, only four accidents occurred during these meetings, resulting in the death of one badger, two birds of prey, and an unmarked dog. This shows that most hunters are following the rules and regulations set out in the new law.

Mr Eustace also expressed his satisfaction with the initial success of the new law. He stated that it was crucial to protect wildlife from the cruelty inflicted by illegal hunters. He added that he hoped that this law would serve as a deterrent for anyone thinking of engaging in such activities.

However, opponents have criticized the new law for its impact on traditional sport. They argue that the restrictions imposed could lead to the closure of many hunt clubs. In response, Mr Eustace emphasized that the law does not target all hunting activities but rather focuses on reducing the number of illegally killed animals.

Despite criticism, the government remains committed to protecting wildlife and ensuring that everyone follows the rules. The rural affairs minister urged those involved in hunting to respect the new laws and work together towards a common goal of preserving our natural heritage.",mistral7b,1

Home Secretary Charles Clarke today announced plans to overhaul Britain's immigration policy by introducing a point-based system for economic migrants and increasing the number of failed asylum seekers that will be sent back to their countries. The new measures aim to curb abuse of the current immigration system and reduce illegal immigration.

Clarke told MPs that his proposals would create a fairer and more efficient immigration system, allowing legitimate workers from abroad to come to work in the UK without having to compete unfairly with British citizens. He also promised to take tough action on those who try to enter the country illegally or abuse the system.

Tony Blair has been quick to endorse Clarke's plan, saying that it was necessary to address the growing concerns over immigration and its impact on society. However, he also cautioned against expecting too much from this measure, stating that there was no ""magic bullet"" solution to the problem.

The Home Office is currently working on implementing these changes, which will involve setting up a database of skilled workers and creating a scoring system based on various factors such as qualifications, experience, and language proficiency. This system will allow employers to apply for visas for workers they want to hire, while applicants will need to meet certain criteria before being granted entry to the UK.

In addition, Clarke wants to increase the number of failed asylum seekers that will be deported from the UK. Currently, only one in four failed asylum seekers is removed from the country, while many others remain free to claim benefits and live here legally. Clarke believes that this is not fair to taxpayers and to other legal immigrants who have gone through the proper channels to gain permission to work in the UK.

However, critics argue that this approach could lead to increased discrimination against ethnic minorities, especially if the criteria used to assess eligibility for entry into the UK become too strict. They also fear that sending large numbers of failed asylum seekers back to their home countries may cause political instability in those countries.

Blair acknowledges these concerns and has called for a review of the immigration system after the general election. But he insists that something must be done to tackle the problems caused by uncontrolled migration and ensure that legitimate workers can find jobs without facing undue competition from overseas.",mistral7b,1

London Mayor Boris Johnson has condemned Labour leader Ed Miliband for failing to take action against Ken Livingstone over the politician's controversial remarks. In an interview yesterday, Johnson called Livingstone's behaviour ""totally unacceptable"" and demanded that Miliband distance himself from the former London mayor. However, Miliband defended the decision to allow Livingstone back into the party, stating that it was necessary to give him the opportunity to make amends for his past mistakes.

Johnson also criticised the way in which Livingstone has been allowed to return to the Labour fold without facing any real consequences for his actions. He argued that if anyone else made similar comments they would be ostracized from their political party. This double standard has only served to undermine the credibility of the Labour Party and tarnish its reputation as a progressive force for good.

Despite calls for Livingstone to apologize for his comments, he has remained resolute in his stance, claiming that he stands by them. During his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Livingstone reiterated his belief that there is no apology needed, arguing that his statements are not racially charged. The Evening Standard reporter in question, who asked Livingstone why he felt compelled to use such language, was left feeling intimidated and harassed by the ex-mayor.

The controversy surrounding Livingstone's remarks has sparked heated debates among politicians and members of the public alike. Some have praised Livingstone's refusal to back down, while others have condemned his lack of remorse. It remains to be seen how this will all play out in the coming weeks, but one thing is clear - the debate over Livingstone's comments will continue long after this particular incident has died down.

Meanwhile, Johnson continues to push for greater transparency and accountability in the political process. Yesterday he announced plans to introduce new regulations on lobbying groups and donations, in a bid to crackdown on corruption and influence-peddling. These proposals have received broad support from both Labour and Conservative MPs, who agree that it is crucial to ensure that political power is vested in those who serve the interests of the people rather than those who seek to profit off them.

While Johnson may not always see eye-to-eye with his opponents, one thing he can certainly count on is the support of many voters in London. His popularity remains strong, with polls showing that he enjoys the backing of nearly three quarters of the city. Despite challenges from other parties, including UKIP, Johnson has proven time and again that he is the man to lead London forward into the future.",mistral7b,1

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced criticism from MPs over his handling of Brexit after he gave an interview on the eve of a crucial vote. He spoke to the BBC's Newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the Pakistani community in Manchester. During the interview, Mr Johnson defended his plans for post-Brexit trade and immigration policy but was grilled by presenter Emily Maitlis over concerns that his approach could harm vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbin accused Mr Johnson of trying to distract voters with a visit to a local mosque. The PM has been under pressure from both sides of the political divide as the country prepares for a potentially contentious vote on whether to leave the European Union without a deal.

In other political developments, US President Donald Trump held talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at their second summit in Vietnam. The meeting focused on denuclearisation efforts on the Korean peninsula and saw progress made towards peace negotiations. However, experts have warned that any agreement reached between the two leaders will be difficult to implement due to ongoing tensions and differences in ideology. In Europe, France held national elections with Emmanuel Macron winning another term as president. The election result was seen as a victory for the centre-left candidate who campaigned on progressive policies including climate change, social justice and economic growth. Elsewhere, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his reelection bid for 2018. He won the polls with ease, extending his rule for another six years.

Meanwhile, former UK prime minister Tony Blair came under fire again as new evidence emerged regarding his role in Iraq's invasion. According to documents published online, Mr Blair received legal advice warning that invading Iraq would breach international law if there were no weapons of mass destruction found. Despite this, the PM went ahead with the war, which led to thousands of deaths and displacement of people across the region. Protesters gathered outside Parliament to demand an apology from Mr Blair and hold him accountable for his actions during the conflict.

Back home, British politicians continue to debate the implications of Brexit on various aspects of life. One major concern is how the departure from the EU will affect the economy, particularly in terms of trade deals and access to foreign labour. Many businesses are already facing uncertainty due to the lack of clarity on future arrangements, leading to delays and cost increases. There are also fears that a hard or no-deal Brexit could lead to increased immigration pressures, putting strain on public services such as healthcare and education.

Amid all these developments, it seems clear that the global political landscape remains complex and uncertain. From Brexit to nuclear proliferation, conflicts in Syria and beyond, there are many challenges facing leaders today. As we move into a new year, only time will tell what the future holds and whether nations can find common ground amidst their differences.",mistral7b,1

Politics is full of controversies, and one such controversy that has been making headlines recently is the scandal involving former home secretary David Blunkett. The incident took place several years ago when Sir John Grieve was the permanent secretary at the Home Office. At the time, the scandal involved the fast-tracking of a visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny, who had come from Jamaica. This led to widespread criticism and calls for an investigation into the matter.

The controversy began when it was revealed that Mr Blunkett had written personal letters to Sir John Gieve on behalf of his ex-lover's nanny, urging him to speed up her application process. It was later discovered that Sir John Gieve had not kept proper records of these letters and had failed to remember any details of the case. This led to further allegations that he had covered up the affair and tried to protect himself from scrutiny.

As the scandal unfolded, many politicians called for an independent review of the circumstances surrounding the fast-tracking of the visa. However, this was met with resistance from both the government and Sir John Gieve. They argued that the decision had been made in good faith and that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Despite their efforts, however, public opinion remained firmly against them, and they faced growing pressure to provide more information about the case.

Eventually, after months of investigations and protests, Mr Blunkett resigned as home secretary over the scandal. Sir John Gieve also faced disciplinary action, although it remains unclear whether he will face serious consequences. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in government, particularly in high-ranking positions like those held by Sir John Gieve.

In conclusion, the scandal involving Mr Blunkett and Sir John Gieve is just one example of the many controversies that plague politics today. While the outcome of this particular story may have been controversial, it serves as a cautionary tale for those in power: that even seemingly small decisions can have far-reaching consequences, and that it is important to act with integrity and honesty at all times.",mistral7b,1

UKIP Member Attacked With Slurry During BBC Radio Show

In what can only be described as an unprecedented incident, a UK Independence Party (UKIP) member was attacked with slurry while on his way to a BBC radio show. The victim, who has not been named at this time, is believed to have been targeted while walking down a street near the studio. It is unclear what the motive behind the attack was.

Fellow Guest Hit By Slurry

Ruth Kelly MP, who was also scheduled to appear on the same BBC radio show, was also hit by the slurry during the attack. She suffered minor injuries but was able to continue with her appearance on the program.

Police Investigating Incident

London Metropolitan Police are currently investigating the incident and have appealed for witnesses to come forward. Detectives are particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have seen the suspect or witnessed any suspicious activity in the area prior to the attack.

UKIP Statement

The UK Independence Party issued a statement condemning the attack and expressing sympathy for its member. They called on the police to bring the perpetrator to justice and ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

""We deplore this act of violence against one of our members,"" said Nigel Farage, the party leader. ""This type of behavior will not be tolerated and we urge the authorities to take swift action.""

Public Outrage

The attack has sparked outrage among many people, including those within the UKIP. Many have expressed their shock and disbelief that someone would resort to such tactics to target political figures. Some have even suggested that the incident could lead to a rise in hate crimes against politicians.

""It's appalling that someone would stoop so low as to commit such a violent crime against a public figure,"" said Jane Smith, a UKIP activist. ""We need stronger measures in place to prevent these types of attacks from happening again.""

BBC Statement

The BBC has released a statement saying that they are deeply sorry that one of their guests was involved in the incident. They added that they take all safety concerns seriously and work closely with local authorities to ensure that their facilities are secure.

""Our thoughts are with those affected by this incident,"" said a spokesperson for the BBC. ""We want to assure everyone that we are taking all necessary steps to ensure that similar events never occur again.""

Conclusion

The attack on the UKIP member and fellow guest Ruth Kelly MP is a disturbing development and highlights the dangers faced by politicians today. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen what the motive behind the attack was and whether there were any underlying issues that led to the violence. However, whatever the cause, it is clear that such acts of violence cannot be tolerated and must be addressed immediately if we are to maintain a safe and peaceful society.",mistral7b,1

Title: Ian Macdonald QC resigns from Legal Aid after Government ignores House of Lords ruling on detention of terror suspects

Date: March 23, 2018

Source: The Guardian

Ian Macdonald QC has resigned from legal aid work after the UK government ignored a House of Lords ruling that the practice of indefinite detention of terror suspects is unlawful. Macdonald, one of Britain's most respected and experienced lawyers, had been representing several high-profile clients under the Special Advocate Scheme (SAS), which allows him to provide legal representation to individuals accused of terrorist crimes while maintaining their right to secrecy and confidentiality.

The House of Lords ruled earlier this year that the use of detention without charge or trial for up to six months constitutes a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the government refused to accept the ruling and continued to defend its policy of indefinite detention of terror suspects, arguing that such measures are necessary for national security purposes.

Macdonald, along with other SAS lawyers, had been advocating for the release of their clients and challenging the legality of the detentions under British law. But his efforts were met with resistance, as he faced numerous obstacles and restrictions imposed by the government and intelligence agencies.

""Ian Macdonald QC has always believed deeply in the rule of law, human rights and due process,"" said Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen. ""It is disheartening that the UK government continues to ignore these fundamental principles in the name of counterterrorism.""

Macdonald's departure from legal aid work comes at a time when tensions between legal professionals and the government are at an all-time high over issues related to immigration, asylum, and civil liberties. Many legal organizations, including the Law Society and Bar Standards Board, have expressed concern about the erosion of legal protections and the undermining of independent judicial decision-making in the UK.

In recent years, Macdonald has also become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the UK government's foreign policies, particularly regarding the war on terror and its impact on civilians in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. In a 2017 speech, he argued that the UK's involvement in these conflicts has contributed to the rise of extremist groups and the displacement of millions of people, creating a vicious cycle of violence and instability.

As Macdonald steps down from his role as a special advocate, he plans to continue advocating for social justice and human rights through his own private practice and pro bono work. He also intends to remain active in public discourse and commentary, using his expertise and experience to challenge the power structures and injustices that he believes are undermining the values upon which modern democracies are founded.",mistral7b,1

1) In his final speech as Prime Minister, Tony Blair hailed the agreement reached by EU leaders to grant Turkey membership to the bloc. The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were ""wrong"", Mr Blair said. He added that it represented the achievement of an ""historic British objective"".

2) As the dust settles on the UK's Brexit negotiations, politicians have been quick to praise the landmark agreement reached by Theresa May and her team. The deal, which includes measures to protect workers' rights and ensure access to healthcare for expats living abroad, has been widely praised for its clarity and detail.

3) After months of heated debate over immigration policy, the government has finally released details of their plans for managing migration after Brexit. While some have welcomed the move as long-awaited clarification, others fear that the restrictions will be too harsh and damage the economy.

4) In a major diplomatic breakthrough, world leaders came together to negotiate a historic peace deal in Syria. The agreement, brokered by Russia and Iran, marks the first time that all parties involved in the conflict have agreed to work towards a resolution.

5) With tensions rising between North Korea and the United States, there are growing concerns that war could break out at any moment.

The government has been criticized for its treatment of workers who speak out against safety hazards at work. It was revealed that 1,500 ""safety whistleblower"" have lost their jobs between 1999 and now. This comes as a concern for trade unions and labor rights activists who are calling on the government to take action.

Some firms were accused of being more interested in profitability than the welfare of their employees. In many cases, these companies found it cheaper to fire a worker than to make changes to the building or adjust working conditions. The report also highlighted the lack of support provided by the government for those who lose their jobs as a result of blowing the whistle.

Labor leaders called on the government to introduce new laws to protect workers' rights to speak out about safety concerns. They also urged employers to take responsibility for creating safe environments for their workers. Many people are concerned about the potential health risks posed by unsafe working conditions, especially given recent incidents such as the Grenfell tower fire and the ongoing construction industry scandals.

There is currently no official response from the government on this issue, but there are calls for a review of current legislation regarding workplace safety and whistleblowing. Some experts argue that the law needs to be updated to reflect modern-day working practices and provide greater protection for workers. Others suggest that more resources need to be allocated towards enforcing existing regulations.

Despite these challenges, labor leaders remain committed to fighting for better workers' rights and ensuring a safer workplace for everyone. They believe that every employee should feel free to speak up about safety issues without fear of retaliation. Only through collective action can real progress be made in improving workplace safety and protecting the rights of workers.",mistral7b,1

Politicians often face tough questioning when appearing on TV shows like BBC's Breakfast with Frost. During a recent interview with former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, host David Frost pressed him on an old comment he had made about British politicians being corrupt. According to Frost, Kinnock had called members of Parliament ""brigands, muggers, bribers and gangsters"" in the past. However, Kinnock argued that his remarks were taken out of context and should not be used against him today. He explained that at the time, he was criticizing the way in which some politicians were behaving and how they were treating the public. Despite this, Kinnock acknowledged that his choice of words may have been too strong and that he regretted making them. The debate over whether or not Kinnock's comment was fair continued throughout the show, with many viewers taking sides based on their political beliefs. Ultimately, however, it seemed that the main takeaway from the interview was that even after so many years, Kinnock was still willing to admit when he had done wrong and apologize for it. This could serve as an example to other politicians who may face similar scrutiny in the future.",mistral7b,1

The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has called for reform of the late night licensing laws, saying that the current system is not effective at tackling problematic landlords. This comes after a controversial plan was proposed to extend the opening hours of pubs and other licensed premises.

Chris Fox, the ACPO president, spoke out against the current 24-hour closure power, which he believes does not go far enough in addressing the issue of bad landlords. ""We need stronger measures than what we currently have,"" said Mr Fox. ""The current system simply does not have enough teeth to tackle the problems we are facing.""

His comments come amidst growing concern over the rise of antisocial behavior in cities across the country. Many people believe that allowing bars and pubs to stay open all day will only exacerbate this problem.

Despite this, there are those who support the proposal. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), for example, argues that extending the closing times would provide more opportunities for people to socialize and could help reduce crime rates by providing more places for people to spend their nights.

However, opponents of the plan argue that it could lead to increased traffic congestion and noise pollution. They also fear that it could put additional strain on local resources such as hospitals and police stations.

As debate continues over the merits of the plan, it remains to be seen whether or not it will ever become law. But one thing is clear: the issue of late night licensing is likely to remain a contentious topic for many years to come.",mistral7b,1

Home Secretary David Blunkett has been under fire for the past few weeks over allegations that he had an affair with his former nanny, Kimberley Quinn. While Blunkett initially denied any wrongdoing, he later admitted that he did have an emotional affair with Quinn during their time together at university.

Blunkett has since faced criticism from both politicians and members of the public who are questioning whether such behavior should be acceptable for someone in a position of power and authority like him. The home secretary, however, has defended himself by saying that he believes everyone should take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of their social status or profession.

In an interview with the Guardian earlier this week, Blunkett described how the scandal had affected his family and personal life. He explained that while he had always been very open and honest with his children about their mother's decision to leave him when they were young, the recent revelation of his relationship with Quinn had caused them even more distress.

""It's not easy for anyone involved,"" Blunkett said. ""My children are upset and I can understand why. It affects everything we do as a family. But you have to accept these things happen and move on. That doesn't mean you forget what happened or try to make excuses for yourself. You just have to face up to it and work through it.""

Despite facing widespread criticism, Blunkett has also received support from many quarters. Some politicians, including Labour leader Tony Blair, have come out in defense of the home secretary, praising his commitment to his job and his ability to put aside personal differences in order to get things done.

However, others have criticized Blunkett's handling of the situation, arguing that he could have been more forthcoming about his relationship with Quinn sooner rather than waiting until it became public knowledge. In particular, there has been criticism of Blunkett's attempts to keep his affair hidden from Mrs Quinn herself.

According to reports, Blunkett is now planning to sue Mrs Quinn's ex-husband, Kevin Keenan, in an attempt to obtain access to her son so that he can continue seeing his grandchildren. However, critics have accused Blunkett of using his position of power and influence to further his own interests, rather than putting the welfare of the child first.

Overall, it remains to be seen how Blunkett will emerge from this crisis. While he has maintained that he takes full responsibility for his actions, the damage done to his reputation and his relationship with his children may be irreparable. Only time will tell how the story unfolds and whether the home secretary will manage to salvage his career and personal life in the process.",mistral7b,1

1. In a scathing report, the Environmental Audit Committee accused the government of promoting sustainable communities without any proper definition or understanding of the term. According to the committee, many policies aimed at creating eco-friendly neighborhoods fail to address key issues such as energy requirements and transportation. The committee called for greater scrutiny of these initiatives to ensure they truly are beneficial to the environment.
2. As concerns over climate change continue to rise, the need for sustainable living solutions becomes increasingly urgent. However, according to a recent study by the World Bank, many countries lack the political will and infrastructure needed to implement effective green policies. Without strong leadership from governments, it may be difficult to make progress towards a more sustainable future.
3. One of the biggest challenges facing politicians today is how to balance economic growth with environmental protection. While there is no denying that we need to create new jobs and stimulate economic development, we must also find ways to reduce our carbon footprint and protect natural resources for future generations. This requires a delicate balancing act between short-term interests and long-term sustainability goals.
4. Another major issue facing politicians is how to address social inequality while still maintaining economic stability. Many people feel left behind by globalization and technological advances, and this has led to increased polarization and political instability. To tackle this challenge, policymakers must work together to create inclusive societies where everyone can benefit from economic prosperity.
5. Finally, the increasing influence of technology on politics cannot be ignored. From artificial intelligence to data analytics, technology is changing the way we govern and interact with each other. Politicians must stay up to date with these developments and adapt their strategies accordingly if they want to remain relevant and responsive to citizens' needs.
6. Overall, politics remains a complex and challenging field, filled with competing priorities and limited resources. However, by working together and prioritizing long-term sustainability goals, we can create a better future for ourselves and our planet.",mistral7b,1

Title: MPs Call For Tougher Sentences Under Influence Of Drink Or Drugs Amidst Rising Crime Rate

As crime rates rise across the country, members of parliament are calling for harsher penalties for offenders who commit crimes while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The influential Commons Home Affairs Committee responded to new sentencing guidelines that were introduced earlier this year by urging judges to take a more stringent approach when dealing with such cases.

The committee argued that current laws do not provide enough protection to victims and their families. They pointed out that criminals who have been convicted of violent acts under the influence of drugs often receive lenient sentences, which they argue is unfair and fails to reflect the severity of these offenses.

""We believe that there is too much tolerance towards those who use illegal substances,"" said one of the committee members. ""It's time that we took responsibility and acted to protect our communities from the scourge of drug-related violence.""

The Home Office has already taken steps to address the issue, introducing new measures aimed at tackling drug abuse and reducing its impact on society. But according to some experts, more needs to be done to stem the tide of criminal activity that is linked to drug use.

""Drug addiction is a serious problem and it requires urgent attention from policymakers and law enforcement agencies alike,"" said one expert. ""We need to invest more resources into rehabilitation programs and support services for those who are struggling with addiction.""

The government has acknowledged the need for change and has pledged to work closely with local authorities and community organizations to combat drug-related crime. However, critics argue that the government should go further and decriminalize drug possession for personal use altogether.

Supporters of decriminalization say that this would remove the stigma associated with drug use and allow people to seek help without fear of prosecution. They argue that by treating addiction as a medical issue rather than a criminal matter, we can reduce the number of young people being drawn into the criminal justice system and improve public health outcomes.

Opponents of decriminalization argue that it will encourage people to experiment with drugs and undermine efforts to tackle organized crime. They point to evidence from countries such as Portugal, where drug decriminalization has led to an increase in the use of drugs, including cocaine and heroin.

Despite ongoing debates over drug policy, there is no doubt that addressing the root causes of crime and supporting vulnerable individuals is essential if we want to create safer and more just societies. As politicians continue to grapple with rising crime rates and calls for reform, it remains to be seen what action will ultimately be taken and whether it will prove effective in combating the complex issues that drive criminal behavior.",mistral7b,1

Title: MPs Call for Clarification on Hunting Law After Devon Farmer's Case

Subtitle: The controversial case of a Devon farmer who used his dogs to chase away animals has sparked calls for clarification on hunting laws from local MPs.

Body: A recent incident involving a Devon farmer and the use of dogs for pest control purposes has raised questions about the legality of hunting activities under current UK law. According to reports, the farmer, based in North Devon, had been advised by an animal welfare expert that using his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his land would be legal as long as he did not intend to harm or kill them. However, this advice contradicts existing hunting regulations which state that all forms of wildlife must be killed when pursued by dogs.

As a result of this confusion, local MPs have called on the government to provide clarity on hunting laws and their application to different types of pest control methods. In particular, they are concerned about the impact this ambiguity may have on farmers who rely on dogs for the management of their land, as well as on the wider public interest in protecting endangered species. Some MPs argue that there is already enough evidence to suggest that hunting practices should be restricted or banned altogether due to the significant threat posed to wildlife populations.

This latest controversy comes at a time when tensions between hunters and conservationists remain high in many parts of the United Kingdom. Last year saw the introduction of new legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal hunting and poaching activities, but these efforts have faced criticism from those who believe that legitimate hunters are unfairly being targeted. Supporters of hunting argue that it provides a vital source of income and employment in rural areas, while opponents point out that the practice causes unnecessary suffering to animals and undermines efforts to protect biodiversity.

In light of these ongoing debates, many people are calling for greater transparency and consistency in enforcing and interpreting UK hunting laws. This includes the establishment of clear guidelines for farmers and other landowners regarding acceptable forms of pest control and stricter penalties for individuals found guilty of engaging in illegal hunting activities. While no one denies the right to manage private property and protect one's assets, it is essential that we strike a balance between economic development and environmental sustainability, especially given the critical role played by healthy ecosystems in supporting human life and wellbeing.",mistral7b,1

Political leaders across the UK have been criticised for their handling of the healthcare crisis as wait times for routine surgeries continue to soar. Herefordshire County Hospital had earlier announced plans to take patients who are currently on waiting lists for hip and knee operations off those lists if they are forced to wait longer than expected due to staff shortages or other issues. The hospital's move was welcomed by many, but others have called it a desperate measure rather than a solution to the problem.

GPs in Wales have also raised concerns over long wait times for routine procedures. With many hospitals struggling under the pressure of increasing patient numbers, there is fear that patients may not receive the care they need when they need it. This has led to calls for more funding to hire additional staff and improve facilities to ensure that everyone can access the care they need.

The government has faced criticism from both opposition parties and medical professionals for its failure to address the healthcare crisis adequately. Many have accused the government of cutting too much money from the NHS budget and failing to invest enough in hiring new staff and upgrading equipment. Others have argued that there needs to be greater investment in preventative measures such as health education and public health initiatives to reduce the demand for routine procedures.

As the debate continues over how best to tackle the healthcare crisis, one thing is certain: patients are suffering. Wait times for routine surgery are already lengthy, and with the ongoing pandemic, these delays are only set to worsen. There are fears that many people will be left without access to the care they need, leading to increased pain, discomfort, and even death. It is up to political leaders to take action now before things get any worse.

Despite the challenges facing the NHS, there are still reasons to hope. Hospitals across the UK are continuing to work tirelessly to provide the care their patients need, despite being stretched to their limits. Medical professionals are going above and beyond to make sure that every patient receives the attention and support they deserve. And while the government may have failed to address the crisis adequately in the past, there is always the chance to do better in the future.",mistral7b,1

1) The headteacher of a prominent independent faith school has hit back at criticism from Ofsted bosses after being accused of failing to promote British values. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Bell criticised the school's approach to religion, stating that it was too focused on promoting the beliefs of its own community rather than those of wider British society. This sparked outrage among parents and pupils who are fiercely proud of their school's traditions. However, they argue that religious education is essential to their identity and cultural heritage.
2) The debate over independent faith schools continues as Ofsted chiefs come under fire for their comments about these institutions. Many people have questioned whether the watchdog is capable of accurately assessing the performance of these schools, given the subjectivity involved when evaluating religious education. Some have also raised concerns about the government's decision to allow more faith-based academies to open, arguing that this could lead to even greater division between different communities. As the controversy rages on, it remains unclear what the future holds for these schools.
3) The controversy surrounding independent faith schools took another turn today as Mr Bell issued a clarification of his earlier statements. He admitted that he had been misinterpreted, and that he did not mean to suggest that these schools were inherently intolerant of other religions or belief systems. Instead, he emphasised the importance of tolerance and respect within all faith communities. His statement came after several high-profile figures spoke out against his original remarks, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.
4) Despite the controversy surrounding them, many independent faith schools remain popular among families looking to provide their children with a unique educational experience. These schools often offer small class sizes, individual attention, and a focus on character development and spirituality. Parents say that this allows their children to flourish both academically and emotionally, while maintaining their faith and cultural heritage. However, critics argue that this narrow focus can stifle creativity and critical thinking, leading to a lack of diversity in thought and perspective.
5) It seems likely that the debate over independent faith schools will continue well into the future, as different parties seek to assert their ideals and priorities. While some may see these schools as an important part of Britain's diverse education system, others view them as a threat to national unity and progress. Whatever side of the argument one takes, there is no denying that these schools play an important role in shaping the next generation of leaders and citizens.",mistral7b,1

The Scottish Government has been accused of failing to provide adequate support for people suffering from eczema while in prison. This was highlighted by a recent case involving armed robber Robert Napier, who won £2,450 in damages after claiming he developed eczema due to poor conditions at Barlinnie Prison.

Napier had spent several months in a cell without proper medical attention, and the lack of care led him to develop severe symptoms of eczema on his hands and feet. The court heard that Napier had tried numerous times to raise concerns about his condition with prison staff but was ignored.

This case highlights the need for greater awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by those with chronic health conditions in prisons. Eczema can be particularly debilitating for individuals, causing pain, discomfort and social isolation. When left untreated or poorly managed, it can lead to significant long-term health complications.

There are currently no specific regulations governing the provision of medical treatment for eczema sufferers in prisons. However, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons Deprived of Liberty, prisoners have the right to access healthcare services that meet their basic needs.

The Scottish Government has been criticized for its failure to address this issue adequately. It is estimated that there are thousands of people in Scotland's prisons who suffer from chronic health conditions such as eczema, yet they receive very little support or care from prison authorities.

In response to these concerns, the Scottish Parliament has launched an independent review into the provision of healthcare services in prisons. The review will examine current practices and identify areas for improvement, including the development of new guidelines for managing eczema and other chronic health conditions in prisons.

It is hoped that this review will help to ensure that all prisoners receive the care and support they deserve, regardless of their health status. In particular, it is vital that those with chronic health conditions like eczema are treated fairly and given the resources they need to manage their conditions effectively.

However, even if new guidelines are implemented, the problem of poor healthcare in prisons remains. Many prisoners continue to experience neglectful and unresponsive behavior from prison staff, which exacerbates existing health problems and makes it harder for them to recover.

Furthermore, there is a risk that any improvements made could be undermined by budget cuts and resource constraints, as has happened in many other areas of public service in recent years.

Despite these challenges, there must remain a strong commitment to ensuring that everyone in our society, including those in our criminal justice system, has access to quality healthcare services that respect their dignity and protect their human rights. Only then can we hope to build a fairer and more just society for all.",mistral7b,1

Title: Scottish Prison Chief Escapes After Being Allowed Out; Nicola Sturgeon Demands Answers

Michael Ferguson, a 36-year-old former soldier turned convicted murderer, made headlines on Friday when he managed to escape from the high-security Carstairs unit in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. His disappearance sparked widespread concern and outrage, particularly given his violent past and the fact that he had only been released temporarily.

Ferguson, who is serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Lisa Marie Colvin, was granted temporary release from prison as part of an ongoing review of his case by the Parole Board for Scotland (PBS). However, it is still unclear how he was able to evade security measures at the facility and make his way to freedom.

The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, quickly issued a statement condemning the circumstances surrounding Ferguson's escape, calling it ""totally unacceptable"" and demanding answers from the PBS and the Scottish government. She also expressed her sympathy to those affected by the incident, including Colvin's family and friends.

Sturgeon went further, calling on Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf to take responsibility for what she saw as a failure to properly monitor Ferguson during his time outside of prison. She insisted that such incidents could not be ignored or brushed aside, and that they highlighted serious flaws within the criminal justice system.

Yousaf responded to Sturgeon's demands by promising to launch a full review of the situation and work closely with the PBS to identify any gaps in the current procedures for managing prisoners on temporary release. He also reiterated his commitment to ensuring public safety and protecting vulnerable members of society from individuals like Ferguson.

However, critics argue that the SNP and the Scottish government have long been too lenient towards criminals, allowing them back into society without proper safeguards in place. They point to cases like Ferguson's as evidence of this lax approach, which they say puts innocent people at risk.

In recent years, there have been several instances where convicted killers have managed to escape from Scottish prisons, leading to fears that the country's criminal justice system is failing to keep dangerous offenders under control. In addition, there are concerns that the use of electronic tagging devices, which are often used to monitor prisoners on temporary release, may not be enough to prevent escapes and ensure their safe return to custody.

As debate rages over the circumstances surrounding Michael Ferguson's escape and its implications for the wider criminal justice system, many are left wondering whether the SNP and the Scottish government will take the necessary steps to address the underlying issues that allow such incidents to occur in the first place.",mistral7b,1

In an effort to rally support for his party ahead of next month's general election, Prime Minister Gordon Brown addressed the Labour Party's annual spring conference in Gateshead today. The chancellor used his speech to paint a stark picture of what he warned could happen if the Conservatives win power, claiming that their policies would lead to deep cuts in public services such as the National Health Service (NHS).

""The vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a clear and fundamental choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts,"" Brown told the crowd of supporters gathered in the city center. ""We have always believed that our country needs strong, stable leadership - and that means investing in the future of our public services.""

Brown also took aim at the Tories for their plans to increase taxes on low-income earners, warning that this move would only serve to further exacerbate economic inequality. He argued that Labour's policies were much more equitable and would provide a fairer distribution of wealth throughout society.

""Let me be absolutely clear: we are not prepared to see hardworking families struggling to make ends meet while the wealthy few enjoy ever greater prosperity,"" Brown said. ""Labour is committed to ensuring that everyone has access to the opportunities they need to succeed - from education to healthcare, and beyond.""

During his address, Brown also highlighted the progress made by Labour under his leadership since coming to power in 2007. He pointed to improvements in unemployment rates, increased funding for schools, and advances in medical research as just a few examples of what he called Labor's commitment to improving people's lives.

However, critics argue that many of these achievements can be attributed to factors such as a global economic boom rather than any specific policy initiatives taken by Brown or his government. Some even question whether the current state of the economy would actually improve under Conservative rule, given their emphasis on cutting government spending rather than increasing it.

Despite these concerns, Brown remains optimistic about Labour's chances of winning another term in office come May. In fact, he believes that recent polling suggests that support for his party is actually growing stronger, especially among young voters who may be disillusioned with traditional political parties like the Conservatives.

""There is no doubt that there is a new spirit of optimism emerging across the UK,"" Brown said. ""People want change - and I believe that change starts here, with Labour.""

With just over three weeks left before the general election takes place, both major parties continue to campaign tirelessly in order to convince voters of their respective merits. While neither side appears poised to gain a decisive advantage, it remains to be seen which party will ultimately emerge victorious when all the ballots have been counted.",mistral7b,1

The anniversary of 12 years of violence and destruction in Wales was marked this weekend by renewed calls for justice over the bombings carried out by the shadowy Meibion Glyndwr. The group, believed to be responsible for dozens of attacks across Wales between 1978 and 1993, targeted public buildings including police stations, schools and post offices. As many as 40 people were injured and two killed during the campaign of terror.

Plaid Cymru leader Elfyn Llwyd, who was born just after the bombing campaign began, has suggested that the UK security services may have played a role in the attacks. He believes that the aim was to undermine nationalism in Wales and discredit those fighting for greater autonomy. Mr Llwyd called on the government to release more information about the investigation into the bombings and demanded an independent review of how they were carried out.

""There are serious questions that remain unanswered,"" he said. ""We need to know what really happened. We cannot allow these atrocities to be swept under the carpet. It is time for the truth to come out.""

The Welsh Government has previously stated that there will be no further investigations into the bombings unless new evidence comes to light. However, the call for justice from Plaid Cymru has prompted many others to revisit the case and demand answers. Many believe that the true extent of the involvement of the security forces remains hidden behind closed doors.

As the anniversary of the bombings approached, tensions rose once again in Wales. There were reports of increased surveillance activity and heightened security measures in place in various parts of the country. Some saw these actions as evidence of a continued threat posed by Meibion Glyndwr or similar groups. Others feared that the legacy of the bombings would continue to cast a pall over efforts to bring peace and stability to Wales.

Despite the ongoing debates and concerns, many people in Wales remain committed to honoring the victims of the bombings and working towards healing the wounds left behind. This year's commemorations included a march through Cardiff city center, attended by thousands of people carrying banners bearing messages of hope and unity.

In his speech to the crowds, Mr Llwyd paid tribute to the bravery and resilience of the Welsh people in the face of such horrific acts. He also emphasized the importance of continuing to fight for the rights of the Welsh people, both within the UK and internationally.

""Today we remember those who lost their lives and those who suffered at the hands of terrorists,"" he said. ""But we must not forget our responsibility to keep fighting for freedom, democracy and social justice. Let us stand together to honor their memory and build a brighter future for all of us.""",mistral7b,1

Lord Falconer, the former justice secretary who is now a Labour peer and a member of the House of Lords, has spoken out against the government's decision to make last-minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill. He argued that it was unfair to criticize the move, but he did acknowledge that it had caused chaos in the House of Commons. The bill aims to improve protections for people with mental health conditions, including those who lack capacity to make decisions on their own behalf. However, the proposed amendments were introduced at the eleventh hour, causing confusion and frustration among MPs.

The changes were prompted by concerns from campaigners, particularly those who represent the interests of family members and loved ones of people affected by dementia. They argued that the original version of the bill failed to provide adequate protection for these individuals, as it allowed them to be subjected to coercive measures without proper safeguards. While the government acknowledged this concern, many MPs felt that introducing the amendments so close to the end of the parliamentary session was an act of desperation rather than genuine commitment to improving patient rights.

As the debate raged on, there were reports of ministers panicking in the background, trying to negotiate a compromise between different factions within their party. It was unclear whether these negotiations had anything to do with the introduction of the amendments, or whether they simply represented an attempt to avoid a potentially embarrassing defeat on the floor of the Commons. Whatever the reason, it seemed clear that the government was under significant pressure to make concessions to its critics.

Despite the chaos surrounding the vote, Lord Falconer insisted that it was still possible to achieve meaningful reform through a process of careful negotiation and consensus-building. He pointed out that the Mental Capacity Act had already been passed into law, and that any further changes would need to be carefully considered before being implemented. This view was shared by many other observers, who warned that hasty amendments could undermine the integrity of the legislation as a whole.

However, others saw the government's actions as a sign of weakness, and called for a more radical overhaul of the existing framework. They argued that too much power was currently held by healthcare professionals and legal experts, and that patients themselves needed greater control over their own care. This argument gained momentum in recent years, following high-profile cases such as that of Tom Best, whose mother refused life-sustaining treatment despite having Alzheimer's disease. These cases raised questions about the balance between autonomy and paternalism in medical decision-making, and highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability within the system.

In response to these concerns, the government has announced plans to launch a comprehensive review of the Mental Health Act, which will examine all aspects of the current framework and explore ways to empower patients and families more effectively. However, critics argue that this is not enough, and that fundamental reform is required if the UK is to build a truly patient-centered care model. As the debate continues, one thing seems certain: the future of mental health policy in the UK is likely to remain a contentious issue for many years to come.",mistral7b,1

The government's proposed legislation is facing a major hurdle as Tories, Liberal Democrats and some Labour MPs threaten to vote against it. The move comes after concerns were raised over the impact on civil liberties.

The controversial bill aims to give intelligence agencies sweeping surveillance powers, including access to people's internet activity and emails without their knowledge or consent. It also allows for the use of secret courts to hear cases involving national security issues.

Despite this opposition, Home Secretary Theresa May remains determined to see the bill pass through parliament. She has argued that the measures are necessary to protect the country from terror threats. In an interview, she said: ""We need these powers to keep our citizens safe and prevent terrorist attacks.""

However, critics argue that such measures go too far and could infringe on people's privacy rights. They point out that there have been several high-profile cases where innocent individuals have been wrongly accused and imprisoned due to similar legislation.

Among those leading the charge against the bill is former home secretary Charles Clarke. He has spoken out strongly against the measure, arguing that it is not only unnecessary but also dangerous. He said: ""These powers would allow the authorities to spy on anyone they choose, regardless of whether they are suspected of any crime at all. This is a gross violation of people's fundamental freedoms and I will do everything in my power to stop it from happening.""

As the debate continues, tensions are rising between the government and its opponents. Some members of the public have expressed support for the bill, believing that it will help to keep them safe from terrorism. Others worry that such measures could lead to an erosion of civil liberties and a loss of individual freedom.

One key issue is the question of accountability. If intelligence agencies are allowed to conduct mass surveillance without oversight or judicial review, who will be held responsible if something goes wrong? Critics argue that this lack of transparency and scrutiny could lead to abuses of power.

Despite these concerns, supporters of the bill believe that it is necessary to stay ahead of evolving threats posed by terrorists. They argue that the world has changed significantly since September 11 and that new methods must be developed to combat modern terrorism.

In conclusion, the proposed legislation faces significant opposition as Tories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs prepare to vote against it. While the government argues that the measures are necessary to protect the country from terror threats, critics warn that they could go too far and infringe on people's privacy rights. As the debate continues, it remains unclear whether the bill will ultimately be passed into law.",mistral7b,1

In recent years, political figures have been affected by various health issues, including dementia. One such individual is the late Sir Nicholas Goodman, who was known for his service as the former Conservative MP for Kensington and Chelsea. He had a distinguished career that spanned over four decades before he succumbed to a long illness diagnosed as Alzheimer's at the age of 71. His death has left many mourning the loss of an influential figure in British politics.

Goodman first entered Parliament in 1979 and held several high positions within the party. However, it was his time serving in Northern Ireland that truly defined his legacy. From 1981 to 1987, he worked under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher and played an instrumental role in shaping policy decisions related to the region. Many credit him for his unwavering commitment to finding solutions to complex issues facing Northern Ireland at the time.

Despite his impressive accomplishments, Goodman remained humble and dedicated to public service. Even after retiring from politics in the early 2000s, he continued to advocate for causes he cared deeply about, including mental health awareness and social justice. His contributions to the field of politics will not be forgotten anytime soon.

As politicians continue to grapple with the realities of aging and health issues, stories like Sir Nicholas Goodman's serve as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing wellness and addressing these challenges head on.

Swansea: A City of Diversity and Inclusion

Swansea, located in southwest Wales, has long been known for its rich history and vibrant culture. However, it is also a city that faces significant challenges related to racism and intolerance. Anti-racism campaigners in the area are taking steps to address these issues by working closely with law enforcement officials and local communities.

Recently, anti-racism campaigners in Swansea have handed copies to South Wales Police of their latest report on hate crimes in the region. The report highlights the impact of racism on individuals and communities, as well as providing recommendations on how to prevent such incidents from occurring.

South Wales Police Chief Constable Mark Jones welcomed the report, stating, ""We take any form of discrimination seriously and will continue to work with our partners in the community to ensure that all residents feel safe and included in our city.""

As part of this ongoing effort to promote diversity and inclusion in Swansea, the city's Muslim community is currently raising funds to open a new mosque and community center in the former St Andrews United Reform Church. This project aims to provide a space where Muslims can practice their faith while also contributing positively to the broader community.

Local leaders have expressed support for the project, with council member Mohammed Ali stating, ""This new mosque and community center will not only serve the needs of Swansea's Muslim community but also bring people together from different backgrounds and cultures.""

Despite the positive efforts being made in Swansea to combat racism and promote inclusivity, there remains much work to be done. As a diverse city, it is important that we all come together to create an environment that celebrates difference and promotes respect and understanding among all members of our community.",mistral7b,1

London Mayor Boris Johnson has criticised Labour for failing to tackle crime and poverty levels in the city. He also accused the party of not doing enough to help small businesses during the pandemic. In response to these claims, Mr Livingstone, the former mayor of London, defended Labour's record and said that the current government was responsible for much of the problem. However, he did admit that there were areas where Labour could have done more.

Meanwhile, in other political developments, Mr Blair has been under fire for his comments about the press. During a recent interview, he accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a ""concentration camp guard"". The journalist, who has not been named, has since spoken out and called for an apology from the ex-prime minister. Mr Blair has refused to back down from his statement, saying that it was accurate and necessary to expose the behavior of journalists.

However, many have criticized the comparison between journalists and concentration camp guards as insensitive and offensive. Some politicians have called for Mr Blair to issue a public apology, while others have condemned him for his choice of words. Despite this controversy, Mr Blair has remained steadfast in his position and has not shown any signs of regret or remorse for his actions.

In another development, the UK government has announced plans to introduce new legislation aimed at tackling online hate speech. The bill will allow authorities to take down content that promotes extremism or incitement to violence. This move has been welcomed by many as a long overdue step towards protecting vulnerable communities from harmful online activity.

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the globe are facing increasing pressure to provide support to those affected by its economic fallout.

""I know we will have our differences, but I believe that if we stand strong and united, we can overcome any challenge."" The president's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was ""fractured, divided and uncertain"". Mr Blair said it had to be brought together, adding that action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey.

The election results were met with mixed reactions from politicians and citizens alike. Some saw it as a victory for democracy and stability in the United States, while others expressed concern over issues such as healthcare and education. Despite this, many leaders around the world welcomed the outcome and pledged to continue working closely with the US to promote peace and prosperity.

One key issue that Mr Bush is likely to focus on during his second term is the ongoing conflict in Iraq. He has faced criticism from opponents who argue that the war has been costly and unsuccessful in achieving its goals. However, the president remains committed to bringing an end to the violence and restoring stability to the region. He has already ordered an additional 17,500 troops to the area and is expected to announce further measures soon.

Another major challenge facing the administration is global poverty. Mr Bush has made combating poverty a top priority, and he plans to use his second term to push for greater economic development in Africa and other parts of the developing world. This includes initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, promoting entrepreneurship and increasing access to education and healthcare.

Overall, Mr Bush's second term presents both opportunities and challenges for his presidency. While there are certainly obstacles ahead, the president has demonstrated his ability to adapt and persevere through difficult times. With the support of Congress and his allies, Mr Bush can continue leading America towards a brighter future.",mistral7b,1

John Howard, the former Prime Minister of Australia, has defended his decision to attend a snooker hall during his teenage years as not causing any long-lasting harm to himself or anyone else. However, Mr Howard also spoke out against truancy, saying it is a serious issue that requires firm action. He made these comments while speaking to the Times Educational Supplement.

When asked about his experiences at the Jack's Snooker Hall in Llanelli, which he frequented in the 1950s, Mr Howard replied, ""I don't think I did myself any lasting damage going there, but obviously it wasn't something you should be doing all the time."" He went on to explain how he learned valuable life skills from playing snooker and how it helped him become more disciplined and focused.

Despite his positive memories of attending the snooker hall, Mr Howard acknowledged that it could have been a negative influence if he had spent too much time there. He urged young people today to make responsible choices when it comes to their leisure activities and to remember the importance of education.

In addition to discussing his own experiences, Mr Howard also spoke out strongly against truancy. He described it as ""very bad"" and said that schools need to take a firmer stance on absenteeism. He argued that truancy can lead to academic failure, lower earning potential, and other problems later in life, such as substance abuse and criminal activity.

Overall, Mr Howard emphasized the importance of making smart decisions early in life and the value of discipline and focus. While he may have enjoyed his visits to the snooker hall in his youth, he recognized the potential dangers of excessive partying and encouraged others to strive for balance and responsibility in all aspects of their lives.",mistral7b,1

Politics is often full of surprises and announcements that can shake up global alliances and partnerships. In recent news, President Bush has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding a new humanitarian initiative. An alliance of the United States, India, Australia, and Japan will coordinate a massive relief effort for countries affected by natural disasters. This move is being hailed as a major step towards addressing global poverty and helping those who need it most.

However, not everyone is happy with this development. According to British politician Harriet Harman, the formation of this coalition could have negative consequences for the international community. She believes that such an endeavor will weaken the authority of organizations like the United Nations (UN) and reduce their ability to provide aid to those in need.

Ms Harman's comments have sparked debate among political leaders and analysts alike. Some argue that the new coalition represents a positive shift towards greater cooperation and coordination in addressing global problems. Others worry that this could lead to further fragmentation of the global response to crises, making it harder for governments to work together effectively.

Despite these concerns, the announcement of the new humanitarian coalition has been widely welcomed. Many see it as a sign of renewed commitment from world powers to address pressing social issues. As politicians continue to debate the implications of this development, one thing is clear: the future of global cooperation remains uncertain. It will be interesting to see how this new alignment plays out and what impact it has on global politics.",mistral7b,1

1. In a significant development, Tory spokesman David Davis announced that the UK's ability to veto who is allowed entry into the country may be limited by an upcoming vote on immigration policies within the European Union (EU). According to Mr Davis, the EU is considering adopting a new system called qualified majority voting (QMV) for determining which immigrants are allowed to enter member countries. This would mean that individual member states no longer have complete control over their own borders, as decisions would be made through consensus-building processes involving multiple countries.
2. Supporters of QMV argue that it will help streamline the immigration process and reduce bureaucratic red tape. Under current rules, each member state must unanimously agree to every immigrant's admission before they can enter the country. This often results in lengthy delays and backlogs, particularly when dealing with large numbers of applicants. By allowing for more efficient decision-making, QMV could potentially speed up the application process while still ensuring that appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect public safety and national security.
3. However, critics of QMV warn that it could lead to significant losses of sovereignty for individual member states. Some worry that decisions made under QMV could conflict with domestic laws or priorities, leading to legal challenges and political tensions within the EU. Others fear that QMV could ultimately lead to greater centralization of authority within Brussels, further undermining the autonomy of individual countries and their ability to respond quickly to local issues and concerns.
4. As the debate over QMV continues, there are also broader implications for the future of Brexit negotiations between the UK and other EU member states. If QMV were adopted in full, it could potentially weaken the UK's negotiating position by reducing its leverage over immigration policy discussions. On the other hand, supporters of QMV see it as a way to demonstrate the UK's commitment to cooperation and compromise within the EU, which could strengthen relations between London and Brussels in other areas such as trade and economic integration.
5. Despite these complexities, it remains clear that QMV represents a major shift in how immigration policies are determined within the EU. While exact details of how the new system will work remain uncertain, it is likely that the UK will face significant challenges in navigating this changing landscape. Whether through diplomacy, negotiation, or unilateral action, the British government will need to carefully consider its options and weigh the potential risks and benefits of different approaches in order to maintain its influence on key immigration policies.",mistral7b,1

Title: Prime Minister's Wife Criticized For Praising Supreme Court Ruling Against Trump Administration

In an interview with the BBC, Boris Johnson's wife Carrie Johnson expressed her admiration for the US Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Donald Trump's executive order on the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. According to reports, Mrs. Johnson stated that she believed the court had made the right decision and that it was important to protect the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or status. However, this statement has been met with criticism from many quarters.

The Conservative Party said Mrs. Johnson's actions were unacceptable as they breached the convention that British political figures should refrain from engaging in partisan activities while overseas. It added that the UK government had consistently condemned the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay and that such comments undermined its efforts to promote democracy and human rights globally.

Mrs. Johnson's intervention sparked a debate on whether politicians should be allowed to express their personal views publicly while representing their country. Some argued that Mrs. Johnson had every right to speak out on issues she cared deeply about, but others feared that her actions could harm the UK's diplomatic relations with the United States.

As tensions between the UK and US continue to rise, questions remain about how far politicians can go without risking damaging international cooperation. While Mrs. Johnson may believe she was simply expressing her opinions, the fallout from her comments highlights the complexities surrounding the role of political spouses in modern-day diplomacy.",mistral7b,1

Peter Mandelson has been accused of being involved in a ""dirty tricks"" campaign against his political rival, Lord Ashcroft. The accusation came after it was revealed that the Conservative Party had hired private investigators to gather information on Mandelson's past business dealings.

Lord Ashcroft, the millionaire businessman, had previously criticized Mandelson for his close ties to the billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska. In response to this criticism, Manderson claimed that he had not received any money from Deripaska and that there was nothing untoward about their relationship. However, the Tories pointed out that Manderson had once described Deripaska as a ""friend"".

Despite these revelations, Manderson denied any wrongdoing and called the charges baseless. He also accused the Conservatives of trying to smear him and distract attention away from issues such as poverty and inequality.

Meanwhile, the European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. This allegation comes as the Tory party continues to face criticism over its handling of the expenses scandal. The Tories have so far faced numerous calls to resign due to their involvement in the scandal.

In response to the accusations, Manderson denied any involvement in dirty tricks campaigns against other politicians. He added that the Tories were simply trying to divert attention away from their own failures.

As the debate continued, Manderson remained steadfast in denying any wrongdoing or involvement in ""dirty trick"" campaigns. He also emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in government, arguing that the current system was too opaque and lacked oversight.

Despite his efforts to clear his name, Manderson's reputation remains tarnished. Many believe that his close association with wealthy businessmen like Deripaska raises questions about his judgment and integrity.

However, Manderson insists that he is committed to serving the public interest and will continue to work tirelessly to promote equality and justice. As the election approaches, it remains to be seen how voters will react to these latest developments and whether they will ultimately decide to give the Conservatives another chance.",mistral7b,1

1) In response to the growing concerns over terrorism, several high-ranking officials have called for increased surveillance measures in public places across the country. However, Norfolk police chief Andy Hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed before such measures could be implemented effectively.

""There is no doubt that we need to take action to address this threat,"" said Mr. Hayman, speaking at a press conference held by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). ""But we must also recognize that any new powers or tools we may use must be carefully considered and tested to ensure they do not infringe on individual rights or create false sense of security.""

His comments come amid mounting tension between civil liberties groups and law enforcement agencies over the use of CCTV cameras and other surveillance techniques. Some activists have expressed concern that these technologies are being used too extensively and without proper oversight, leading to potential abuses of power by authorities.

Mr. Hayman acknowledged these concerns but insisted that there were no easy answers when it came to balancing national security interests with individual freedoms. He pointed out that while surveillance can be an effective tool in preventing crime and terrorist attacks, it could also lead to unintended consequences if not properly managed.

For example, the widespread use of CCTV cameras has been shown to disproportionately target certain communities, often those with higher rates of criminal activity. This could result in further stigmatization and discrimination against already vulnerable groups, potentially exacerbating tensions within society.

In light of these challenges, Mr. Hayman urged caution and cooperation among all stakeholders involved in the fight against terrorism. He emphasized the importance of working closely with local communities to build trust and understanding, as well as engaging constructive dialogue with civil liberty organizations to find common ground.

2) Another key figure calling for greater surveillance measures is Home Secretary Theresa May. Speaking at a recent parliamentary debate, she argued that the UK faced a ""serious and evolving threat from extremist violence"" and that more resources needed to be dedicated towards counterterrorism efforts.

However, Ms. May also recognized the need for careful consideration when it came to implementing new surveillance technologies. She acknowledged that any such measures must be designed in a way that respects individual privacy and human rights, while also maximizing their effectiveness in combatting terrorism.

Her sentiments echoed those of many other politicians and experts, who have long grappled with how best to balance competing priorities in the age of global terrorism. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, policymakers will need to remain vigilant and adapt their strategies accordingly, without losing sight of core principles of freedom and justice.

Despite ongoing debates over surveillance policies, there remains broad consensus among political leaders that something needs to be done to better protect citizens from the risks associated with radical Islamist extremism. Whether through increased funding for intelligence gathering, stricter border control measures, or enhanced surveillance capabilities, most agree that action must be taken to prevent future attacks.

Title: MP Calls For Stricter Enforcement Of Law Banning Sale Of Adult Games To Kids

In an effort to protect young children from violent content, Patricia Hewitt has called for stricter enforcement of the law that bans the sale of 18-rated games to kids. The former health secretary made her concerns known during a meeting with representatives from the games industry on Sunday. According to reports, she expressed concern that not enough was being done to prevent children from accessing adult games that contained high levels of violence and other mature themes.

The ban on the sale of 18-rated games to underage individuals has been in place since 2004, but it appears that some retailers may still be selling them to minors. This raises questions about the effectiveness of current regulations and whether they need to be strengthened. Some parents and child safety advocates have long argued that video games can desensitize children to violence and other harmful behaviors, making them more likely to engage in such activities in real life.

Hewitt's call for stronger enforcement of the existing ban comes as part of a broader push to improve online child protection measures. In recent years, there have been increasing reports of cyberbullying, sexting, and other forms of online harassment targeting young people. As technology continues to evolve, experts warn that these types of threats will only become more prevalent unless new safeguards are put in place.

To address this issue, Hewitt has proposed several measures, including increased funding for schools to hire more counselors and support staff, improved communication between teachers, parents, and law enforcement agencies, and greater transparency in social media platforms to help identify potential sources of harm. While some of these ideas have faced criticism or resistance, others have received broad support across political lines.

Overall, Hewitt's comments highlight the ongoing struggle to balance freedom of speech with responsibility to protect vulnerable populations, particularly children. In the case of violent video games, the question remains whether the benefits of artistic expression outweigh the risks posed by exposure to graphic imagery and other potentially triggering content. Whether or not Hewitt's proposals ultimately succeed in achieving their intended goal, one thing is clear: the debate over the appropriate role of government in regulating entertainment and other aspects of modern life is far from settled.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:
Robocop Clashes With No Campaigner Over Police Reform Proposal
On Thursday, the former police chief, known as Robocop for his strict enforcement approach, faced off against Sunderland No campaigner Neil Herron during a public hearing on police reform proposals. The debate centered around the proposed establishment of an independent police commissioner who would have greater authority to set policies and hold officers accountable.
Herron argued that giving more power to the commissioner would lead to less community control and oversight, while Robocop emphasized the need for stronger leadership and accountability within the force. The exchange was heated, with both sides making passionate arguments for their respective positions. Ultimately, the committee voted in favor of moving forward with the proposal, but it remains unclear how much support it will receive from the wider community.
In a related development, Northern Ireland's DUP leader Arlene Foster has expressed her support for the idea of establishing an independent police commissioner in the region. She believes that such a move would help to restore public trust in the force and ensure that it operates independently of political interference. However, critics argue that this could undermine the principle of democratic accountability and weaken the role of elected representatives in holding the police to task.
As tensions continue to rise between proponents and opponents of police reform, it is clear that the issue remains deeply divisive. While many see the need for greater transparency and accountability within the forces, others worry that these changes could have unintended consequences and threaten the very fabric of law and order. As policymakers grapple with these complex questions, it will be important to carefully consider the potential implications of any decisions made and work towards solutions that uphold the principles of fairness, justice, and democracy.
Article 2:
Assembly Could Give Local People More Say In Key Issues
Sinn Fein MLA John Mallon has announced plans to propose legislation that would establish an Assembly for Northern Ireland, allowing for greater local representation and decision-making powers. According to Mallon, an Assembly would enable communities to have more of a voice in shaping key issues such as transportation and public safety.
Mallon cited the example of Belfast City Council's recent decision to ban cars from certain streets as evidence of the importance of local input in policy-making. He argued that by empowering communities to make decisions directly, rather than relying on centralized authorities, the region could become more responsive and better equipped to address the needs of its citizens.
However, not everyone is convinced that an Assembly is the best solution to Northern Ireland's problems. Some critics worry that such a move could lead to further fragmentation and instability in the region, as well as increased costs associated with setting up and running a new legislative body. Additionally, there are concerns about how effectively local voices would be represented in such an environment, given the historical legacy of sectarianism and division.
Despite these challenges, supporters of the Assembly idea believe that it holds significant promise for improving governance and accountability in Northern Ireland. They point to successful examples of devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, where local representation has led to greater innovation and responsiveness in policy-making. If implemented effectively, an Assembly could provide a valuable platform for building bridges across divides and working together to create a better future for all of Northern Ireland's citizens.",mistral7b,1

In a shocking revelation, it has been announced that the government's decision to cut police funding has caused major concerns among law enforcement officials. Spokesman David Davis revealed that ministers had failed to make his party aware of these concerns before they were made public, causing widespread outrage and confusion among members of the community.

Notts Police Chief Steve Green was particularly vocal about his concerns, stating that innocent people will suffer as a result of the cuts. He explained that reducing resources for policing can lead to an increase in criminal activity and antisocial behavior, putting individuals at risk.

The announcement comes after weeks of protests from police unions calling for increased funding and support. The union's leader, Tom Watson, expressed disappointment in the government's failure to address their demands.

""It is deeply concerning that the government continues to ignore the warnings of our officers on the front lines,"" he said. ""These cuts will not only put the safety of our communities at risk but also undermine morale and productivity within the force.""

Opposition parties have also weighed in on the issue, with many condemning the government's actions. Labor MP Emily Thornberry called on the Home Secretary Sajid Javid to reconsider the decision and prioritize public safety over financial savings.

""This decision by this government to cut police funding is short-sighted and dangerous,"" she said. ""We cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by cost cutting when it comes to keeping our streets safe.""

As tensions continue to rise between the government and law enforcement officials, there are growing calls for a review of current policies surrounding policing and crime prevention. Many experts believe that without sufficient funding and resources, it will become increasingly difficult for police forces to effectively combat rising levels of crime and disorder.",mistral7b,1

Edward Leigh, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman, gave a statement regarding a report released by the National Audit Office (NAO). The report highlighted important lessons that could help prevent another major livestock disease outbreak like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), which hit the UK in 2011.

Leigh commended the efforts of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in enhancing their abilities to manage any potential future livestock diseases. According to him, the NAO's findings showed that there were significant improvements made by Defra in this area since FMD struck the UK. He added that he hoped these changes would ensure that the country remained protected against such events going forward.

The PAC chairman also pointed out that the NAO report provided valuable insights into what went wrong during the FMD outbreak. This information can serve as an educational tool not only for Defra but also for other government agencies involved in animal health management, helping them learn from past mistakes.

In addition, Leigh emphasized on the need for greater transparency when dealing with issues related to livestock diseases. He believed that if all stakeholders are open and honest about their role and responsibilities, then it would be easier to identify problems early on and take corrective measures before they escalate into full-blown crises.

Meanwhile, the Animal Health and Welfare Board for England (AHWBE) has welcomed the NAO report and expressed satisfaction with the progress made by Defra in strengthening its capacity to handle future livestock disease outbreaks. AHWBE Chairman Dr. Peter Mansbridge stated that while there is still much work to do, he remains optimistic that the UK will continue to maintain high standards of animal health and welfare in the coming years.

However, critics have questioned whether enough has been done to address the root causes of the FMD outbreak, including concerns over the way culling operations were carried out and the communication strategies employed by the government at the time. Some argue that more needs to be done to improve public trust in the veterinary profession and enhance collaboration between different organizations working towards animal health and welfare goals.

Overall, the release of the NAO report provides both a cause for celebration and concern for those involved in managing livestock diseases in the UK. While significant progress has been made in recent years, there is still much work to be done to ensure that the country remains prepared to face any potential future threats to animal health and wellbeing.",mistral7b,1

The British government has been facing criticism over its decision to send a diplomatic mission to Iran to negotiate the release of an imprisoned nuclear scientist. This comes as news emerged this week that all four Britons held by the US in the Cuban camp will soon be released. According to reports, the UK government is working tirelessly to secure the safe return of these citizens before they are deported back to the UK later this year.

In response to this news, political leaders from across the spectrum have expressed their relief and gratitude for the efforts being made to bring these innocent individuals home. However, not everyone has been so pleased with the UK's actions. Some critics argue that sending a delegation to Iran could lead to further tensions between the two countries, particularly given Tehran's controversial nuclear program. Others fear that any negotiations with the Islamic republic may result in concessions being made at the expense of national security.

Despite these concerns, many politicians have stressed the importance of securing the safe return of the four British nationals, who have spent years in captivity following their arrest in Iran in 2009. As one MP put it, ""These individuals deserve to be reunited with their families and loved ones as quickly as possible. It is our duty as a responsible government to work tirelessly towards achieving this goal.""

Meanwhile, in South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called on President Jacob Zuma to end arbitrary detention and free those still languishing behind bars. In a letter to Zuma earlier this month, the former anti-apartheid leader said he was ""deeply distressed"" by the ongoing practice of holding people without charge or trial, which he described as ""a violation of fundamental human rights"". He added: ""This practice must come to an end immediately if we are to build a better future for ourselves and generations to come.""

Tutu's call for greater respect for individual liberties comes amid rising tension between the ruling party and civil society groups, who have accused Zuma of cracking down on dissent and undermining democracy. While the president has denied these allegations, his administration has faced criticism for its handling of corruption scandals involving state officials and businessmen close to the ruling elite.

As such, Tutu's intervention marks an important moment in South Africa's ongoing struggle for democratic reform, highlighting the need for greater accountability and transparency in government. His message serves as a reminder to all those in positions of power that they have a responsibility to uphold the values upon which the country was founded - justice, equality, and respect for the rule of law.",mistral7b,1

The political climate is tense as reports emerge that the UK government may be planning to launch a preemptive strike against Iran's nuclear program. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to comment on the rumors, saying only that the government was focused on ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East region. However, sources close to the government have confirmed that there has been ongoing discussions between officials regarding the possibility of military action against Iran. This comes after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the historic nuclear deal signed by his predecessor Barack Obama, leaving many countries concerned about Tehran's nuclear capabilities. Some experts predict that without the constraints imposed by the deal, Iran could develop a weapons program within months, posing a serious threat to global security.

Political tension continues to rise between India and Indonesia as both countries prepare for a possible military intervention in the disputed Aceh province. The Indian government has announced its intention to deploy troops to the region in order to protect its citizens living there, citing concerns over rising terrorism and separatist movements.

However, the decision to send troops to the area has been met with criticism by human rights groups and local leaders who fear that it could lead to further conflict and violence. There are also fears that the deployment could be seen as an attempt to exert greater control over the region, which is currently under the jurisdiction of Indonesia.

Indonesia's foreign minister Retno Marsudi has called on India to reconsider its plans, stating that any such action must be done through diplomatic channels and not through the use of force. She also warned that any military intervention could harm bilateral relations between the two countries.

Despite these calls, however, the Indian government remains committed to protecting its interests in the region. It has already sent troops to several other areas near the border with Indonesia in recent years, including in the North Sumatra province.

The deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province.

It is worth noting that while tensions between India and Indonesia may seem high at the moment, they have historically maintained strong ties and cooperation. Both countries share economic and cultural links, making efforts to resolve their differences all the more important for regional stability.",mistral7b,1

The latest round of talks between Israel and Palestine have hit a snag following recent attacks by Hamas militants on Israeli soldiers stationed along the Gaza Strip border. In response to these attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for increased military presence in the region. This move has been widely criticized by international leaders as escalating tensions further and potentially leading to another conflict.

Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has condemned the attacks and reiterated his commitment to peace negotiations with Israel. In an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, he said such attacks were against Palestinian interests. He emphasized that the Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting ""a 100% effort"" to end the violence, which has caused widespread suffering among civilians living near the border.

Despite these efforts, many experts believe that any progress made in negotiations will be short-lived until there is significant change in Israeli policies towards Palestinians. Specifically, they are calling for greater accountability for human rights abuses committed during Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a more inclusive approach to negotiating future borders and settlements.

Abbas himself acknowledged the challenges facing both sides in achieving lasting peace. He spoke out against the use of violence by extremists on all sides, including Hamas and other militant groups who oppose the two-state solution. However, he also noted the need for greater understanding and empathy from Israeli leaders and citizens towards Palestinians who have lived under occupation for decades.

As tensions rise and violence continues, it remains unclear whether this latest round of talks will lead to meaningful breakthroughs or simply push the parties further apart. Despite ongoing calls for diplomacy and dialogue, many remain skeptical about the prospects for peace and fear that any new developments could ultimately lead to war.",mistral7b,1

Civil service workers in Wales took part in a national industrial action on Wednesday, causing disruptions across various government departments and public sector organizations. The move came after months of failed negotiations between trade unions and the government over pay and working conditions.

The strike, organized by the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), saw thousands of employees taking to picket lines outside key government buildings across Wales. Many also marched through central London in protest against what they claim are years of underfunding and neglect of the civil service.

As a result of the walkout, several Welsh government departments experienced significant delays and cancellations of appointments and meetings. Some local authorities and health boards also reported disruptions to their services, including difficulties processing applications for benefits and passports.

""We regret that the PCS has chosen to take this course of action,"" said a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office in Wales. ""Our priority is always to ensure that our staff can deliver high-quality services to the public, but we cannot ignore the concerns of those who work hard every day to support our communities and families across Wales.""

In response to the strike, the union's leader claimed that the civil service had been undervalued and overlooked for far too long. ""For decades now, civil service workers have faced real terms pay cuts and an erosion of their rights and protections,"" he said. ""This strikes show just how fed up and angry people are at being ignored.""

The impact of the strike was felt not only in Wales but also in other parts of the United Kingdom. In England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, many civil service offices closed or reduced their opening hours in solidarity with their counterparts in Wales.

Despite calls from opposition politicians for the strike to be suspended, it appears that the dispute will continue well into the new year. The PCSU has already announced plans for further industrial action in January, which could see even more disruptions to essential services in Wales.",mistral7b,1

The battle lines are being drawn between former Justice of the Supreme Court Lord Woolf and the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer over the appointment of judges to head independent inquiries. In a statement to parliament today, Lord Woolf made it clear that he would not back down from his position that judges should be free to make their own decisions regarding whether they wanted to chair such inquiries. He stated that his current veto on the matter was necessary to protect judicial independence. However, Lord Falconer is pushing hard for greater control over these appointments, arguing that judges must first seek approval from him before taking up any role in such inquiries. This has sparked heated debates within legal circles about the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive branch.

Lord Woolf's stance on this issue is consistent with his longstanding belief that the judiciary must remain impartial and independent, even when faced with tough choices. In the past, he has spoken out against attempts by governments to undermine judicial independence through politically motivated appointments or interference in judicial proceedings. His comments today echo those views, and suggest that he sees his current veto as part of a broader effort to defend judicial integrity.

But Lord Falconer disagrees, and says that he believes it is essential for judges to work closely with government officials to ensure that inquiries are conducted in the public interest. He argues that without his oversight, there could be situations where judges might prioritize their own personal interests over the needs of society as a whole. For example, he points to the case of Sir Peter Wright, who resigned as chairman of the Savile Inquiry after criticism of his handling of the investigation. Lord Falconer contends that had he been able to intervene earlier, Wright may have been able to avoid this outcome.

Despite their differences, both Lord Woolf and Lord Falconer agree on one thing: that the appointment process for judges should be transparent and accountable. They also acknowledge that there is no easy answer to the question of how best to achieve this goal, given the complexities involved in balancing the competing demands of justice, efficiency, and political considerations. Nonetheless, they believe that it is important to keep the conversation going, in order to find common ground and reach a solution that works for everyone.

In the meantime, the debate rages on, with each side making its case and trying to gain support among politicians, legal scholars, and members of the public. Some argue that Lord Woolf's approach is too conservative and fails to recognize the need for flexibility in certain circumstances. Others say that Lord Falconer's view is too centralized and risks stifling innovation and creativity within the judiciary. Ultimately, only time will tell which perspective will prevail, but one thing is certain: this is an issue that will continue to shape legal discourse for many years to come.",mistral7b,1

Political parties are gearing up for the upcoming general election, and one of them is making a bold claim that could sway young voters. The Green Party has announced its plan to target students as part of an aggressive campaign strategy aimed at winning over key demographics. According to sources from within the party, the votes of students can win them as many as 27 new seats at the polls if they manage to mobilize them effectively.

""We know that students have been disproportionately impacted by issues like student debt, rising tuition costs, and climate change,"" said Jane Smith, head of the Green Party's youth wing. ""By focusing on these issues and showing that we care deeply about the future of our planet and our communities, we believe that we can win over students across the country.""

To back up this statement, the Green Party has conducted extensive research on voter turnout among students. Figures show that while only about 50 percent of eligible students typically vote, there is significant potential for growth if political parties can engage with them more effectively. In order to do so, the Greens say they plan to focus heavily on social media outreach and organizing events on college campuses.

In addition, the party plans to work closely with student organizations and advocacy groups to amplify their message and build support among young people. They also plan to make use of technology such as mobile apps and online surveys to better understand the concerns and priorities of their target audience.

Despite their ambitious goals, the Green Party knows that they face stiff competition from other major political parties who are likely to spend far more money on advertising and outreach efforts. However, they remain confident that by appealing directly to the values and interests of younger generations, they can carve out a niche for themselves in the political landscape.

""Our goal isn't just to win elections,"" said Smith. ""It's to build a movement that truly represents the needs and aspirations of all Canadians, especially those who have historically been underrepresented or marginalized.""

As the election approaches, political analysts and strategists alike are closely watching the Green Party's every move. While some dismiss their chances outright, others see them as a wild card that could shake up the established order and force other parties to adapt their messaging accordingly. Either way, one thing is clear: the Green Party is not backing down from their fight for a greener, more equitable future for Canada.",mistral7b,1

Politics has always been an important aspect of any society or country, and it plays a crucial role in determining how people live their lives. From healthcare policies to immigration laws, political decisions have a significant impact on individuals and communities alike. In recent years, the topic of immigration has become increasingly contentious, with many countries grappling with how to manage the influx of migrants into their borders. One such issue is the practice of sham marriages, where couples enter into fake marriages purely for the purpose of obtaining legal rights and benefits. To address this problem, the UK government has announced new regulations that require Home Office approval for non-EU citizens looking to get married.

The new policy aims to reduce the number of sham marriages that occur each year, as well as to ensure that only genuine relationships are recognized by the law. According to the Home Office, estimates suggest that there may be as many as 15,000 cases of sham marriages happening annually in the UK. These types of unions can cause problems both for the individuals involved and for the wider community, including issues related to taxation, social welfare, and national security. By implementing these new rules, the government hopes to create a more streamlined process for verifying marriage applications, while also ensuring that those who do get married are genuinely committed to building a life together.

While the goal of the new policy seems commendable, critics argue that it could lead to additional bureaucratic red tape and delays for legitimate applicants. Some have expressed concern that the new requirements could disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, such as refugees and asylum seekers who are already facing significant challenges when trying to integrate into UK society. Others worry that the policy could exacerbate existing tensions between different ethnic and religious groups, leading to further divisions within society.

Despite these concerns, however, supporters of the new policy say that the potential benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. They argue that by cracking down on sham marriages, the government can help protect vulnerable individuals from exploitation and abuse, as well as maintain public trust in the institution of marriage. Additionally, they believe that the new rules will ultimately make it easier for legitimate partners to establish a family and build a life together in the UK, without having to navigate complex bureaucratic processes or fear being separated due to technicalities.

In order to implement the new policy successfully, the Home Office will need to work closely with other government agencies and stakeholders to ensure that everyone understands how the new regulations work and what is required of them. This includes providing clear guidance and support for both applicants and wedding planners, as well as investing in robust verification systems to prevent fraudulent activity. The Home Office will also need to carefully monitor the impact of the new policy over time, making adjustments as necessary based on feedback from stakeholders and data analysis.

Overall, the introduction of Home Office approval for non-EU citizen marriages represents a major step forward in efforts to combat sham marriages and promote genuine partnerships in the UK. While there may be some short-term challenges associated with implementing the new policy, in the long run it will likely prove beneficial not just for individuals, but for the broader community as well.

Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries. Human rights groups, top police officers, and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.

The debate over the use of phone-tapped evidence in court continues as the UK government prepares to introduce new legislation on surveillance powers. Javier Solana has spoken out in support of using this type of evidence in criminal proceedings, stating that it is a common practice in Europe and can be used to prosecute criminals successfully. He believes that if the UK adopts these measures, they will help fight crime more effectively and improve security for citizens.

However, critics argue that allowing such evidence would infringe upon people's privacy and civil liberties. Many human rights organizations have called for greater safeguards to protect individuals from unlawful surveillance and misuse of information obtained through wiretaps. They also point out that there are cases where innocent people have been wrongly accused due to errors or biases in interpreting taped conversations.

Top police officers have also expressed their concerns over the potential consequences of relying too heavily on phone-tapped evidence in court. While it may provide important leads, they believe that other forms of investigation should not be overlooked, as they can lead to breakthroughs in complex cases that might otherwise go unsolved. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of ensuring that any evidence collected is admissible under legal rules and procedures.

Many members of parliament share similar views, calling for a balance between national security interests and individual freedoms. Some argue that while it is essential to combat terrorist activity, the right to privacy must be upheld at all times. Others contend that law enforcement agencies require adequate tools and resources to prevent crimes from happening, but these should always be subject to oversight and accountability mechanisms.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate surrounding the use of phone-tapped evidence in court highlights the complex relationship between national security and individual rights. As the UK considers introducing new legislation on surveillance powers, it is crucial to strike a careful balance between protecting public safety and maintaining the rule of law. Ultimately, any decision made by policymakers must take into account the needs and concerns of various stakeholders, including human rights groups, law enforcement officials, and the general public.",mistral7b,1

1) Theresa May has announced that she will not negotiate any further Brexit deal with Brussels until MPs vote on her withdrawal agreement. ""You don't do deals over jobs like this,"" the prime minister told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. This move comes as the UK is facing increasing pressure from both sides of the divide, with many Tories demanding a harder line against the EU and Labour MPs calling for a softer approach. The Prime Minister's stance has been widely praised by anti-Brexit campaigners, who see it as a sign that the UK will not compromise its position.

The decision marks a major shift in the country's approach to the negotiations, as the government had previously expressed willingness to consider making concessions to win the support of Brussels. However, May's statement makes it clear that no further talks will take place until parliament approves her withdrawal deal. The move is likely to anger EU leaders, who have already accused the UK of breaking promises made during the negotiations process. Despite this, May remains resolute in her position, arguing that the UK must maintain its sovereignty and independence at all costs.

2) A new biography of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has revealed that he reneged on his promise to step down after a leadership challenge in 2005. According to the book, which was written by journalist Andrew Marr, Blair went back on his word because of interventions by senior members of his cabinet. In June 2004, Blair had agreed to hand over power to Gordon Brown, who had been seen as his natural successor. However, when several key figures close to the Prime Minister voiced their opposition to Brown's imminent ascension, Blair decided to keep his post.

Marr argues that Blair's actions were driven by a desire to preserve his legacy and secure his own future. He notes that the Prime Minister had become increasingly isolated within the party, with several high-profile resignations and defeats undermining his authority. By keeping his job, Blair was able to continue shaping policy and maintaining control over his party, rather than leaving it in the hands of someone else. The revelation has prompted widespread criticism of Blair's tenure, with many accusing him of putting personal ambition above national interest.

3) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced calls to intervene in a controversial pipeline project following the resignation of indigenous protesters. Indigenous groups in British Columbia have been fighting against the construction of the Kinder Morgan pipeline, which would carry bitumen oil through their ancestral lands. The protests have resulted in significant delays and cost overruns, prompting calls from some politicians and business leaders for federal intervention. However, Trudeau has refused to intervene, saying that the project should be left to the province and local communities to decide.

Trudeau's decision has sparked controversy, with critics accusing him of betraying his commitment to reconcile with indigenous people. During the 2015 election, Trudeau ran on a platform of promoting environmental protections and respecting indigenous rights. However, opponents argue that his failure to intervene in the pipeline dispute shows that these commitments are not being taken seriously enough. Trudeau has defended his stance, saying that the federal government has played an active role in mediating talks between the parties involved and working towards finding a mutually beneficial solution.

4) President Donald Trump has come under fire for his handling of the ongoing crisis in Syria. Following the recent chemical attack on civilians in the rebel-held city of Douma, the United States launched a series of missiles at Syrian targets in response. However, the strikes have been criticized by experts and political commentators alike, with many warning that they could lead to a wider conflict and increased suffering for innocent civilians. Critics argue that the strikes are ill-timed and ill-advised, given that Russia is currently engaged in diplomatic efforts aimed",mistral7b,1

Politics: Cathy Jamieson on Exclusion Orders to Tackle Sectarianism

In an effort to combat sectarianism, the Scottish Executive is considering several measures, including exclusion orders. This was revealed by Minister for Communities and Equal Opportunities Cathy Jamieson during a speech at the Scottish Parliament yesterday. Jamieson praised Celtic and Rangers football clubs for their efforts in addressing this issue.

Jamieson stated that the Scottish Government will continue to work closely with local communities to find effective solutions to sectarianism, which has become increasingly prevalent in Scotland over recent years. The government's aim is to create a more inclusive society where people can live together without fear or prejudice based on religious beliefs.

""We cannot allow sectarianism to continue to divide our communities,"" Jamieson said. ""It is time for us to come together as Scots and put aside any differences that may exist between us. We must all work together to build a brighter future for ourselves and our children.""

Exclusion orders could be used under specific circumstances, such as when individuals engage in violent behavior or threaten the safety of others due to their religious affiliations. These orders would require individuals who pose such risks to be excluded from certain areas or events, preventing them from causing harm to others.

Jamieson also highlighted the important role that football clubs can play in combating sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers have been commended for their initiatives in addressing this issue. For example, both teams have established programs aimed at teaching youngsters about respect and tolerance, and they have also worked with community organizations to promote peace and unity among fans.

""I am grateful for the support of football clubs like Celtic and Rangers,"" Jamieson added. ""Their commitment to tackling sectarianism sets an excellent example for others to follow. Together, we can make a difference and create a better Scotland for everyone.""

While many agree that action needs to be taken to address sectarianism, there are concerns that exclusion orders may not go far enough in tackling the root causes of the problem. Some argue that it is essential to address issues related to poverty, inequality, and education if we want to see lasting change.

However, Jamieson remains optimistic about the potential for positive change. ""We know that it won't be easy, but I believe that we can overcome this challenge,"" she said. ""By working together and showing a united front, we can make Scotland a safer and more harmonious place for everyone.""

As the debate continues about how best to tackle sectarianism in Scotland, it is clear that the fight is far from over. However, with the continued support of groups like Celtic and Rangers, and the dedication of politicians and citizens alike, progress can be made towards creating a more inclusive and peaceful society.",mistral7b,1

Title: Immigration Policy Proposed By Clarke To Avoid Quota System Planned By Tories

In recent years, the topic of immigration has become increasingly controversial in the UK, with many arguing that there needs to be stricter controls on who can come into the country. This week, former Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke announced that he was planning to propose a new immigration policy that aimed to strike a balance between welcoming economic migrants and ensuring security.

One of the key elements of Clarke's proposed plan is a points-based system, similar to the one used in Australia. Under this scheme, immigrants would earn points based on their skills, qualifications, and work experience, which could then be redeemed for visas. However, unlike Australia's system which includes quotas, Clarke wants to ensure that everyone has an equal chance at obtaining a visa regardless of where they are from or how long they have been waiting.

Clarke explained his reasoning behind his proposal, saying, ""Economic migration is beneficial to our society and our economy, but it also needs careful regulation and proper policing to ensure we maintain control over who comes here."" He went on to argue that the current system, which relies heavily on family reunions and humanitarian cases, leaves little room for those with valuable skills to contribute to the UK.

His comments were echoed by other politicians, including Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who welcomed his proposal. She said, ""Kenneth Clarke's plan represents a sensible approach to immigration that balances the need for skilled workers with the desire to protect our borders.""

However, not everyone is happy with Clarke's proposals. Some Conservatives have accused him of being too soft on immigration and failing to take seriously their promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands. They pointed out that the points-based system alone does nothing to limit the number of people coming into the country, and that additional measures such as caps on certain types of visas are needed to achieve their goal.

Despite these criticisms, Clarke remains confident in his proposal. He believes that a well-designed points-based system, coupled with increased cooperation with other countries to tackle illegal immigration, will provide a more effective way of managing immigration than the current system.

As he prepares to unveil his plans next week, Clarke knows that he will face significant opposition from both sides of the political divide. But he is determined to make the case for a balanced approach to immigration that puts the interests of the UK first while still welcoming those who want to come here and contribute to our society.

Overall, the debate surrounding immigration continues to be a contentious issue in the UK. While there may never be a consensus on the best way to manage it, Clarke's proposal represents an important step towards finding a solution that works for everyone. As he sets out his vision for the future of immigration, it remains to",mistral7b,1

The proposed constitutional change has sparked fierce debate among Britons, with a recent poll revealing differing opinions on the matter. According to The Daily Telegraph poll, a majority of 45% of those surveyed said they would vote against the new constitution, while only 24% were in favour. This indicates that many people are opposed to the changes being made to their country's legal framework.

However, it appears that there is some uncertainty surrounding the final decision on this issue. A separate poll by YouGov found that 25% of respondents did not know how they would vote if forced to make a choice tomorrow. This suggests that a significant portion of the population may still be weighing their options before making a definitive stance.

As the deadline for the referendum approaches, politicians from all sides have continued to campaign for their respective positions. Supporters of the new constitution argue that it will bring greater stability and certainty to the UK's political system, while opponents worry that it could lead to unforeseen consequences.

With such a close split between those who support and oppose the constitutional change, it seems likely that the outcome of the referendum will be determined by a small margin of votes. It remains to be seen whether the public will ultimately choose to embrace the changes or reject them outright.",mistral7b,1

1) In an interview with Channel Five's The Wright Stuff programme, he spoke out against voting for the Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems), stating that their policies often lack transparency and authenticity. ""What you see is what you get with the Lib Dems,"" he remarked. ""If they say one thing today, it could be completely different tomorrow. I urge people to think carefully before casting their vote, because backing your party can make all the difference."" His comments sparked heated debate among viewers, who expressed varying degrees of agreement and disagreement with his views. Some praised him for speaking truthfully while others accused him of being biased and divisive. Nonetheless, the discussion highlighted the importance of informed decision-making when it comes to political elections.
2) During his appearance on The Wright Stuff, he also addressed issues such as immigration reform and healthcare policy, expressing his strong support for stricter border control measures and improved access to medical care. He argued that these areas require immediate attention from policymakers, noting that they are crucial factors in ensuring public safety and wellbeing. Additionally, he emphasized the need for greater accountability in government and more open dialogue between politicians and citizens alike, stressing that only through collaboration and mutual respect can meaningful progress be achieved. While his ideas may have divided some listeners, there were many who appreciated his candidness and willingness to address complex issues head-on.
3) Another key topic discussed by our interviewee during his visit to The Wright Stuff was Brexit and its impact on the UK economy. He acknowledged that the issue has been subject to much speculation and uncertainty, but insisted that it is essential that businesses prepare for potential changes in trade agreements and regulatory frameworks. Moreover, he advocated for a cautious approach to negotiations, warning that hasty decisions could jeopardize the country's economic stability and competitiveness. Despite facing criticism from some quarters for his stance on this matter, he remained steadfast in his belief that careful planning and diplomatic engagement are necessary to ensure a smooth transition.
4) Aside from discussing current affairs, our interviewee took the opportunity to share insights into his own career trajectory and experiences working within the political sphere. He reflected on the challenges he faced early on in his career and how these helped shape his worldview and values as a politician. He also offered advice for aspiring politicians, encouraging them to stay true to their principles and remain committed to serving their constituents above all else.

The British government has been rocked by allegations that former Prime Minister Tony Blair lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Meanwhile, Chancellor George Osborne continues his work to improve the UK's economic prospects. He announced plans for tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure during his recent Budget speech. The move was welcomed by many as a way to boost economic growth and create jobs.

However, the political landscape remains uncertain. The opposition Labour party has yet to fully recover from its defeat in the last general election. Leader Ed Miliband has faced criticism over his leadership style and has struggled to gain public support. Despite this, the Conservative party remains unpopular among many voters due to ongoing austerity measures. This has led to calls for an alternative political movement that could challenge the traditional two-party system.

Meanwhile, the chancellor is leaving Britain on a high-profit tour of Africa to highlight poverty issues. Before heading off, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. This statement has sparked debate, with some arguing that it undermines the seriousness of the current situation. Others believe that it shows loyalty to a man who served as prime minister for over ten years.

Despite these challenges, there are signs that the UK economy may be turning a corner. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly over the past year, while wages have started to rise slightly. However, concerns remain about the impact of austerity measures and the potential for another recession in the near future.

As the country prepares for the next general election, political leaders will need to focus on addressing key issues such as healthcare, education, and the environment. These topics are likely to feature prominently in campaign manifestos, with parties seeking to appeal to different demographics and win over undecided voters.

In the meantime, the chancellor will continue his efforts to improve the UK's economic performance. He believes that by cutting taxes and investing in infrastructure, the UK can become more competitive and attractive to businesses. However, this approach is controversial among some, who argue that it benefits only the wealthy and does little to help those who are struggling to make ends meet.

Overall, the political landscape in the UK remains complex and uncertain. While there are signs of progress on certain fronts, there are also significant challenges facing the country. As such, political leaders will need to work hard to address these issues and convince voters that they have their best interests at heart.",mistral7b,1

The new immigration bill is set for its first parliamentary hearing tomorrow, but already it looks like it will face fierce opposition from both sides of the House. Up to 30 Labour MPs could oppose the scheme during a Commons debate, while Tories have called for more time to consider its implications. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has rejected calls to ""pause"" on the bill, insisting that the country needs the changes as soon as possible.

Labour MPs are concerned that the bill will lead to increased discrimination against immigrants and could harm their ability to attract talent from abroad. They also fear that it could exacerbate social tensions between different communities and create further divisions within the party itself. The government's own backbenchers have raised similar concerns, prompting the prime minister to call a special meeting last week to discuss ways to reassure MPs and win support for the bill.

Despite this, many Conservatives believe that the bill goes too far and would result in too much bureaucracy and red tape. Some have even suggested that it could be counterproductive if it leads to a shortage of workers and undermines Britain's economic growth. The Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, has been particularly critical of the bill, arguing that it is an ill-thought-out piece of legislation that risks damaging the UK's reputation as a welcoming nation.

However, the home secretary remains steadfast in his support for the bill, insisting that the country cannot afford to wait any longer to address the challenges posed by immigration. He believes that the current system is unsustainable and that reform is needed to maintain public confidence and ensure national security. In an interview yesterday, he said: ""We can't just keep going down the same road without tackling these issues head on.""

As the debate gets underway tomorrow, there are likely to be many twists and turns ahead. It remains to be seen whether the government will be able to win over enough MPs to pass the bill or whether it will become embroiled in another bitter row over immigration policy. Whatever happens, one thing is clear: the issue of immigration will continue to dominate political discussions in the coming months and years.",mistral7b,1

Politicians are often under attack for their campaigns and actions. In this case, prospective Tory candidate Andrew Mennear has been criticized for his use of an anti-Semitic poster that has caused widespread outrage among many people. The poster depicts him and another man, both wearing masks, standing beside each other while holding signs saying ""The day the Tory sums add up"". It was placed outside a polling station during last week's local elections, causing anger and frustration among voters who were appalled by its message.

According to reports, Mr. Mennear had previously denied any involvement in the creation or distribution of the poster, but he later admitted that he did not condone it. He apologized profusely for any offense that might have been caused, stating that he would never again allow such material to be used in connection with his campaign. However, critics continue to question whether he is truly sorry for what happened, given the fact that he initially defended the poster as being within legal limits.

This incident has sparked a wider debate about political advertising and how far politicians should go to get their messages across. While there is no denying that posters can be effective in swaying public opinion, many argue that they can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and inflame tensions between different groups of people. As such, there is increasing pressure on politicians to be more mindful of the language and imagery they use in their campaigns, in order to avoid offending anyone unnecessarily.

Despite the controversy surrounding the poster, it is clear that Mr. Mennear remains committed to running for office in the future. Whether he will succeed depends largely on how well he navigates these tricky waters and learns from past mistakes. Only time will tell whether he will emerge victorious or fall victim to the same pitfalls that so many others have before him.",mistral7b,1

British forces have suffered another legal blow over their role in Iraq, as a high court ruling found that the death of Baha Moussa, a detainee who died after being beaten and tortured while in UK custody, was unlawful under international human rights law. The decision marks the first time that a civilian court has held British soldiers accountable for torture committed abroad.

The case brought by Mr. Moussa's family focused on allegations that he was subjected to ill-treatment during his capture and transfer from Basra province to Camp Bastion, where he later died from multiple injuries sustained during a beating frenzy. It had long been known that the UK government failed to properly investigate Mr. Moussa's death and did not take sufficient steps to hold those responsible accountable.

However, in a landmark ruling, three senior judges at London's Appeal Court said that the treatment inflicted upon Mr. Moussa amounted to a violation of his right to life under article two of the European Convention on Human Rights. They also ruled that the actions of the British military were in breach of the duty of care owed to Mr. Moussa under domestic law, which requires public authorities to ensure that they do not cause harm to individuals through negligence or omission.

In addition, the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Moussa's death, stating that previous investigations carried out by the UK government and US military officials were inadequate and lacked credibility. This will be seen as a victory by the family of Mr. Moussa, who have spent years campaigning for justice for their loved one's death and mistreatment.

This latest setback for British forces comes amid growing concerns about the UK's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, where hundreds of civilians have died due to coalition operations. As such, there is likely to be increasing pressure on the UK government to address these issues and bring those responsible to justice, both domestically and internationally.

It remains to be seen whether this high court ruling will lead to further action against those involved in the death of Baha Moussa and other victims of British military brutality overseas. However, it sends a clear message that the courts will no longer tolerate abuses of power by public authorities and will hold them accountable for any wrongdoing that takes place.

In conclusion, the recent high court ruling represents a significant step towards holding the UK military accountable for its actions during its time in Iraq. The judges made it clear that the treatment inflicted on Baha Moussa was unacceptable, and that the UK government must take immediate action to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. While the road ahead may still be fraught with challenges, this ruling provides a glimmer of hope that justice can ultimately be served for all those whose lives have been lost or destroyed because of Britain's involvement in this tragic conflict.",mistral7b,1

Answer: In recent years, there has been growing concern about the laws surrounding self-defense, particularly when it comes to using weapons. Some argue that current laws are too permissive, allowing people to use deadly force without consequence. Others argue that they go too far, restricting individuals' ability to defend themselves or their loved ones.

One such issue is the legality of using ""something to hand"" as a weapon. According to the National Institute of Justice, this phrase refers to any object that can be used as a means of defense, including things like sticks, rocks, or even books. While these objects may not seem threatening at first glance, many have been used as weapons in violent confrontations.

In an effort to clarify the laws surrounding self-defense and the use of objects as weapons, police and prosecutors in several states have released leaflets detailing what constitutes reasonable force under current legislation. These leaflets aim to combat confusion among the public and provide guidance on how to navigate the legal system if you find yourself in a situation where you feel threatened or unsafe.

According to the National Institute of Justice, ""reasonable force"" is defined as the amount of force necessary to prevent or stop harm to another person. This includes both physical and verbal threats. However, whether or not force is considered reasonable depends on a number of factors, including the size, strength, and age of the parties involved, as well as the nature of the threat posed.

It's important to note that while the law allows for the use of reasonable force in self-defense, it does not give individuals free rein to use violence whenever they please. For example, if someone uses excessive force or retaliates against an attacker after the danger has passed, they could face criminal charges. Similarly, if someone uses a prohibited weapon, such as a firearm, they could also be charged with a crime.

Despite these restrictions, however, many people still believe that current laws go too far in restricting their right to defend themselves. They argue that the concept of ""reasonable force"" is too subjective, leaving room for interpretation and misinterpretation. Additionally, they point out that criminals often use weapons that are illegal to possess or carry, giving them an advantage over unarmed victims.

Others argue that current laws do not go far enough in protecting citizens from violent crimes. They contend that the use of lethal force should only be reserved for situations where all other options have failed and death is imminent. They also call for stricter penalties for individuals who use weapons in violent crimes, arguing that these measures would deter potential offenders and make communities safer.

Regardless of your stance on the laws surrounding self-defense and the use of weapons, one thing is clear: the topic remains highly controversial and contentious. As such, it's important to stay informed about current legislation and seek professional advice if you find yourself in a situation where you feel threatened or unsafe.",mistral7b,1

An ambitious new transparency law comes into force next month that will give citizens the right to access any information they want from a wide range of public bodies, including government departments and medical practices. Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), anyone can make a request for data, documents or records held by these organizations, without having to go through lengthy legal processes. However, an all-party committee warned today that the new legislation could lead to chaos if not properly implemented, as many organizations may not be ready to comply with its demands. The panel urged ministers to ensure that adequate training is provided to staff across all sectors, so that they are fully equipped to handle requests under the FOIA. The committee also called on the government to set up a centralized helpdesk to assist individuals who encounter difficulties when making requests, and to establish clear guidelines for how organizations should respond to such queries. Despite these concerns, however, the committee welcomed the introduction of the FOIA, which it described as a major step towards greater accountability and openness in government. It added: ""We believe this act has the potential to revolutionize the way we hold those in power to account."" With the FOIA now poised to take effect, campaigners are urging people to use their newfound powers to uncover information that might otherwise remain hidden from view. They hope that this will lead to more informed decision-making and better governance, as well as increased trust between citizens and their elected representatives. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, the introduction of the FOIA represents a significant milestone in the fight for greater transparency and democracy.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:
The UK government has announced ambitious new plans to improve public safety across the country. Under these plans, every neighbourhood will have its own dedicated policing team. In addition, businesses will be required to sign up to a ten-point charter that sets out their responsibilities when it comes to crime prevention and community engagement. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was determined to make sure that people felt safe and secure wherever they lived or worked.
""We've heard time and again that people want to see more officers on their streets,"" Ms Patel said. ""And we are delivering. These dedicated teams will give communities the support they need to tackle crime head-on."" She added that the government was also working closely with local councils to develop partnerships that went beyond just traditional law enforcement. ""It's not just about stopping criminals - we need to work together to build strong, resilient communities that can stand against any kind of threat,"" she said.
Article 2:
Local leaders have welcomed the announcement of new measures aimed at reducing crime levels in the area. Councillor Jane Smith, who represents the town hall ward where the plans were unveiled, said she hoped they would help to address the concerns raised by residents. ""For too long now, our communities have been plagued by crime and antisocial behaviour,"" she said. ""But this is going to change under these new initiatives.""
She added that she was particularly pleased to hear about the commitment to establishing a 10-point charter for business owners. ""This will really help us to build stronger relationships between local businesses and residents,"" she said. ""By working together, we can create safer and more vibrant communities that attract visitors and investors alike."" Councillor John Doe, who represents a nearby ward, agreed. ""These plans show that the government is taking our concerns seriously and that they are willing to listen to what we have to say,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to seeing the positive impact these measures will have on our community.""
Article 3:
Police chiefs across the country have expressed their excitement over the new proposals. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Simpson, who leads the national policing strategy for the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), said he believed that the creation of dedicated neighbourhood teams was a key step towards improving public confidence in the police force. ""People want to feel that there is someone they can turn to if they are worried about crime,"" he said. ""With these new teams in place, I am confident that we can deliver that sense of reassurance to our communities.""
Simpson added that he was equally supportive of the proposed charter for businesses. ""Crime doesn't happen in isolation - it often requires collaboration between different organisations to stop,"" he said. ""So I welcome the idea of creating a shared responsibility between businesses and the police in preventing crime and keeping our communities safe."" He concluded by thanking the government for its commitment to tackling crime and building safer communities.
Article 4:
Civil liberties campaigners have warned that the new plans could lead to increased surveillance and erosion of civil liberties. Dr Sharon McGregor, director of Liberty, said that while she supported efforts to combat crime, any measure that involves increased state surveillance must be carefully considered. ""There needs to be a balance between protecting people from harm and respecting their right to privacy,"" she said. ""Any move towards greater surveillance risks crossing that line and becoming an attack on fundamental rights.""
Dr McGregor added that she had grave reservations about the effectiveness of the proposed charter for businesses. ""While well intentioned, such schemes risk turning businesses into extensions of the police force,"" she said. ""Businesses should focus on providing goods and services, not acting as surrogate enforcers."" She called on the government to reconsider its approach and find ways to reduce crime that do not involve further infringement upon citizens' liberties.",mistral7b,1

The political landscape of the UK is constantly changing, but one figure who has remained a fixture for over two decades is Peter Mandelson. One of the few Blair-era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997. However, it wasn't long before he became Tony Blair's ""cabinet enforcer,"" tasked with delivering tough decisions and keeping the party on track.

Over his career, Mandelson has been at the center of several high-profile scandals. In 2005, he was accused of offering bribes to journalists in exchange for favorable coverage. He denied any wrongdoing, but eventually stepped down as secretary of state for business after an investigation into his behavior. Despite this setback, Mandelson continued to be a key figure in Blair's government until the prime minister resigned in 2007.

In recent years, Mandelson has kept a low profile while focusing on his work with venture capital firm Lazard and writing a memoir detailing his time in Blair's cabinet. While many may view him as controversial, there's no denying that Mandelson played a critical role in shaping British politics during his time in office.",mistral7b,1

Veritas leader says immigration is only good for businesses, elites
--------------------------------------------------------------

The leader of Veritas has sparked controversy by claiming that immigration benefits only a select few groups. According to the Veritas leader, employers and landlords are the main beneficiaries of immigration from countries such as Poland. He also argued that the metropolitan elite stands to gain the most from the influx of new residents.

""The only people to benefit from immigrants from places like Poland are employers, landlords, members of the 'metropolitan elite',"" he said. ""They may have come here seeking better opportunities or higher wages, but in reality, they're just filling gaps left behind by other migrants who can't find work.""

Meanwhile, MEPs from various political parties have criticized these remarks, saying that it ignores the many contributions made by immigrants. They argue that immigrants bring valuable skills and knowledge that can benefit society as a whole. In response, the Veratis leader reiterated his stance, stating that only those with specific skills will be allowed into the country.

Veritas leader calls for stricter immigration laws
--------------------------------------------------

The Veritas leader has called for stricter immigration laws after recent criticism of his views on immigration. He believes that the current system is too lenient, allowing anyone to enter the country without proper vetting or qualifications. As a result, he wants to limit the number of immigrants admitted each year and ensure that those who do arrive are highly skilled and able to contribute positively to society.",mistral7b,1

Scottish regiment supporters to launch election bid against Defence Secretary

The Save the Scottish Regiments group has announced that it will stand a candidate against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in East Kilbride during next month's general election.

Hoon's decision to merge the Scottish and English regiments sparked widespread anger among serving personnel who fear their jobs would be lost as a result of the changes.

""We believe this is a disgraceful attack on our soldiers,"" said John McTaggart, chairman of the Save the Scottish Regiments campaign.

""These men have fought bravely for years and now they are being thrown out without any consideration whatsoever for their welfare or families. We cannot let Mr Hoon get away with such an appalling act.""

McTaggart added: ""It is time for us to take action and fight back against those responsible for these cuts. That is why we have decided to stand a candidate in East Kilbride.""

The move marks a new stage in the campaign against the proposed mergers, which were first announced last year and face fierce opposition from military families across Scotland.

The group, which is unhappy at the mergers, was initially planning to endorse Labour candidates but has since decided to throw its support behind opposition parties instead.

In total, the Save the Scottish Regiments group will be backing opposition candidates in nine Scottish constituencies where there is a strong likelihood of defeating incumbents from the ruling party.",mistral7b,1

A: New measures have been implemented across England and Wales as part of a controversial policy aimed at increasing police powers. The move was met with criticism from various stakeholders, including trade unions representing officers.
On Thursday, it was announced that the Community Support Officer (CSO) scheme would be expanded nationwide. Previously only available in selected areas, the initiative will now see CSOs deployed in every police force across England and Wales. This decision has sparked concerns among many, particularly those who worry that these individuals may lack the necessary training and expertise to handle potentially dangerous or confrontational scenarios.
In response to this development, the Police Federation of England and Wales issued a statement expressing its dismay with the government's choice. According to the federation, which represents over 130,000 police officers, there are serious risks associated with deploying non-police personnel into high-risk environments. Specifically, they argue that CSOs do not have the same level of training and experience as regular police officers, and therefore cannot guarantee public safety.
The federation also raised concerns about the potential for confusion when it comes to identifying who is responsible for maintaining law and order. With more than 17,000 CSOs set to join the ranks, there could well be instances where members of the public become uncertain about who exactly they should approach if they need help. This could ultimately lead to decreased trust in the police service and increased feelings of vulnerability for those living in communities where CSOs operate.
Despite these warnings, however, the UK government remains steadfast in its determination to introduce the CSO program nationwide. In recent years, there have been several incidents involving CSOs, leading critics to question their ability to effectively perform duties typically reserved for police officers. Nevertheless, proponents of the program argue that it can help reduce costs by freeing up police resources to focus on other tasks.
As the debate rages on, it seems likely that we will continue to hear mixed opinions about the value of the CSO program. While some believe it is an important step forward in modernizing the way our law enforcement operates, others remain skeptical about whether such changes are truly justified. Only time will tell whether this new measure will prove successful or not.",mistral7b,1

1. Amid growing concern over the integrity of sports, a UK parliamentary committee launched an extensive investigation into betting practices last year. This came after reports suggested that the rise in online and mobile betting had facilitated increased cheating among players, leading to calls for greater regulation in the industry.
2. The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming, which is responsible for monitoring gambling-related issues in the UK, conducted a thorough examination of the betting landscape. The group's findings revealed that while the rise in digital betting has created new opportunities for consumers, it has also raised concerns over the safety and security of online transactions.
3. One area of particular focus was the potential for fraudulent activity within the betting industry. With so much money changing hands through digital platforms, there are legitimate worries that criminals could exploit vulnerabilities in order to defraud unsuspecting bettors.
4. Another issue identified by the committee was the need for greater transparency in pricing and odds. Consumers have expressed frustration at what they perceive to be unfair advantages being given to bookmakers, which can make it difficult for them to win their bets.
5. In response to these concerns, the committee has called on gambling operators to work closely with regulators to develop clearer guidelines and standards for pricing and advertising. They have also urged operators to take steps to improve customer protection and prevent fraudulent activity.
6. While the debate over gambling continues, there is no denying its popularity in the UK. Millions of people enjoy placing bets on a range of sports and activities, from football to horse racing to casino games. However, this popularity comes with responsibility, and it is up to both gamblers and operators to ensure that they are operating ethically and transparently.
7. Ultimately, the goal of the committee's inquiry was to promote safer and fairer gambling practices in the UK. By working together, stakeholders across the industry can help to create an environment where everyone feels confident that they are getting a fair deal, and where any problems or abuses can be quickly detected and addressed.",mistral7b,1

Politics: Pro-Life MP Says Science Is Not Always Best

In the midst of ongoing debates on embryonic research and stem cell use, pro-life MP Sarah Kelly has expressed her opposition to scientific advancements in this area. According to reports, Ms Kelly, who is Catholic, is known for her strong stance against embryo research and believes that science should not always be the final word in such matters. Her comments have sparked controversy among those advocating for the right to use human embryos for scientific purposes.

Medical researchers have criticized Ms Kelly's position, arguing that it could stifle important progress in medicine and biotechnology. However, others argue that her views are necessary to ensure ethical considerations are taken into account when conducting experiments involving human life. The issue remains highly polarized, with no clear consensus emerging on either side.

As a member of parliament representing an electorate with a diverse range of opinions, Ms Kelly's views may be seen as divisive by many. But according to Professor Nancy Rothwell, director of the University College London (UCL) Centre for Human Embryogenesis and Developmental Medicine, Ms Kelly's stance matters because she is responsible for training future scientists.

Professor Rothwell explained that while there may be disagreements over whether or not embryonic research should be allowed, it is crucial that scientists are trained with a deep understanding of both sides of the argument. ""We need to train our scientists so they can make informed decisions about the implications of their work,"" she said. ""It is essential that they understand the ethical considerations involved and how these might impact society.""

The UCL Centre for Human Embryogenesis and Developmental Medicine focuses on understanding the development of the earliest stages of human life and its implications for disease prevention and treatment. While Ms Kelly's opposition to embryo research may seem at odds with this mission, Professor Rothwell believes it can actually help foster healthy debate within the field.

""There will always be different viewpoints on issues like embryonic research and stem cells,"" she said. ""But what we hope to achieve through our work is to encourage dialogue between those who hold opposing positions. By doing so, we can develop new treatments that benefit everyone, regardless of their beliefs.""

Despite the ongoing debate surrounding Ms Kelly's stance on embryonic research and stem cells, there is no denying that her views carry significant weight given her role as a politician and trainer of future scientists. As such, it is crucial that any criticism of her position is balanced and respectful of her responsibilities in both areas.",mistral7b,1

Army Reorganisation Plans Unveiled by Defence Leaders
----------------------------------------------

The Ministry of Defence has announced that it will be restructuring its Scottish regiments, with cuts planned to bring down the number of units from six to five. This move comes as part of a wider review of military structures across the UK, aimed at making the armed forces more effective and efficient.

According to sources within the Ministry, the decision was taken after much consideration and consultation with key stakeholders, including members of the Armed Forces community in Scotland. It is expected that the changes will take place over several years, with new arrangements gradually being put in place as existing ones are phased out.

One of the main concerns raised during the consultation process was the impact that such changes could have on morale among troops serving in Scotland. However, the MoD insisted that any transition period would be carefully managed, with support provided to all affected personnel.

""We understand that this may be difficult news for those who serve in our regiments,"" said a spokesperson for the ministry. ""However, we believe that these changes will ultimately make us a stronger and more capable force, able to deliver better results for Britain and its allies.""

In addition to reducing the number of regiments, the proposed reforms also include plans to merge some of the remaining units into what will be known as a 'super regiment'. This move is intended to create greater efficiency and reduce duplication of resources, while maintaining the high levels of expertise and professionalism required to carry out the army's various tasks.

It is not yet clear how many soldiers will be affected by these changes, although it is thought that thousands of personnel will be directly or indirectly impacted. The Ministry has promised to provide further details on these issues once the full extent of the restructuring becomes clearer.

Some critics have questioned whether cutting the number of regiments is really necessary, given the ongoing threats facing the country. They argue that such moves risk undermining public confidence in the army and sending the wrong message to potential adversaries abroad.

""This kind of short-sighted cost-cutting could seriously harm our national security interests,"" said one former soldier who served in Scotland. ""At a time when we face growing threats from terrorists and other hostile actors, you can bet your bottom dollar that they won't be taking their foot off the accelerator just because we decide to cut our defences.""

Despite these concerns, however, the government appears resolute in pursuing its restructuring plans. With a major review of military spending set to begin in the coming months, the army will need to adapt to changing circumstances if it is to remain an effective fighting force in the future.

Meanwhile, the Committee of the Army Board - which includes some of the most senior defence figures in the country - will gather on Monday to discuss these proposals in detail. If approved, the changes would represent one of the biggest shakeups of the army since World War II.",mistral7b,1

The politician had been dating a high-profile celebrity for several months when their relationship took a turn for the worse. I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public with our relationship, causing tension within the political sphere. The situation worsened during the summer months as rumours circulated about infidelities on both sides.

Things came to a head when the tabloid newspaper, News of the World, picked up the story and published a series of explosive revelations about the couple's relationship. The fallout was swift and brutal, with many politicians calling for the politician to step down from office.

Despite this, the politician remained steadfast in their efforts to salvage the relationship. They tried for three years to make something work, but ultimately failed to win back the trust of those close to them. As a result, the politician's career was effectively destroyed by the scandal.

In the aftermath of the crisis, many commentators questioned how such a prominent figure could have let themselves get caught up in such a messy situation.

The decision comes as a disappointment to many who were hoping to see a face-off between the incumbent prime minister and his rivals, particularly after Tory leader Michael Howard called on him to do so earlier in the month.

At his monthly press conference, Blair reiterated his stance against debates, citing the same reasons that he has been giving since the beginning of his tenure as PM. ""We answer this question every single election campaign,"" he said, ""and, for the reasons that I have given before, the answer remains the same - no.""

Politics and Lobbying: A Match Made in Heaven?

In any democratic society, it is essential for citizens to have a say in how they are governed. This is where political parties come into play, as they represent different views and ideals that the population can vote for or against. However, not all voices are equal when it comes to shaping government policies. That's where lobbyists step in.

Lobbyists are professionals who work behind the scenes to influence politicians and policymakers on behalf of specific interest groups. They often use persuasive tactics such as advertising campaigns, public demonstrations, and meetings with elected officials to sway opinion in their favor. While some may see this type of activity as undemocratic, others view it as a necessary part of a healthy democracy. Regardless of your stance on the issue, there is no denying that lobbying plays an integral role in shaping our governments.

One group that has long been active in the world of politics is environmental organizations. With so much at stake when it comes to protecting our planet, these groups are dedicated to making sure that their concerns are heard by those in power. According to one environmental advocate, ""A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. It's an opportunity for us to speak directly to voters and explain why we care so deeply about these issues."" With an upcoming spring poll just around the corner, environmentalists will be working hard to ensure that their message gets out to potential voters.

Another important factor to consider when discussing lobbying is healthcare. Healthcare reform has been a hot topic for years now, with many people advocating for changes to the current system. For those who support universal healthcare, the stakes couldn't be higher. One activist stated, ""Healthcare is something that affects everyone, regardless of age or socioeconomic status. If we want to build a better future for ourselves and generations to come, we need to prioritize access to quality medical care for all."" To achieve this goal, healthcare advocates are using every tool available to them to spread awareness and rally support from both the public and policymakers.

While environmental and healthcare organizations are two of the more well-known examples of lobbying groups, there are countless other organizations working tirelessly to shape government policy. From labor unions to civil rights groups, each organization has its own unique perspective on the issues that matter most. When asked what motivates him to work as a lobbyist, one representative explained, ""I do it because I believe strongly in my cause. Whether it's fighting for workers' rights or promoting social justice, I know that my voice matters and can help bring about change."" In order to succeed, however, these groups must be strategic in their approach to influencing public opinion and securing funding for their initiatives.

Aside from direct lobbying efforts, political action committees (PACs) also play a crucial role in shaping government policy. PACs are essentially fundraising entities that pool together money from individuals and corporations in order to support specific candidates or causes. By contributing large sums of money to political campaigns, PACs can help swing elections in favor of candidates who align closely with their goals. While this method of political influence may seem like an underhanded tactic to some, proponents argue that it allows for greater transparency and accountability in the political process. As one analyst put it, ""By giving money upfront, PACs force candidates to clearly articulate their positions and show that they have enough support to win over voters.""

Despite their efforts, however, not all lobbying efforts are successful. Some groups simply don't have the resources or clout to effectively sway public opinion, while others may face opposition from powerful interests that disagree with their agenda. In cases like these, lobbyists must resort to more creative strategies in order to achieve their objectives. For example, some groups may choose to engage in grassroots organizing efforts, encouraging ordinary citizens to contact their elected representatives and express their support for certain policies. Others might try to generate buzz by releasing controversial reports or holding high-profile events designed to grab media attention. Ultimately, though, success depends on a variety of factors, including the strength of the argument, the level of public support, and the ability to secure key endorsements from influential figures.

When it comes to lobbying, timing is everything. With an election looming on the horizon, pressure groups know that they need to act fast if they hope to influence government policy before voters go to the ball",mistral7b,1

An article titled ""Blair-Brown Rift Escalates Over Global Aid Initiatives"" could be written:
In recent years, there have been rumors of a rift between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown over issues related to global aid and debt reduction. However, this latest alleged rift has taken on a new dimension, with both men vying for credit for the government's response to the devastating tsunami disaster that hit Asia last year.
The dispute has become increasingly heated, with sources close to both men suggesting that the two are engaged in a bitter struggle to outdo each other in their efforts to secure funding and support for the relief effort. This has caused tension within the Cabinet, with some members feeling caught in the middle of the debate.
According to reports, the rift started during a meeting between Blair and Brown to discuss the allocation of funds for the tsunami relief effort. The source said that while Blair wanted the lion's share of the money to go towards Britain's own relief efforts, Brown argued strongly that more money should be sent abroad to help those affected by the disaster.
Despite attempts to downplay the situation, the dispute continued to dominate headlines throughout the week. During his monthly news conference, Blair was forced to address questions about his relationship with Brown, with many journalists eager to know whether the two were still on speaking terms.
However, the prime minister refused to comment directly on the matter, saying only that he and Brown were committed to working together to ensure that the country's resources were used effectively and efficiently in the face of the crisis. He also emphasized the importance of maintaining unity within the cabinet at this critical juncture.
Despite Blair's insistence that the rift was nothing more than a minor spat, it has raised serious concerns among many observers about the stability of the government. Some fear that if the two men cannot resolve their differences, it could lead to further divisions within the cabinet and even threaten the unity of the party itself.
Others argue that the disagreement is not necessarily a bad thing, as it can lead to greater accountability and transparency in the decision-making process. They point out that the public has a right to know how decisions are being made, especially when billions of pounds of taxpayer money are involved.
As the row continues to simmer beneath the surface, it remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome will be. Will Blair and Brown be able to put aside their differences and work together to meet the needs of those affected by the tsunami disaster? Or will the rift continue to widen, leading to further instability and division within the government?",mistral7b,1

1) Boris Johnson's decision to resign as Prime Minister has sparked a political storm, with many commentators questioning the timing of the move. But according to a new biography, the PM made up his mind after receiving advice from key advisors within the government. The book by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston claims that Johnson had been struggling to maintain control over his cabinet and was under pressure to step down. However, it is not yet clear who will replace him as leader.
2) As the world watches anxiously, tensions continue to rise between North Korea and South Korea, with both countries continuing their military exercises. Despite calls for peace talks, there are no signs of an imminent ceasefire. The situation remains highly volatile and dangerous. Meanwhile, leaders from around the globe have condemned the actions of North Korea, calling them provocative and irresponsible.
3) In the United States, President Joe Biden has signed a $40 billion bill aimed at strengthening American infrastructure.

Title: ""Brown's Deal With Blair Backfires""

The ongoing debate between Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former leader Tony Blair has taken a dramatic turn as revelations from a new biography claim that Brown had made a deal with his predecessor. The deal was supposedly made during the 2003 Iraq War, when Blair was facing growing opposition from his own cabinet members who were unhappy with his leadership style.

According to the biography, Brown promised Blair a seat at the top table of government if he stepped down as Prime Minister in exchange for his support. However, it appears that this promise was broken when Blair refused to step down despite repeated calls from his colleagues. Instead, Blair continued to lead the Labour Party until he resigned in 2007.

In an interview on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme, Brown denied any involvement in such a deal. He said, ""I can confirm categorically that I never entered into any discussions with Tony Blair or anyone else about making way for him."" When pressed by host Andrew Neil, Brown added, ""You don't do deals over jobs like this. It's just not something you would ever consider doing.""

However, sources close to the biography have confirmed that Blair did indeed agree to Brown's offer of a role in the government. They say that Blair saw himself as having a key part to play in shaping the future of the Labour Party.

This latest revelation comes amid increasing tensions between Blair and Brown. In recent months, the two men have been embroiled in a bitter row over their respective roles in the Iraq War. Blair has faced criticism for taking the UK into war without sufficient evidence, while Brown has been accused of failing to take responsibility for his decision-making during his time as Prime Minister.

As political commentators weigh in on the implications of these new revelations, there are concerns that the rift between the two men could further undermine public trust in the Labour party. Many people feel that the party is struggling to provide clear direction and vision, which may be exacerbated by infighting among its leaders.

Despite attempts to move on from the Iraq War, the conflict remains a major source of tension in British politics. Some critics argue that the country should have never gone to war, while others point to the need for military intervention in light of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. As the debate continues, it is likely that we will see more revelations emerge that shed light on the decisions made by both Blair and Brown.

One potential consequence of all this is that it may become harder for either man to maintain their popularity within the party. There is already speculation that Blair could face a challenge to his position as a leading figure in the Labour party, while Brown faces growing criticism for his handling of economic issues and his failure to deliver meaningful social reform.

It remains to be seen how long this feud will continue and what impact it will have on the broader political landscape in the UK. But one thing is certain - the legacy of the Iraq War will continue to haunt the country for years to come.",mistral7b,1
"

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have long been bitter rivals. They were both leaders of the Labour Party and served as Prime Minister for a decade each before the party lost power in the 2015 general election. Despite this loss, the two men continue to try and maintain control over their political legacy.

In an effort to move on from their past disagreements, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have made it clear that their main focus now is winning the next election and governing in the best interests of Britain. This means putting aside any personal differences and focusing on issues that matter most to voters.

""We may not always agree, but we know what's best for this country,"" said Blair during a recent speech. ""And that's why we're working together to make sure our vision for the future becomes a reality.""

Brown echoed these sentiments in his own statement: ""There's no doubt that there will be challenges ahead, but if we work together, we can overcome them and build a better future for all Britons.""

Despite their attempts at reconciliation, however, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown remain deeply entrenched in their respective positions. For example, when asked about his plans for the next election, Blair immediately began discussing policies he would implement as Prime Minister, while Brown focused on attacking Blair's record in office.

This rivalry has also extended beyond just the two men themselves. Many senior members of the Labour Party still harbor deep animosity towards one another and are reluctant to cooperate on any level. In fact, several key figures within the party have openly criticized Blair and Brown for their refusal to put aside their differences in the name of unity.

""It's time for us to stop acting like children and start behaving like adults,"" said one high-ranking Labour MP. ""If we want to succeed in the next election, we need to work together and focus on what really matters.""

However, even those who are calling for cooperation acknowledge that there are significant obstacles to overcome. For one thing, many people within the Labour Party simply don't trust Blair or Brown anymore - and they don't believe that either man is capable of leading the party to victory in the next election.

""I think it's too late for Blair and Brown to change their ways,"" said one prominent Labour supporter. ""They've both done too much damage to the party, and I don't see how they can ever earn my vote again.""

Despite these challenges, though, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are determined to do everything in their power to win the next election and secure their place in history as successful leaders of the United Kingdom. Whether or not they are ultimately able to achieve this goal remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: their rivalry continues to cast a dark shadow over British politics, and it will likely be years before they are able to truly move on from it.",mistral7b,1

Political News Article 1:

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has come under fire for his close ties to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his refusal to comment on allegations that the UK government is facing a corruption probe in the United States. In an interview yesterday, Mr Sunak refused to address reports that the US Department of Justice is looking into whether the UK government paid bribes to win contracts during President Trump's time in office.

Instead, Mr Sunak focused on his work as Chancellor of the Exchequer and emphasized the need for the UK to continue its economic recovery after the pandemic. He also spoke about his commitment to reducing debt levels, which he said were at their lowest since the early 2000s. However, critics argue that this focus may have blinded him to potential legal issues facing the UK government, including those related to corruption and fraud.

Despite these concerns, Mr Sunak remains popular among Conservatives and is seen as one of Prime Minister Johnson's closest advisors. He has been praised for his successful management of the UK economy during the COVID-19 crisis and for his efforts to reduce unemployment rates. However, many worry that his personal connections to the Prime Minister could lead to conflicts of interest and bias when making policy decisions. As the UK continues to face political and economic challenges, it will be important for the government to maintain transparency and accountability to avoid further controversy.

Political News Article 2:

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Sunak denied any involvement in corrupt practices or influence peddling during his tenure as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He stated that the UK government had always acted ethically and transparently, and that any allegations suggesting otherwise were politically motivated and baseless. He added that he was confident in the integrity of the UK civil service and had never sought to influence its decision-making processes.

Mr Sunak's comments came as former US ambassador Woody Johnson called on the UK government to disclose all financial transactions between Britain and the US during the Trump administration. The Ambassador claimed that the UK government had received millions of dollars in gifts and donations from wealthy Americans who hoped to secure favorable treatment in trade negotiations and other matters. While Mr Sunak did not directly respond to these claims, he stressed the importance of maintaining strong bilateral relations with the US and ensuring that both countries act in the best interests of their citizens.

Despite his insistence that there were no ethical concerns surrounding his actions, some experts have questioned the wisdom of Mr Sunak's refusal to engage with the ongoing investigation in the US. They argue that doing so risks damaging the UK's reputation abroad and undermining trust in its institutions. Additionally, they note that the UK government has previously faced criticism for its handling of foreign corruption cases, such as the Bribery Act scandal involving arms manufacturer Rolls-Royce.

As tensions rise between the UK and the US over issues such as Brexit, Huawei, and climate change, it will be crucial for both governments to uphold high standards of ethics and transparency to prevent further damage to their relationship and maintain public trust.

Political News Article 3:

In response to growing calls for greater scrutiny of the UK government's dealings with the US, Labour leader Keir Starmer has pledged to launch a full review of the UK's relationship with America if elected prime minister. During a speech to the Fabian Society today, Mr Starmer accused the current government of turning a blind eye to corruption and self-interest, and called on the US to provide more information about their interactions with the UK.

He argued that the UK should prioritize values such as democracy, human rights, and environmental protection in its relationships with other nations, rather than simply pursuing economic gain. He also criticized the UK's support for Saudi Arabia's military campaign in Yemen, arguing that the conflict had resulted in widespread humanitarian suffering and contributed to terrorism and extremism in the region.

While some see Mr Starmer's stance as a positive development towards holding the government accountable, others fear that it could lead to a breakdown in relations with the US. Some observers believe that a more critical approach to the UK's relationship with America could strain already tense negotiations over issues like post-Brexit trade agreements and climate change.

Mr Blair was speaking to MPs amid fresh rumours of a rift with Gordon Brown. The former premier has been increasingly critical of his successor's leadership, and it is understood that their relationship has deteriorated significantly in recent months.

The latest development comes as a new book claims that Mr Blair went back on a pledge to Mr Brown to stand down before the next general election. According to the book, which is due out this week, Mr Blair had promised Mr Brown that he would not seek re-election when the two men were still close friends in the early days of Brown's premiership. However, the author of the book claims that Blair changed his mind after becoming convinced that Brown was failing to deliver on key policies.

This revelation will only add fuel to speculation that the pair are at odds, and it is likely to further strain already tensions between them. It also raises questions over whether Blair's decision to break his word could have any implications for Brown's future as Prime Minister.

In response to the reports of a rift, Downing Street refused to comment on the matter, but sources close to Brown said that they hoped that the Prime Minister and Mr Blair could put aside their differences for the sake of the country. They added: ""We all know that there have been disagreements and differing opinions in the past. But what matters now is that we continue to work together to build a better Britain.""

However, it remains unclear how much damage has been done to Blair and Brown's relationship by these revelations. In particular, it may be difficult for Brown to regain public trust if it becomes clear that Blair was prepared to break one of his closest friendships for personal gain.

It is worth noting that while there have been many criticisms of Brown's leadership, there remain many people who believe that he has made significant progress in certain areas such as healthcare and education. Some even go so far as to say that Brown has been unfairly treated by Blair and others who were initially supportive of him.

Despite this, however, the fact remains that Mr Blair has been increasingly critical of Mr Brown's leadership in recent years, and it is unlikely that their relationship will ever recover completely. This is particularly true given the deep divisions within the Labour Party, where there are growing calls for a change of leader.

Indeed, some observers suggest that the fallout from this row could ultimately prove to be a turning point for both Brown and the Labour Party as a whole. For example, it may prompt some Labour MPs to call for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, or it could lead to the formation of a new anti-Blair faction within the party. Either way, it is clear that the political landscape in Britain is changing rapidly, and it will be fascinating to see how events unfold over the coming weeks and months.",mistral7b,1

Parliamentarians Warn Of Feud Jeopardising Election Hopes

A meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding between Jeremy Corbin and Boris Johnson could jeopardise Labour's election hopes. The tension between the two leaders has been mounting for weeks following their bitter exchange during prime minister's questions in the House of Commons.

The PM insisted that there is no chance that anything could derail Labour's campaign. Despite this, a new book claims that Mr Corbyn has upset his chancellor, Philip Hammond, by backing out of a pledged to step down as leader. This comes after the chancellor announced his plans to leave parliament ahead of the general election.

Labour MPs have expressed concern about how the leadership tensions will play out in the run-up to polling day. Some are worried that the infighting will distract from the party's message and undermine public support. Others fear that it could lead to a split within the party, making it harder for Labour to win back voters who were previously sympathetic to its cause.

As the row continues to simmer beneath the surface, it remains unclear what impact it will have on Labour's chances at the election. However, many observers believe that if the feud escalates, it could ultimately prove fatal for the party's prospects. With just over six months until voting day, time is running out for both sides to resolve their differences and focus on winning support from voters.

Meanwhile, other parties are taking advantage of the chaos surrounding Labour's leadership to gain ground. The Conservatives have been particularly successful in recent weeks, with opinion polls showing them leading Labour by up to ten points. This gap has narrowed since last summer, but many experts predict that it will widen again in the coming months.

Despite this, some Labour MPs remain optimistic that they can still turn things around. They point to recent victories in local elections and byelections as evidence that the party is still capable of winning votes. However, others argue that these results do not reflect broader trends and that Labour needs to make significant changes to its approach if it wants to avoid another disappointing result at the general election.

In an effort to address concerns about Labour's electoral performance, the party recently held a series of policy reviews aimed at identifying areas where it could improve. These included looking at issues such as housing, healthcare, and job creation. While some critics have accused the party of being too focused on socialist policies, supporters say that this is necessary if they want to appeal to a wider range of voters.

However, even if Labour does manage to come up with a more compelling policy platform, it may struggle to overcome the damage done by the ongoing leadership feud. As one MP put it: ""We need to get our act together before it's too late. If we don't, we risk losing everything we've worked so hard to achieve.""

PM Insists Nothing Will Derail Campaign

In response to reports suggesting that Mr Corbyn had upset his chancellor, the prime minister insisted that nothing would derail Labour's campaign. He told reporters that the party was united behind his leadership and that he was confident that they would be able to win back support from voters.

When asked about rumours that Mr Hammond had resigned because he disagreed with Mr Corbyn, the PM dismissed the suggestion as baseless speculation. ""I can confirm that Philip Hammond is very much part of our team,"" he said. ""He is committed to delivering the best possible outcome for our country and working tirelessly alongside me to achieve our shared goals.""

This statement came as a relief to many Labour MPs who had feared that Mr Hammond's departure could further destabilise the party. However, it also raised questions about whether or not the chancellor really is happy working under Mr Corbyn's leadership.

In recent years, Mr Hammond has become increasingly critical of Mr Corbyn's policies, particularly when it comes to Brexit. He has argued that the party should adopt a more moderate position on Europe and work closer with the Conservative government to find a way forward.

While Mr Corbyn has rejected Mr Hammond's calls for moderation, some analysts believe that the chancellor may eventually decide to break away",mistral7b,1

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were subjected to intense criticism at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labor Party on Monday, as MPs and peers alike ventured their opinions on the rift between Britain's Prime Minister and Chancellor. And it was largely that fear that led to the duo being read the riot act - an unprecedented move in recent political history - as concerns about the impact of the ongoing power struggle on the upcoming general election mounted.

In particular, many members of the PLP were deeply troubled by reports of a series of bitter clashes between Blair and Brown in recent days, which have been said to center on everything from budget cuts to foreign policy issues. These disputes, according to multiple sources, have been exacerbated by a perceived lack of trust and communication between the two men, leading to fears that the relationship could deteriorate further in the coming weeks and months.

The situation has become so dire that several senior Labor figures have reportedly called for Blair and Brown to put aside their differences and focus on winning the next election, due in May 2015. However, this call has fallen on deaf ears, as both men continue to engage in a war of words that is only likely to intensify in the run up to polling day.

Indeed, many observers believe that the current power struggle represents a major threat to the stability of the UK government, particularly given the already fragile state of public confidence in the ruling Conservative administration. With the economy still struggling to recover from the global financial crisis, many voters are increasingly skeptical of Blair and Brown's ability to lead the country forward and deliver the change they promised during the last election.

This sentiment was reflected in the comments made by several backbenchers and peers at the meeting, who expressed their deep concern about the direction in which the government was heading. In particular, there were calls for greater transparency and accountability from both Blair and Brown, as well as a renewed commitment to working together in the best interests of the nation.

However, despite these warnings, it remains unclear whether either man will be willing or able to reconcile their differences and put aside their personal animosity in favor of a more united front. Indeed, there are even some suggestions that the power struggle may actually be benefiting Blair and Brown, as each man seeks to bolster their own support base within the party.

Nevertheless, one thing is clear: the ongoing feud between Blair and Brown has already had a profound effect on British politics, sapping public morale and undermining the legitimacy of the governing party. As such, it is vital that both men are able to find common ground and work towards a shared vision for the future if they hope to maintain their hold on power beyond the next election.",mistral7b,1

The race for the new leader of the Liberal Democrats has officially begun, with the party's executive committee announcing that it would hold leadership elections over the next few weeks. This marks the first time in the party's history that it has held such elections, with previous leaders being chosen through internal ballots.

According to sources close to the party, the decision to hold open elections was made after several high-ranking members raised concerns that the current selection process was not fair or transparent enough. They argued that this could lead to a lack of representation within the party, particularly among underrepresented groups.

Under the proposed system, hundreds of potential candidates will be put forward by local branches across the country. These candidates will then be evaluated by a panel of expert judges, who will consider their qualifications, experience, and suitability for the role. In addition, members of the public will also have a say in the final selection process by casting votes online.

It is understood that the winning candidate will then be strongly encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election. While the Liberal Democrats are currently part of the ruling coalition government, there has been growing speculation about their future prospects in British politics. Some commentators predict that the party may eventually split from its conservative allies and form a separate centrist alliance.

If this were to happen, it would represent a significant shift in political landscape, with two major parties potentially vying for power alongside a third smaller force. However, even if the Liberal Democrats do decide to go independent, they would still face a tough challenge in securing enough seats to gain a majority in parliament.

As the election campaign gets underway, both sides of the debate have already launched attacks against each other. Supporters of the new selection process argue that it will bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the party, while critics warn that it could lead to chaos and instability.

One senior Lib Dem source told reporters: ""We can no longer afford to let the same old clique make decisions on behalf of our members. By holding these open elections, we can ensure that every voice is heard, regardless of where you live or what background you come from.""

However, another prominent member of the party warned that the move could backfire: ""This kind of radical change is never easy and we need to proceed with caution. We don't want to end up in a situation where anyone with a loud voice and big ambitions can simply take control, without any real regard for the consequences.""

Despite these concerns, the Liberal Democrat executive committee remains confident in its ability to navigate the challenges ahead. It believes that by embracing transparency and inclusivity, the party can win the support of more voters than ever before and help shape the future of British politics for generations to come.",mistral7b,1

Title: Feud between Labour leaders threatens to derail elections

A bitter feud between Labour party leaders has raised concerns over whether it can win a third term at next month's general election. The row erupted after former prime minister Tony Blair announced he would not stand for re-election and accused his successor Gordon Brown of failing to tackle key issues such as immigration.

The tension reached boiling point last night when Mr Brown faced criticism from his own cabinet members during a private meeting with MPs. Sources revealed that several normally loyal backbenchers warned the Prime Minister that continuing to feud with his predecessor could damage Labour's chances of victory in May.

In response, Mr Brown called an emergency press conference today to try and defuse the situation. He claimed that he had no intention of attacking Mr Blair but insisted that they needed to focus on the future rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

""I have always made clear my respect for Tony,"" said Mr Brown, who took office as PM after the resignation of Mr Blair two years ago. ""But we cannot afford to spend our time looking backwards or getting bogged down in what happened in the past. Our job is to move forward and build a better Britain for all.""

His comments were echoed by Shadow Chancellor Alistair Darling, who also distanced himself from the spat between the two men. ""We need to focus on delivering for working families and making sure people have access to good jobs, healthcare, and education,"" he said.

Despite attempts to downplay the row, however, tensions remain high within the party. It is understood that Mr Brown will face further criticism from colleagues later this week when they gather for another crucial meeting ahead of the polls.

Meanwhile, opposition parties are eager to exploit the divisions among Labour ranks. Conservative Party leader David Cameron accused Mr Brown of being weak and indecisive, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed that the government's handling of key issues such as the economy and immigration had been disastrous under Mr Brown's leadership.

""It is becoming increasingly obvious that the current government is unable or unwilling to tackle these problems head-on,"" Mr Clegg said. ""If Labour wants any hope of winning the next election, they must get their act together quickly.""

As the campaign enters its final weeks, Mr Brown knows that he must unite his party behind him if he is to secure a third term for Labour. However, with dissenting voices growing louder both inside and outside parliament, the path to victory remains fraught with danger.

One source close to the talks revealed that senior Labour figures privately concede that the rift between Mr Brown and Mr Blair could be fatal for the party. They believe that unless the pair can set aside their differences and present a united front, they risk losing support among voters who want stability and strong leadership.

""There are real fears within the party that if this feud continues, it could spell disaster for us come May,"" one source told The Independent. ""We need everyone pulling in the same direction if we are going to win.""",mistral7b,1

Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at loggerheads over the contents of Labour's next election manifesto, it has emerged. According to reports, the two senior politicians have clashed fiercely over issues such as healthcare reform and education spending, leading to a rift within the party. However, if press reports are to be believed, the pair were all smiles on Tuesday morning when they joined John Prescott to unveil Labour's latest poster campaign. The posters feature images of smiling families and happy children, highlighting the party's commitment to improving public services for all citizens.

The tension between Milburn and Brown comes after a series of high-profile resignations from the government, including that of Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt earlier this year. Many observers have suggested that these resignations could be a symptom of deeper divisions within Labour, particularly between those who support Brown's leadership style and those who prefer a more centrist approach. In recent weeks, there has also been speculation that Milburn may himself be considering leaving the government, although he has denied any plans to do so.

Despite their differences, Milburn and Brown remain key figures within Labour and will likely continue to work together closely until the upcoming general election, which is due to take place next year. In order to win back voters, Labour must present a united front and focus on delivering real improvements in people's lives. This is especially important given the challenges facing the economy, which continues to grow slowly despite efforts by the Bank of England to stimulate growth.

In addition to addressing economic concerns, Labour must also tackle a range of social and environmental issues head-on. For example, climate change poses an existential threat to humanity and requires urgent action from governments across the world. Labour has already made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy sources, but much more needs to be done to ensure a sustainable future for our planet. Similarly, social inequality remains a major problem in many countries, and tackling poverty and discrimination should be a top priority for any progressive government.

To achieve these goals, Labour must adopt a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnected nature of different policy areas. This means working across departments to develop coherent strategies that address the root causes of problems rather than simply treating symptoms. It also involves engaging with civil society groups and stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the needs and priorities of ordinary citizens. By taking a collaborative and inclusive approach, Labour can build stronger communities and create a brighter future for all.

As Labour prepares for its next general election, it is clear that the party faces significant challenges. But by staying true to its core values and focusing on the things that really matter, Labor can overcome these obstacles and deliver real change for the betterment of our society. Whether or not Brown and Milburn agree on every detail of the manifesto, one thing is certain: Together, they can help lead Labour to victory in 2010.",mistral7b,1

The recent election has brought to light a significant issue that has been debated by politicians across party lines - how to address the growing problem of crime while also dealing with internal conflicts within parties. Mr Howard, leader of the Conservative Party, posed this question during his speech at a rally in Manchester, where he criticized both Labour and Liberal Democrats for their failure to tackle this issue effectively.

""How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?"" Mr Howard asked rhetorically, drawing cheers from the crowd. His statement highlighted the fact that despite having different policies on various issues such as immigration, health care, and education, both parties have been more focused on attacking each other than on addressing the pressing concerns of voters.

In response to this accusation, leaders from both Labour and Liberal Democrats defended themselves, arguing that they had taken steps to reduce crime rates in their respective areas of responsibility. For example, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott pointed out that under her leadership, London's Metropolitan Police Force had achieved record low levels of violence, while Liberal Democrat home secretary Priti Patel boasted about increasing police funding to combat knife crime.

However, these responses did little to quell public dissatisfaction with the political establishment. Many people feel frustrated with the constant bickering between parties and lack of action on important issues like reducing crime rates and improving living standards.

It is against this backdrop that Mr Howard's question resonates particularly strongly with voters. By highlighting the futility of political infighting in the face of serious challenges, he tapped into a deep-seated desire among many Britons for greater unity and effectiveness in government. This sentiment was further reinforced by the release of a series of polls showing that public trust in traditional political institutions has reached its lowest point in decades.

Faced with mounting pressure to provide solutions rather than just criticism, party leaders began to acknowledge the need for cooperation and compromise. In an unprecedented move, representatives from all three major parties came together to discuss ways of working collaboratively to tackle crime and improve public safety. While initial discussions were cautious, there were signs of progress as participants agreed on the importance of shared resources and intelligence sharing in combating criminal activity.

Meanwhile, grassroots activists took inspiration from Mr Howard's call for unity and launched their own campaigns aimed at bringing communities together to fight crime. These groups, often composed of volunteers with no prior experience in politics or law enforcement, relied heavily on social media to mobilize support and raise awareness about local crime problems. Their efforts, although small-scale compared to those of professional politicians, demonstrated the potential for ordinary citizens to make a difference through collective action.

Despite these encouraging developments, however, it remains clear that tackling crime will require sustained effort and commitment from all stakeholders involved. Political parties must continue to work together, setting aside short-term differences in pursuit of long-term goals. At the same time, law enforcement agencies must adapt to changing threats and technologies, while civil society organizations and community members play their part by reporting suspicious activities and supporting victims of crime.

As Mr Howard's question echoes throughout the halls of power and beyond, one thing becomes increasingly apparent: The battle against crime cannot be won without cooperation and collaboration across political, social, and economic boundaries. Only then can we hope to build safer, stronger communities that truly reflect the values and aspirations of every British citizen.",mistral7b,1

Political analysts have been quick to dismiss the idea that the current political climate is as toxic as ever before, but new data suggests otherwise. According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, political polarization has reached an all-time high in America, with both Republicans and Democrats increasingly unwilling to compromise on key issues. But this analysis in fact gets it wrong. It's not just children who fight - adults do too. In fact, many of the most heated debates taking place right now involve grown men and women from both sides of the political spectrum.

One major factor contributing to this rise in polarization is social media. With platforms like Twitter and Facebook allowing users to connect with others who share their views, it's easier than ever for people to surround themselves with like-minded individuals and avoid those who disagree with them. This can lead to echo chambers where opinions are reinforced rather than challenged, making it harder for people to find common ground. Additionally, these same platforms often amplify inflammatory language and misinformation, further fueling the fire of division.

Another contributing factor is income inequality. Studies have shown that wealthier Americans tend to be more conservative while lower-income Americans lean towards liberalism. As the gap between the rich and poor continues to widen, tensions between these two groups are likely to increase. Furthermore, income inequality also contributes to geographical polarization, as cities tend to lean left while rural areas tend to lean right.

Finally, political leaders play a significant role in perpetuating polarization. Politicians often use divisive rhetoric to appeal to their base, which can create a sense of us versus them mentality among voters. This can make it difficult for politicians to work together across party lines to solve problems, leading to gridlock and frustration for everyone involved.

Despite these challenges, there are some reasons for hope. For one, younger generations seem to be less politically divided than older generations. Perhaps this is because they grew up in a world where diversity and inclusion were values promoted in schools and communities, or perhaps it's simply because they don't remember a time when the country was so divided. Whatever the reason, it's important to encourage young people to continue engaging in civil conversations and working together despite their differences.

Additionally, some organizations are making efforts to bridge the divide between different political groups. For example, the organization Common Ground Initiative works to bring people of diverse backgrounds together to participate in civic activities and learn from each other. By creating opportunities for people to work together towards common goals, it may be possible to break down some of the barriers that have led to such extreme polarization in American politics.

In conclusion, while the current political climate in America is certainly challenging, it's important to recognize that political polarization is not limited to any particular age group or demographic. Both Republicans and Democrats are equally responsible for perpetuating this problem through their use of inflammatory language and refusal to compromise on key issues. To truly address this issue, we need to work together towards a common goal and encourage open dialogue and cooperation among people of all political persuasions.",mistral7b,1

The political landscape has taken on new meaning as campaigns begin to gear up for the upcoming general elections. While the polls are not yet ready and will not be conducted until several months from now, it seems clear that this year's elections are well underway. With each passing day, candidates are working tirelessly to win voters over, and political analysts believe that the race is becoming increasingly competitive.

Despite this, many experts agree that the next few years could have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. In particular, issues such as Brexit and climate change are likely to be key factors in determining who gets elected and what policies they implement. These challenges could also lead to major shifts in voter behavior, making it difficult for any one party to predict their success.

As a result, politicians are paying more attention than ever before to how their messaging and actions might resonate with different segments of society. This includes reaching out to marginalized communities, addressing specific concerns, and adopting strategies that appeal to certain demographics. For example, some parties may emphasize economic growth and job creation, while others may prioritize environmental protection or social justice.

One way that politicians are doing this is by using speeches like those given during the last few days to outline their overall election manifestos. By laying out their priorities and plans in detail, these speakers hope to convince voters that they are serious about tackling the challenges facing the country. Of course, no politician can promise anything at this stage, but the public is eager to hear them speak about what they would do if elected to office.

In addition to these speeches, political leaders have been engaging in other activities that could influence the election outcome. Some have held rallies and town hall meetings to connect with potential supporters, while others have focused on getting their message across through TV ads, radio interviews, and online posts. As these efforts continue, we can expect to see even more activity in the coming weeks and months, as all sides work to secure votes and gain an edge in the polls.

While the election season is officially just beginning, it's already clear that this year's contest will be fiercely contested. With so much at stake, both major parties are leaving no stone unturned in their quest to secure victory. Whether they succeed remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the road ahead will be long and challenging.",mistral7b,1

Title: Labour Peer Proposes Bill to End Male Heir to the Throne

The succession to the British monarchy has been a topic of debate for centuries, and now it looks like things are set to change thanks to the efforts of a Labour peer. Lord Dubs, who was born into the Jewish community, has proposed a bill that aims to put an end to the current rule where male heirs automatically become king or queen, regardless of whether they have any sisters. Under his proposal, anyone, regardless of gender or religion, could potentially ascend to the throne if they are deemed fit to do so by lawmakers.

In addition to ending the male primacy of succession, Lord Dubs' bill would also abolish the longstanding ban on heirs marrying Catholics. This move would allow those from different religious backgrounds to marry and raise their children together without fear of losing their position as future rulers. Supporters of the bill argue that it is important to modernize our outdated laws and traditions, especially when it comes to issues such as marriage and family.

Of course, there will be many opponents to this proposal who feel strongly about preserving the traditional line of succession. Some may worry that allowing women or non-Christians to take on the role of monarch would undermine the stability of the institution itself. Others may simply feel uncomfortable with the idea of changing something that has worked well for thousands of years. However, Lord Dubs believes that we cannot ignore these changes forever, and that it is time for us to adapt to the world we live in today.

Ultimately, only time will tell what impact Lord Dubs' bill will have on the UK. It may not pass muster in Parliament, or it may face significant opposition from certain groups. But one thing is clear - the issue of succession to the throne is no longer the same as it once was. And as our society continues to evolve, so too will our laws and institutions.",mistral7b,1

Dick Morris, the former political consultant and commentator, has been called by many to be the ultimate winner in American politics. He is known for his ability to predict election results and make accurate predictions about political trends. In recent years, he has become even more popular among Republicans as they look for ways to regain their footing in Congress and the White House. Some pundits believe that it was Morris who helped turn things around for President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign and played a crucial role in his victory over Hillary Clinton.

Morris first gained notoriety in the early 1980s when he worked as an adviser on Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns. His reputation as a master of polling and strategy quickly spread throughout the political world, and he became one of the most sought-after consultants in Washington, D.C. During this time, Morris also developed a unique approach to politics, which he calls ""triangulation"" - taking positions somewhere between two extremes in order to appeal to voters from both sides of the issue.

Over the years, Morris has continued to use his triangular approach to great success. In fact, he is widely credited with helping to shape the modern Republican Party in America. He has advised several prominent conservative politicians, including George W. Bush and John McCain, and has made numerous appearances on television shows like Fox News and The Daily Show to offer insight into the latest developments in American politics.

One of Morris' greatest strengths is his ability to anticipate changes in public opinion and adapt his strategies accordingly. For example, after the 2000 Florida recount, Morris predicted that the new president would face a hostile Democratic majority in Congress. He then devised a plan for President George W. Bush to reach out across party lines and work with Democrats to pass legislation aimed at reducing the national deficit. The plan ultimately proved successful, earning Morris widespread praise and cementing his status as one of the most respected voices in American politics.

In addition to his political consulting work, Morris is also known as a prolific writer. He has authored several books, including the bestselling memoir Rove v. Ruloff: A War of Political Words, which offers a behind-the-scenes look at the 2004 presidential race. Morris has also written columns for various publications, including National Review and The Wall Street Journal, where he continues to offer his unique insights and analysis of American politics.

Despite his many accomplishments, Morris remains humble about his role in shaping American politics. He often downplays his impact and insists that he is just one of many people working behind the scenes to help elect leaders and advance causes they care about. But those who know him well say that Morris is truly deserving of all the accolades he receives. They describe him as a brilliant strategist who never fails to see the big picture and always knows how to bring people together to get things done.

As the current political landscape continues to evolve, Morris will undoubtedly remain a key player in shaping the future of American politics. Whether he is offering advice to candidates running for office or providing insights into the latest developments in Washington, D.C., there is no doubt that Morris will continue to be a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand what makes our political system tick. By any measure, Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner.",mistral7b,1

Political leaders are constantly making promises to the public, but what exactly do they mean when they say that? One such promise was made by former Labour leader Ed Miliband during his time as Prime Minister. He pledged Labour would encourage more people to achieve their aspirations. What did he mean by this statement?

It appears that Miliband was referring to a number of different policies that he thought could help people achieve their goals. For example, he promised to increase funding for vocational training programs so that workers could gain new skills and advance in their careers. This was seen as a way to help people who were struggling to find employment or were stuck in low-paying jobs.

Another policy that Miliband promoted was a plan to create more apprenticeships. He believed that these programs could provide young people with valuable work experience and help them acquire important skills that they would need in order to succeed later on in life. By providing more opportunities for young people to learn and grow, Miliband hoped to ensure that future generations had the tools they needed to thrive.

In addition to these initiatives, Miliband also talked about increasing access to higher education. He argued that everyone should have the opportunity to go to college or university, regardless of their background or financial situation. By expanding educational opportunities, he believed that more people would be able to pursue their dreams and achieve success.

However, not everyone agreed with Miliband's plans. Some critics accused him of being too focused on social welfare and not doing enough to promote economic growth. They argued that by investing in programs like vocational training and apprenticeships, Miliband was creating disincentives for businesses to hire new employees and invest in their communities. Others claimed that by promising to fund higher education for all, Miliband was simply trying to win over voters without actually addressing the root causes of inequality.

Despite these criticisms, however, it seems clear that Miliband was sincere in his desire to help people achieve their aspirations. Whether or not his specific policies were effective remains to be seen, but at least he was making an effort to address some of the challenges faced by working-class families and young people. And that, ultimately, is what really matters: whether our political leaders are willing to put aside short-term concerns in favor of long-term solutions that will benefit us all.",mistral7b,1

The political landscape is shifting rapidly for younger voters, according to new research from the University of Sussex. Only a quarter of 14-16 year olds know the basics of British politics, including which parties are in power. This contrasts starkly with older generations, where knowledge of politics has been found to be much higher among young adults aged 18-29. Despite this lack of understanding, however, it seems that young people do still have an interest in politics - almost three quarters said they had followed recent events closely. However, when asked to name specific politicians, many struggled. Just one in six could identify Michael Howard, leader of the Conservative Party during the 2005 election campaign. Meanwhile, only one in ten could recall Charles Kennedy's leadership as Liberal Democrat leader between 1997 and 2006. The study also found that most young people did not feel politically engaged or represented by any particular party, suggesting that there may be significant challenges ahead for political engagement among future generations.",mistral7b,1
"

The upcoming general elections have brought out fierce competition among political parties, with the Tories and Liberal Democrats vying for control of government positions. But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a ""fading"" force.

Despite being considered underdogs by many, the Lib Dems are confident that their message of progressive policies will resonate with voters this year. They argue that the current administration has failed to deliver on its promises, particularly when it comes to issues such as healthcare and education. The Lib Dems also claim that they would be better equipped to handle economic challenges and promote social justice than either the Tories or Labour.

Kennedy's comments were echoed by other members of the party, including former cabinet minister Nick Clegg, who said that the Tories had lost touch with ordinary people. He accused them of prioritizing tax cuts over investing in public services, which he argued was hurting the country's long-term future. Clegg also criticized the Tories for their stance on immigration, calling it divisive and unrealistic.

In contrast, the Tories have emphasized their commitment to reducing crime and improving public safety, as well as promoting small business development and job creation. Their leader, Michael Howard, has pledged to create a more compassionate Conservative Party that focuses on helping working-class families. However, critics argue that these proposals are too similar to those made by previous Conservative administrations, without addressing the root causes of the problems faced by the UK today.

As the campaign progresses, pollsters predict that the outcome of the election could be very close, with each party having an equal chance at forming a government. This has led to increased tension and scrutiny from the media, as both sides strive to gain support from voters. In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential impact of voter turnout and apathy, which could ultimately determine whether any one party emerges victorious.

Amidst all this uncertainty, there are signs that the electorate may be growing disillusioned with traditional political ideologies, and instead seeking out candidates who represent their values and priorities. For example, surveys have shown that young voters, in particular, tend to be more open to progressive policies and less swayed by party affiliation than older generations. This trend could potentially give the Lib Dems an advantage in certain areas, but may also make it harder for any single party to win a clear majority.

Overall, the 2005 election campaign promises to be a hard-fought battle between three major parties, each with its own unique vision for how to lead Britain into the future. While the Tories and Labour continue to dominate the headlines, the Liberal Democrats may yet prove to be the surprise package, providing voters with a new option for change and reform.",mistral7b,1

Under reforms proposed by the government, the role of the Lord Chancellor is set for significant changes as it seeks to streamline the justice system and separate the legislative and executive branches. This move has been met with mixed reactions from legal professionals who are concerned about the impact on judicial independence.

One key change under these reforms will see the removal of the Lord Chancellor's judicial functions. Under new laws, the position will no longer require the holder to be a qualified barrister or solicitor. Instead, they will simply need to have experience working within the legal sector, such as serving as a judge or magistrate.

""We believe that this change is necessary to ensure greater efficiency and transparency within our justice system,"" said Courts Minister Christopher Leslie. ""It also sends a clear signal that we are committed to ensuring the independence of the judiciary.""

However, many legal experts have expressed their concern over the loss of judicial power held by the Lord Chancellor. They argue that without this authority, the position may lose credibility and influence within the legal community. Additionally, there are concerns that the appointment process for the Lord Chancellor could become politically-driven rather than based solely on merit.

""This decision undermines the principle of judicial independence which has been at the heart of our constitution since its creation,"" said Bar Council Chair John Smith QC. ""If the Lord Chancellor loses his or her ability to provide independent oversight of the administration of justice, then it threatens the very integrity of our legal system.""

Despite these criticisms, however, the government remains steadfast in its commitment to reforming the justice system. It believes that these changes will help to reduce delays and improve outcomes for all parties involved, including victims, witnesses, and defendants.

In addition to the loss of judicial powers, the Lord Chancellor's salary and allowances will also be subject to review under these reforms. The government hopes to make savings in order to fund other areas of public policy, such as healthcare and education.

Overall, the changes to the role of the Lord Chancellor represent a major shift within the British justice system. While some may view them as an attack on judicial independence, others see them as a necessary step towards improving access to justice and reducing costs. Only time will tell how successful these reforms prove to be, but one thing is certain: they mark a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to modernize our legal system.",mistral7b,1

Political analysts have been closely watching Mr Brown's recent behavior, particularly his fixation on Ms Smith's gaze. According to sources close to the situation, Mr Brown has appeared increasingly agitated since the pair met at a conference last month. He is said to be deeply affected by Ms Smith's piercing blue eyes and often finds himself lost in thought when she speaks. One source even reported seeing him break down into tears during one of their meetings. Despite this apparent emotional turmoil, Mr Brown maintains that he is still committed to working with Ms Smith towards achieving common goals.

Meanwhile, the issue of education continues to dominate political discourse. The latest controversy surrounds a group of Kenyan schoolgirls who are currently being hailed as heroes for their remarkable achievements. Against all odds, these students from one of the country's poorest neighborhoods managed to secure top marks in national examinations, inspiring millions of people across the world. Their success serves as a stark reminder of the importance of equal access to education and highlights the need for continued efforts to improve educational opportunities in underprivileged areas.

In response to the girls' achievement, many politicians and activists alike have called for greater investment in schools and communities in order to foster similar outcomes. Some have also criticized the government for its failure to provide adequate resources for schools, resulting in poor academic performance and limited social mobility opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. While there may be disagreements over how best to address these issues, it is clear that education remains a central concern for many people both here and abroad.

As political leaders continue to grapple with complex challenges facing their countries, it is important to remember that progress can only be made through collaboration and shared effort. Whether it is through initiatives like the ones undertaken by these remarkable young women or more broad-based campaigns aimed at promoting equality and opportunity, every small step counts towards creating a better future for generations to come.",mistral7b,1

1. The British reality television star Duncan Bannatyne has taken a swipe at Prime Minister Tony Blair's handling of Iraq and his administration's response to the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster, which killed more than 230,000 people across several countries.

Bannatyne made his comments during an appearance on BBC Radio Five Live where he was discussing political issues. He accused Blair of being too focused on war rather than addressing global crises like the ones that devastated Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other countries in December last year.

He added: ""I think it's time for change. We can't continue to rely on this current bunch of politicians who have let us down so badly.""

Meanwhile, former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has expressed hope that Blair will one day step aside as prime minister to make way for Gordon Brown, whom he described as having the potential to lead Britain through difficult times ahead.

Cook said: ""If Tony decides not to stand again, then I believe Gordon could provide the leadership we need to steer this country forward.""

However, Cook warned against complacency, saying there are still many challenges facing both the UK economy and international relations. He urged the next leader to prioritize peacekeeping efforts, humanitarian aid and economic development initiatives.

""We must always remember that our strength lies in our ability to work together, both domestically and internationally,"" Cook said. ""It is only by doing so that we can overcome these challenges and build a better future for ourselves and generations to come.""",mistral7b,1

Title: Blair Dismisses Tories Claims On Tax Cuts

Prime Minister Tony Blair has dismissed Tory leader Michael Howard's claim that Labor will increase taxes after the election. According to Howard, the government will raise taxes by an estimated $10 billion in order to fund their policies, including education and healthcare reforms. However, Blair denied these allegations, stating that there were no plans to introduce new taxes or increase existing ones. The prime minister also accused the Conservatives of making unfounded statements on spending cuts, claiming that they had miscalculated the amount needed for wasteful expenditure reduction. This exchange between the two leaders highlights the ongoing political debate surrounding the upcoming general election and raises questions about the future direction of public finances in Britain. With just days remaining until polling day, the battle for voters continues, as each party seeks to convince them of their ability to lead the country forward effectively.",mistral7b,1

Starbucks, Rymans and a small Greek cafe are the latest victims of Westminster's political shake-up. As the general election approaches, both major parties have moved their headquarters just days apart, sparking speculation that they could be gearing up for a battle royale on poll day.

Labour has created an election campaign hub just three doors away from the Conservative Party's new headquarters in Victoria Street, which is located just a stone's throw away from the Houses of Parliament. The move suggests that the party believes it can win votes by being close to where the decision makers are based.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives have also shifted their base of operations from Whitehall to Victoria Street, leaving a string of shops vacant in the area. This includes a popular Starbucks branch, a Rymans store and a small Greek cafe, all of which have had to find new locations due to the political upheaval.

The two rival parties are not alone in making changes to their headquarters. Many other organisations, including charities and businesses, have been forced to relocate or expand their premises in order to accommodate the changing political landscape.

Despite these challenges, there remains a sense of excitement and anticipation in Westminster as the general election nears. With the stakes higher than ever before, both parties will be fighting tooth and nail to secure victory in what promises to be a thrilling showdown.

As the political dust settles, however, there may well be some casualties along the way, such as beloved local shops like Starbucks, Rymans and the Greek cafe. But in the grand scheme of things, these minor inconveniences pale into insignificance when compared to the bigger picture - securing the future of our country and shaping the destiny of millions of people.",mistral7b,1

Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed his hope for a new era of peace and stability in the Middle East, after meeting with US President George W. Bush in Washington DC this week. During their talks, Mr Blair emphasised the importance of democracy and human rights as key tools for fighting terrorism.

""We need to focus on building up democratic institutions and promoting civil society,"" Mr Blair said. ""That's where we can make the biggest difference in tackling extremism.""

Mr Bush, who has been criticised by some for his aggressive foreign policy towards Iraq and Afghanistan, agreed with Mr Blair's view. ""I think it's clear that military action is not the only answer when it comes to dealing with terrorism,"" he said. ""It's important to work together with other countries, including those in the region, to find solutions that are sustainable and effective.""

In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Mr Blair elaborated on his views. ""The best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights,"" he said. ""These values have proven time and again to be more successful than any form of authoritarianism or dictatorship in creating stable societies that prosper economically and socially.""

However, he also acknowledged that progress towards these goals would not be easy. ""There will always be challenges, but I believe there is an opportunity here to create a new order based on these principles,"" he said. ""If we succeed, we could see real change across the entire region, from Israel to Iran.""

Despite differences between Britain and the United States over the past decade, both leaders expressed a shared commitment to working towards a better future for the Middle East. As they stood side by side at a joint press conference, Mr Blair said: ""Our two countries share a common purpose - to build a safer world for our children and grandchildren.""",mistral7b,1

Article 1:

MEP Ashley Greenfield has resigned from his position after admitting that he regrets joining the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Guardian, Greenfield claimed that he was ashamed of having been affiliated with the group and referred to it as a ""joke."" Despite this, the politician stated that he intends on standing for re-election when the time comes. However, he remained mum on whether or not he plans on launching a new political party under the name Veritas, which means 'truth' in Latin.

Greenfield's decision to resign follows in the footsteps of several other high-profile Conservatives who have left the party due to dissatisfaction over its policies. Some of these defectors include former Chancellor George Osborne, former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, and former Defense Minister Philip Hammond. As more members of the Conservative Party begin to distance themselves from their former colleagues, it remains to be seen what effect this will have on future elections.

Article 2:

Ashley Greenfield, a Member of European Parliament (MEP) representing Wales, has announced his intention to leave the Conservative Party. This move comes just weeks before the upcoming general election, where Greenfield plans to run for re-election. In speaking with BBC News, Greenfield expressed his regret at ever joining the party, stating that it is nothing more than a ""joke."" However, despite his criticism of the organization, he did not confirm if he plans on starting a new political party under the name Veritas, which means 'truth' in Latin.

This development marks yet another blow to the embattled Conservative Party, which has faced numerous defections from within its ranks in recent years. Many politicians have criticized the party for its handling of issues such as Brexit, social welfare cuts, and healthcare reform. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly clear that the Conservatives are struggling to maintain their support among voters.

Article 3:

Ashley Greenfield, a Welsh MEP who previously represented the Conservative Party, has announced that he intends to run for re-election in the upcoming general election. However, during an interview with Sky News, Greenfield revealed that he no longer believes in the ideals of the Conservative Party and refers to them as a ""joke."" While Greenfield did not confirm whether or not he plans on establishing a new political party called Veritas, his comments suggest that he may be considering doing so.

If Greenfield were to create a new party, it could potentially draw support from disillusioned voters who feel that neither the Conservative nor Labour Party adequately represents their values or interests. It would also provide a fresh alternative for those seeking change within British politics. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how successful such a party might be given the current climate and the entrenched power structures within Westminster.",mistral7b,1

Title: Tories face backlash over spending cuts and tax hikes

The prime minister has faced fierce criticism from opposition parties after revealing plans to cut government spending by 20%. In a speech to a Labour Party rally, Gordon Brown accused the Conservatives of being reckless and shortsighted, arguing that their proposals could lead to economic failure. He warned that cutting funding for vital services such as healthcare and education could have serious consequences on society.

Meanwhile, Tory leader Michael Howard has defended his party's plan to raise taxes by 1p, saying it was necessary to pay off debt and fund public services. However, critics argue that this will put pressure on low-income families who can barely afford the increase. They also point out that previous attempts at tax reform have failed and resulted in higher rates of inequality.

Labour MP John Prescott described the Tory plans as ""irresponsible,"" warning that they would lead to job losses and increased poverty levels. He called on the government to work together with other political parties to find a more balanced approach to budgeting. The Liberal Democrats also weighed into the debate, criticizing the lack of detail in the Conservative manifesto and urging them to provide clearer information about how they intend to achieve their goals.

In response to the attacks, Conservative MP David Cameron denied any responsibility for the proposed spending cuts and insisted that his party had not made any promises regarding tax increases or reductions. He claimed that these issues were still under discussion within the party, and argued that there was no evidence yet to suggest that the economy was facing an imminent crisis. Despite this reassurance, however, many analysts remain skeptical about the Tories' ability to deliver on their promises and maintain the stability of the British economy.

As tensions between the two main parties continue to escalate, it remains unclear whether a general election is imminent. While both sides claim to be committed to working for the best interests of the country, their differing approaches to policy are likely to keep the debate alive until polling day. With less than a year to go before the next general election, voters may soon be forced to make a difficult choice between the current administration and a new leadership team.",mistral7b,1
"

The upcoming general election has been marked by a lot of debate on various policies, but one issue that has remained at the forefront of discussions among politicians and voters alike is taxation. The three main political parties have all put forward their plans for how they would approach this contentious topic, with each party offering its own unique perspective.

Despite pressure from both the Conservatives and Labour to lower taxes for businesses and individuals respectively, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to back down from his commitment to increasing revenue through higher taxes. This move could be seen as an attempt to appeal to voters who are looking for a more progressive leader, or it may simply reflect a belief that the current state of government finances requires significant reform. Regardless, it is clear that Mr Johnson's decision to raise taxes has sparked a great deal of controversy and raised questions about what impact such changes might have on the economy.

As polls continue to fluctuate in the weeks leading up to the election, the Liberal Democrats have emerged as the only major party willing to take a stand against increased taxation. Leader Jo Swinson has made it clear that her party would not support any further increases in income tax rates, arguing that doing so would hurt low-income households and stifle economic growth. Instead, she has called for greater investment in public services, including healthcare and education, to address the root causes of inequality and improve the quality of life for people across the country.

While some critics argue that the Lib Dems' position on taxation is too conservative, others see it as a refreshing departure from the traditional left-right divide on this issue. With many voters dissatisfied with both the Conservatives and Labour, the Liberals may well find themselves in a strong position to make gains in key marginals and potentially even form a coalition government if no single party wins outright.

Of course, the debate over taxation is far from limited to just these three parties. Many smaller groups and organizations also have their own specific ideas about how best to fund public services and promote economic prosperity. Some advocates of higher taxes argue that the wealthiest members of society should pay more in order to fund programs like universal healthcare, while others believe that reducing bureaucratic waste and improving efficiency would lead to more efficient use of resources and better outcomes for everyone involved.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether Mr Johnson's decision to raise taxes will prove successful or if it leads to negative consequences for the UK economy. However, one thing seems certain: the issue of taxation will remain at the center of political discourse for years to come. Whether voters ultimately choose a more liberal, socialist, or capitalist approach remains to be seen, but it's clear that the battle lines have already been drawn.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:

The British political landscape has been turned upside down by the rise of the Conservative Party under the leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The party has surged to victory in numerous elections since its election in 2019, including the Brexit referendum and the general election last year. This success has led many to believe that the Conservatives could be on their way to winning another term in office next month. However, even those who support the party acknowledge that there are still significant challenges ahead.

One of the biggest challenges for the Conservatives will be managing public expectations. Many people have high hopes for the party after their successful campaign, which included promises to deliver on issues like immigration control and increased funding for healthcare. However, it remains to be seen whether these promises can be met within the constraints of the UK's political and economic systems. Additionally, the party will need to navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to impact the country's economy and health care system.

Despite these challenges, however, supporters of the Conservative Party remain optimistic. They point to the party's track record of success over the past two years as evidence of their ability to govern effectively. In his 22 years in the Commons, Mr Johnson has shown a willingness to take risks and challenge traditional thinking. He has also demonstrated an impressive ability to mobilize voters, particularly among younger generations. These factors have contributed to the party's recent surge in popularity.

Of course, not everyone is convinced that the Conservatives are destined for greatness. Some politicians and commentators argue that the party's success is simply due to luck or circumstance rather than any inherent strength or vision. They also worry that the party's policies may not be sustainable in the long run. Nevertheless, even those who criticize the Conservatives acknowledge that they represent a formidable force in British politics today.

As the general election approaches, both sides of the political divide are preparing for battle. On one side, the Conservatives are confident that they can continue their momentum and win another term. On the other side, Labour is fighting hard to regain ground lost in recent years. With so much at stake, only time will tell which party will emerge victorious come polling day.

Article 2:

It is no secret that politics can be unpredictable and full of surprises. One area where this is particularly true is in the world of political predictions and forecasts. Despite the best efforts of analysts and pundits, many predictions about political events turn out to be wrong or at least off base. Even those who make their living predicting political outcomes know that nothing is ever certain when it comes to politics.

This is especially true in the age of social media, where misinformation and conspiracy theories can spread quickly and easily. In such an environment, it is easy to become overwhelmed by noise and distortion. As a result, it can sometimes feel impossible to discern what is really happening in the world around us. It is therefore important to approach all political predictions with a healthy dose of skepticism, regardless of how convincing they may seem.

Furthermore, even those who do manage to accurately predict political events must be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances. Politics is constantly evolving, and new developments can arise suddenly and unexpectedly. As such, it is crucial for anyone seeking to understand or influence politics to remain flexible and open to change.

Ultimately, while politics can be difficult to predict, one thing is clear. No matter what happens in the coming days or weeks, we will undoubtedly see more twists and turns along the path of political progress. Whether you agree with them or not, the actions and decisions made by our leaders are bound to shape the future of our society in profound ways. So, let us continue to engage in thoughtful discussion and debate, and seek to find common ground wherever possible. After all, if we want to build a better tomorrow, we must work together today.",mistral7b,1

John Houston, 54, had been a well-known figure in local politics for many years, having served as a councillor in the South Ayrshire area before moving to Lanarkshire. He had always been known for his strong conservative views and had spoken out against what he believed were overly liberal policies being implemented by the Scottish government. However, it appears that these views have now led to his downfall.

According to reports, Mr Houston's suspension came after he wrote an email expressing his opinions on various political issues to two Scottish newspapers. The content of the emails is not yet known, but sources claim that they contained language that could be considered offensive or inflammatory. It is also unclear exactly why Mr Houston was suspended specifically, but it is understood that he has been removed from the list of candidates set to run in the upcoming general election.

The move to suspend Mr Houston has sparked controversy both locally and nationally. Some are calling it an attack on freedom of speech, while others argue that it is necessary to maintain a certain level of decorum and professionalism within the political sphere. Regardless of where people stand, there is no denying that this case will have far-reaching consequences for the future of politics in Scotland.

Mr Houston himself has yet to comment on the situation, though his friends and supporters are rallying behind him. They say that he should never have been suspended simply for expressing his opinions, and that his removal from the ballot paper represents a blow to democratic principles. Whatever happens, one thing is clear: John Houston's career in politics looks like it may be over before it even began.",mistral7b,1

Tony Blair's legacy continues to be a topic of debate as Baroness Boothroyd reflects on his time in office. The former speaker, who was the first woman to hold the position, believes that Blair's decision to initiate certain reforms may not have had a clear outcome in mind. However, she acknowledges that these changes have brought about positive developments.

""It is difficult to say whether Tony Blair knew what he was getting himself into when he made decisions such as Iraq War,"" Baroness Boothroyd stated during an interview with the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. ""But I think he did realize the need for change within our society and economy, which led to significant progress being made under his leadership.""

The baroness further added that while she disagrees with some aspects of Blair's policies, she respects his efforts to improve Britain. She believes that it is now up to individuals and groups to build upon this foundation and continue to push forward.

""We cannot blame Blair entirely for everything that has happened since then,"" Baroness Boothroyd continued. ""But it is now our responsibility to take care of things and ensure that the benefits of his initiatives are sustained. We must also learn from past mistakes and work together to create a better future for all.""

Overall, Baroness Boothroyd's comments provide insight into the complexities of Tony Blair's legacy and how it will shape British political discourse in years to come. As she puts it, ""It is important to remember both the good and bad points about any leader or policy, and use that knowledge to move forward.""",mistral7b,1

Damian Hockney, one of Britain's most famous painters, has endorsed former chatshow host Mr Kilroy-Silk to lead the new eurosceptic party he founded earlier this year. The artist claimed that his friend and fellow art collector, Mr Kilroy-Silk, was the best candidate to lead a successful campaign against EU bureaucracy and overreach.
Hockney spoke out at an event promoting Mr Kilroy-Silk's book ""The Art of Being Silent,"" where he expressed his admiration for the politician's bold and unapologetic views on the European Union. ""I think it is time for someone who speaks their mind without fear or hesitation, someone who delivers better than anyone else,"" he told reporters. ""That person is Nigel.""
Mr Kilroy-Silk thanked Hockney for his endorsement and said he was honored to have such a respected figure supporting him. ""We are thrilled to have someone like Damian Hockney behind us,"" he said. ""He is not just an incredible painter, but also a voice of reason and truth in today's political landscape.""
Hockney's endorsement comes amid growing controversy over his involvement in UK politics. Some critics have accused him of using his influence to promote conservative ideology and attack liberal values. Hockney himself has denied any political leanings, saying that he simply supports candidates he believes will do the best job.
In response to these allegations, Hockney released a statement clarifying his position: ""As an artist, I believe in freedom of expression and the right to speak my mind.

Politics has always been an intriguing subject, with many different perspectives and opinions on various issues. In recent years, there have been ongoing debates surrounding government surveillance and its impact on individual freedoms. Lord Falconer insists that the proposed measures are necessary for national security but also stresses that they should be balanced carefully to protect citizens' rights. However, author Fredrick Forsyth takes a more critical stance, expressing concern over the erosion of privacy and freedom.

One of the most controversial aspects of the current political landscape is the proposed increase in government surveillance powers. This includes the ability to access individuals' communications without their knowledge or consent, as well as increased monitoring of online activity. While proponents argue that such measures are necessary to combat terrorism and keep the country safe from harm, opponents worry that these actions could lead to a police state where people are constantly monitored and spied upon.

Former Home Secretary Lord Falconer understands these concerns and has insisted that any new surveillance laws must be designed to balance the need for security with the protection of individual liberties. He believes that it is possible to implement effective surveillance programs while maintaining people's right to privacy. For example, he points out that existing surveillance laws already require authorities to obtain a warrant before conducting a search or wiretapping someone's communication.

Despite these assurances, however, some critics still believe that the proposed surveillance measures go too far. Thriller writer Frederick Forsyth told BBC News that he is deeply concerned about the erosion of privacy and freedom in our society. He fears that if we give governments too much power to monitor and control our lives, it will only be a matter of time before we lose some of the fundamental principles of democracy.

""We have always had to be careful not to let fear drive us into giving up essential freedoms,"" Forsyth said. ""But now, with the rise of social media and other forms of technology, it seems like we are at risk of sacrificing our privacy for what might appear to be greater security. We need to be vigilant about this issue and ensure that any new surveillance laws are designed in a way that respects our basic human rights.""

Forsyth's concerns are not unfounded. There have been numerous instances throughout history where governments have abused their surveillance powers for nefarious purposes. From Stalinist Russia to modern-day China, leaders who seek absolute control often resort to mass surveillance to maintain their grip on power. And while it may be tempting to think that such extreme cases are unlikely to happen here, there is no guarantee that they won't occur in our own society if we are not vigilant.

Of course, it is important to remember that the vast majority of politicians are committed to preserving our democratic values, even when faced with difficult decisions. Many politicians understand that there is a delicate balance between security and liberty, and that it is their responsibility to find ways to protect both. As Lord Falconer put it: ""The challenge is to create policies that are robust enough to defend our country against terrorist attacks but which don't undermine the very foundations of our democracy.""

That said, it is clear that the issue of surveillance remains highly polarized, with many people taking strong positions on either side of the debate. Some argue that any additional surveillance powers will inevitably lead to a loss of privacy and freedom, while others see it as an essential tool in the fight against crime and terrorism. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether they believe that the proposed measures are justified.

As the debate continues, one thing is certain: surveillance will remain a central issue in politics for many years to come. Whether we choose to embrace it as a necessary evil or reject it as fundamentally opposed to our democratic values, the decision we make today will have significant implications for generations to come",mistral7b,1

Amicus and the TGWU have announced plans to merge their union funds, which could potentially increase their political clout in the UK. The two unions are currently among Britain's largest trade unions, with Amicus boasting 1.2 million members and the TGWU having 800,000. Together, they will control a significant portion of the country's workforce.

The move is likely to be seen as an attempt to carry more weight with government ministers and employers. By joining forces, the two unions hope to use their collective power to push for greater protections and benefits for workers, including higher wages and improved working conditions.

Some critics argue that such mergers can lead to a reduction in choice and competition within the labor market, but supporters say that it allows workers to come together and fight for their rights more effectively. In any case, the announcement of the merger has already sparked debate on the future of trade unions in the UK and beyond.",mistral7b,1

1) In a shocking revelation, Mike Nattrass, UKIP's deputy leader, has been accused of making derogatory comments about Germany and its role in the European Union (EU). During a speech at a meeting held during last September's Hartlepool by-election campaign, Nattrass reportedly stated that Germany was using the EU as cover for a ""4th German Reich"". However, when confronted about his remarks, Nattrass denied any such accusations and claimed that they were taken out of context. The incident has sparked outrage among politicians from all sides, who have called for a full investigation into Nattrass' actions and potential affiliations with far-right groups.

2) As the debate over Brexit continues to rage on, tensions between the United Kingdom and other member states of the EU are reaching boiling point. One of the most vocal critics of the EU is UK Independent Party (UKIP) leader Gerard Batten, who has been accused of making inflammatory statements about the bloc in recent months. At a rally in London earlier this week, Batten was caught on camera saying that he believed the EU was responsible for ""the destruction of Europe"", and that it was time for the UK to leave the organization once and for all. While many agree with Batten's sentiment, others worry that his extreme views could harm the country's relations with its neighbors and undermine efforts to reach a deal on Brexit.

3) Another controversial figure within UKIP is Mike Nattrass, the party's deputy leader. In addition to his alleged comments about Germany, Nattrass has also faced criticism for his association with far-right groups in the past. He has previously spoken publicly about his admiration for Adolf Hitler and has attended rallies organized by neo-Nazi organizations. When asked about these associations, Nattrass has insisted that he is not a racist or extremist, but rather a patriotic citizen concerned about the future of the United Kingdom. Despite these claims, however, many remain skeptical about Nattrass' true motives and whether he is truly committed to promoting democratic values and human rights.

4) Amidst the controversy surrounding Nattrass, UKIP has continued to struggle in the polls. Since winning the 2015 general election, the party has seen a significant decline in support, with many voters turning away from its hardline stance on immigration and economic policy. This trend appears set to continue, as a new opinion poll released today shows that UKIP is now languishing in third place behind both the Conservative Party and Labour. With their popularity waning and their leader facing calls to resign following the latest allegations, the future of UKIP remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that the party may ultimately split apart, with moderate members breaking away to form a new centrist movement focused on social justice and progressive policies.",mistral7b,1

Union leaders have announced that they will hold a one-day national general strike on 23 March, involving up to 1.4 million UK workers, in protest at the government's handling of public sector pay and pensions. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) is leading the strike and has called on all public sector unions to join them. In response, the TUC has pledged its full support for the strike and urged all affiliated unions to participate.

Unite leader Len McCluskey said: ""We cannot allow this government to continue to treat our members like this. They are demanding more from us than ever before while refusing to give anything back in return. We cannot accept it and we will not be silenced.""

The PCS union said it would coordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions, including Unison, GMB, ASLEF, RMT, UCU and NGNU, who have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike.

Teachers, nurses, ambulance staff, firefighters, police officers, and civil servants are among those likely to take part in the strike, causing disruptions across the country.

The announcement comes after years of failed talks between unions and ministers over pay and pensions reform. Unions argue that their members are being paid less in real terms than ever before and that the government's pension plans threaten their future security. The government insists that there is no money left for increased salaries or pensions but that it remains committed to finding a way forward.

In recent weeks, several high-profile strikes have taken place in different sectors, including the Royal College of Midwives, Post Office workers, and rail workers, adding to growing pressure on the government to address the concerns of the workforce.

As tensions rise between unions and the government, many fear that this could lead to an unprecedented wave of industrial action across the UK, potentially causing significant economic damage and disrupting essential services.",mistral7b,1

Tony Blair is set to become Britain's longest serving prime minister if he wins a third term in power in the upcoming general election, according to political experts. The current leader has already served 2,838 days as PM - more than any other British leader since Winston Churchill during World War II.

However, Mr Blair still faces challenges before achieving this milestone. He must first win another term in office at the polls, which many predict will be a tough task given the public's growing dissatisfaction with his rule. Despite facing criticism on various issues including Iraq, Afghanistan and domestic policy, Mr Blair remains determined to stay in power.

If he does succeed in winning another term, Mr Blair would break the record for the longest continuous tenure of a British prime minister. This achievement would cement his place in history alongside legends such as Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Alec Douglas-Home. However, it would also spark debate among historians about whether his controversial decision to go to war in Iraq was worth the cost.

Regardless of what happens after the election, one thing is clear: Tony Blair will always be remembered as one of Britain's most divisive leaders. While some admire his leadership style and achievements, others view him as a failure whose actions led to devastating consequences for both the country and the world.",mistral7b,1

Peter Mandelson has been accused of launching a ""dirty tricks"" campaign against his old rival John Campbell as they continue their bitter feud over Brexit. The accusations were made by European Commissioner Phil Hogan at a rally in London on Saturday, just days after Mr Campbell announced plans to stand for election in next year's UK Independence Party (UKIP) leadership race. Mr Mandelson has denied any involvement in such tactics, but the charges have added another layer of tension between the two men, who have had a long-standing falling out dating back to their time together in New Labour.

As tensions rise between pro-Brexit politicians, both sides are becoming more aggressive in their attacks on each other. Mr Mandelson has been particularly vocal in his criticism of Mr Campbell, accusing him of spreading misinformation and being disloyal to the EU. Mr Campbell, on the other hand, has accused Mr Manderson of betrayal and dishonesty, claiming he promised one thing before the Brexit referendum and another afterwards. As the debate continues, it seems likely that this battle will not be resolved anytime soon.

Despite the ongoing feud, many people believe that Mr Manderson's campaigning skills make him a formidable opponent. He has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including allegations of corruption and a high-profile legal battle over his role in selling shares in News Corporation. But through it all, he has maintained a strong public presence and used social media to great effect in building support among voters. With so much at stake, it looks like the fight for supremacy in the UK political landscape will continue well into the future.",mistral7b,1

Title: Fears of Big Donor Bribes Spur Debate over Campaign Finance Limit

In recent years, fears that wealthy individuals and corporations are able to use their financial might to influence political outcomes have grown increasingly widespread. These concerns have led many to call for limits on campaign finance contributions in order to prevent such undue influence from taking place. The Electoral Commission (EC), which is responsible for regulating election campaigns in the UK, has weighed in on this issue by publishing a report exploring the potential benefits of introducing a campaign finance cap. While the EC acknowledges that there may be merit to the idea of limiting the amount that candidates can receive in campaign funds, they believe now is not the right time to implement such changes.

The EC's report comes at a time when concerns about the role money plays in politics are particularly acute. Recent high-profile cases involving large donations to political parties have raised suspicions among many people that these donations were used to sway public opinion rather than simply support a particular candidate or cause. As a result, calls for a campaign finance limit have been growing louder, with many arguing that such a measure would help level the playing field between candidates and ensure that everyone had an equal chance to win voters' support.

While the EC recognizes the potential value of implementing a campaign finance cap, they also acknowledge that there are several reasons why now may not be the best time to do so. For one, the commission believes that any changes to the current system should be made gradually in order to minimize disruption and allow for careful consideration of the potential impact on political participation. Additionally, the EC notes that there may be legal challenges to any attempt to impose a campaign finance limit, given the complex nature of electoral law and the need to balance competing interests and rights.

Despite these challenges, however, proponents of a campaign finance limit remain convinced that it is necessary if Britain wants to maintain its democratic integrity. They argue that without strict regulations in place to curb the power of big donors, political decisions will continue to be influenced by those who have the most money to spare. This, they say, is not just bad for democracy as a whole - it is also likely to exacerbate existing social and economic divides, as only the wealthiest members of society will be able to participate effectively in the political process.

As a first step towards addressing these concerns, many politicians and activists are calling for greater transparency in election financing. By requiring candidates to disclose all sources of funding and making it easier for the public to track how their money is being spent, advocates hope to create a more accountable and responsive political system. While this may not go quite as far as imposing a hard campaign finance cap, they believe it could still make a significant difference in terms of preventing undue influence and promoting equality.

Ultimately, whether a campaign finance cap ultimately proves to be effective remains to be seen. But with the ongoing debate surrounding this issue, it seems clear that the topic will remain firmly on the agenda for the foreseeable future. As policymakers grapple with the complexities of balancing competing interests and rights, they will no doubt face pressure from both sides of the argument - those who believe that campaign finance limits are essential for maintaining fair elections, and those who worry that such measures could stifle free speech and innovation. Whatever side of the debate one takes, it is clear that the issue of campaign finance reform will continue to be a hotly contested subject for many years to come.",mistral7b,1

Title: Shadow Cabinet Backed Compulsory ID Bill Despite Opposition from Some Senior Tories

The shadow cabinet has announced its support for the government's proposed bill to require ID for voting purposes, even as opposition from within their own ranks continues. Sources close to the discussions reveal that this decision was reached after an intense debate during a recent ""tough meeting,"" where several senior members of the Conservative Party strongly opposed the move.

Despite these internal conflicts, it appears that the majority of the shadow cabinet is now backing the legislation. A statement issued by a spokesperson for the group confirmed their stance and stated that they believe the measure will help prevent voter fraud and ensure fair elections. This comes just days before next week's vote in the House of Commons, which could set the stage for the introduction of compulsory ID across the UK.

However, not all Conservatives are happy with this development. Several high-profile figures have spoken out openly against the bill, citing concerns over civil liberties and privacy. These include home secretary Priti Patel, who has previously been critical of similar measures in other countries. Her opposition may put pressure on the government to reconsider their position or delay the implementation of the law until further consultation takes place.

In addition to Patel, others within the Conservative Party who have expressed reservations include former prime minister Boris Johnson and foreign secretary Dominic Raab. Their public statements have raised questions about whether there might be enough votes to pass the bill through Parliament when it comes up for debate next week. If significant numbers of Conservatives defect on the issue, it could potentially lead to a defeat for the government in the lower house.

While supporters of the bill argue that mandatory ID will make voting more secure and trustworthy, opponents contend that it could deter people from exercising their right to vote due to fear of bureaucratic hurdles or unwanted scrutiny. There is also concern that such measures disproportionately affect marginalized communities who may struggle to obtain proper identification documents.

As political tensions rise over this contentious issue, both sides will need to carefully weigh the potential consequences of their positions and engage in open dialogue if they hope to reach a resolution that works for everyone involved.",mistral7b,1

George Galloway, former Labour member turned Respect party leader, announced plans to run for parliament today. Mr Galloway won 150,000 pounds in libel damages against the Daily Telegraph last week and has used this victory as an opportunity to launch his campaign. He is expected to contest Bethnal Green, a working-class area in east London where Respect has been making gains in recent years.

Galloway's decision to enter the race comes after months of speculation about his political future. Since being expelled from Labour following his outspoken criticism of the Iraq war, Galloway has continued to speak out against what he sees as a lack of integrity and leadership within the mainstream parties. His announcement of intent to run for parliament marks the next step in his journey towards becoming a viable alternative voice in British politics.

In addition to his work within Respect, Galloway has also become known for his fiery speeches and media appearances. He has been particularly critical of the government's handling of the refugee crisis, calling it ""a shameful betrayal of human decency"". In recent weeks, he has also spoken out about his concerns over the rise of far-right movements in Europe, warning that these groups pose a serious threat to democratic values.

As the election approaches, many are eagerly watching how the various candidates will shape their campaigns. While Galloway's entry into the race may be viewed by some as a risky move, others see it as a much needed injection of fresh ideas and perspectives into the political landscape. Regardless of how the race unfolds, one thing is certain: George Galloway will not shy away from speaking his mind, no matter how uncomfortable or unpopular it may be at times.",mistral7b,1

1. In the wake of the dramatic February general election, documents have been released that shed light on failed negotiations between the then-prime minister and opposition leaders. The documents show that despite efforts from all sides, a coalition government was never able to be formed.
2. Among those who were involved in the negotiations was former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. According to sources close to him, he had appeared willing to form a coalition government but ultimately refused due to concerns over policy differences.
3. The failure to form a coalition government led to months of political instability, as the ruling party struggled to maintain its majority without the support of any other parties. This ultimately led to early elections and another change of leadership.
4. Many experts believe that if the coalition government negotiations had been successful, it would have led to more stability and continuity for both the ruling party and the country as a whole. However, it remains unclear what factors ultimately led to their breakdown.
5. As a result of these revelations, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability when it comes to political decision-making. They argue that if politicians are more open and honest about their intentions, it will lead to better outcomes overall.
6. Despite the setbacks of the past, some analysts remain optimistic that this newfound transparency could pave the way for more effective collaboration and compromise in the future. They point out that even though coalition governments can be difficult to manage, they often end up achieving much more than single-party rule.
7. Meanwhile, others are skeptical of the ability of political leaders to put aside their differences and work together in the best interests of the country. They argue that history has shown time and again that short-term gain is often prioritized above long-term cooperation and progress.
8. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear: politics will always be a complex and dynamic game. Whether or not coalition governments are successful, it remains to be seen how political leaders will navigate these challenges in the years ahead.",mistral7b,1

1) The Labour Party is shaking things up for its upcoming general election campaign by abandoning traditional methods of campaigning. In a surprising move, they are saying goodbye to their longtime practice of using a leader's battle bus and daily press briefings in Westminster. Instead, former Prime Minister Tony Blair plans to take the party's message directly to voters through visits to crucial cities and swing seats across the country. With this change in strategy, the Labour Party hopes to reach out to more people and gain support among those who feel disconnected from politics.
2) The Conservative Party has also made major changes to their campaigning tactics. They have announced that they plan to focus on grassroots efforts rather than relying heavily on social media or television advertising. This new approach involves engaging with local communities, hosting town hall meetings, and canvasing door-to-door. While it may seem like a departure from the fast-paced, digital age campaigns we have seen in recent years, conservatives believe it is essential to connect with voters face-to-face and listen to their concerns before making promises. By doing so, they hope to establish themselves as trustworthy representatives who truly care about the wellbeing of their constituents.
3) Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have decided to embrace technology in order to amplify their message. Their campaign strategy includes launching an innovative app that allows users to track their carbon footprint and learn how they can reduce their impact on the environment. Additionally, the Lib Dems plan to use social media influencers to promote their platform and encourage young people to vote. These moves reflect their commitment to addressing pressing issues such as climate change and youth participation in democracy. By leveraging technology, they aim to make their message more accessible and appealing to a wider audience.
4) As the election approaches, political parties continue to experiment with different ways to connect with potential voters. Some are shifting away from traditional methods while others are embracing them. Regardless of what strategies they employ, all sides remain determined to convince the public that their vision is the best one for the future of the country.",mistral7b,1

Robert Jackson, 58, a long-standing member of the Labour Party, announced his intention to quit the government today amid growing dissatisfaction with Tony Blair's leadership and controversial policies regarding European integration. The former minister for industry, trade and agriculture, expressed frustration that the party had not done enough to address issues such as immigration and poverty in Britain, stating: ""The party is losing touch with reality and failing to listen to people's concerns.""

In a press conference held earlier this morning, Jackson stated his reasons for leaving the party, which included his disappointment with the party's stance on Brexit and other key political issues. He also criticized the government's handling of the Iraq War, stating that it had been a major mistake that had led to countless deaths and destabilization of the Middle East region.

Blair responded to Jackson's announcement with an official statement, expressing gratitude for his service and contributions to the party over the years. He added that while he regretted their disagreements, he understood Jackson's decision and hoped that they could remain friends. However, the prime minister made it clear that he would continue to push forward with the government's policies without any interference from Jackson or other defectors.

Meanwhile, many members of the public reacted positively to Jackson's announcement, praising him for taking a stand against what they saw as a flawed government. Some even called for more politicians to follow suit, arguing that it was time for new blood and fresh perspectives to take charge of political affairs.

As the debate rages on about Jackson's departure, one thing remains clear - the UK political landscape has become increasingly polarized, with no end in sight. Only time will tell how things unfold, but one thing is certain - change is coming.",mistral7b,1

Political parties should take youth vote seriously
The results of a research by Electoral Commission suggest that young people aged between 16 to 20 years old have strong views on important issues such as crime and education. According to the survey, out of 3,486 respondents, over 80 per cent felt strongly about these matters. This indicates that political parties must pay more attention to winning the support of young voters if they want to secure their future success. It is crucial to understand what motivates them and how best to reach out to them.

Youth engagement key to democratic process
In light of this, the YVote Mock Election initiative has been launched to encourage young people to engage actively with the democratic process. Through this program, students will simulate an election campaign and get hands-on experience in organizing a political event. They will also have an opportunity to learn from politicians and experts who will be invited to speak at the event. By engaging with the political system early, young people can become informed citizens who contribute positively to society.

Survey findings highlight need for greater awareness
However, despite having strong views, many young people do not exercise their right to vote. Research shows that only half of all eligible 18 to 24-year-olds cast their ballot during the last general election. To address this issue, the YVote initiative aims to raise awareness among young people about the importance of voting. It encourages them to register to vote and provides information on where to find polling stations and how to fill out a ballot paper correctly.

Call to action for political leaders
The survey findings also serve as a wake-up call for political leaders. Young people are concerned about issues that affect their daily lives, such as employment opportunities, affordable housing, and environmental protection. If political parties want to win their support, they need to address these concerns effectively. Political leaders must listen to young people's voices and work towards creating policies that benefit everyone. Only then can we hope for a brighter future for our nation.",mistral7b,1

Meanwhile, opposition politicians have been quick to seize on Campbell's mistake as an example of the reckless nature of modern political communications.

Public Sector Unions to Hold Private Talks with Dep. PM John Prescott

In a significant development, five major public sector unions have announced that they will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labor's upcoming spring conference in Gateshead. The purpose of these discussions is to discuss the government's controversial plans to introduce new regulations that could raise the pension age for local authority employees from 60 to 65.

The union leaders expressed their concerns over the potential increase in pension ages and its impact on the well-being of public sector staff. In addition, they highlighted the importance of maintaining fair pensions policies across all sectors and urged the government to reconsider its decision.

""We believe that raising the pension age for council workers will not only harm their retirement prospects but also undermine morale and productivity in the public sector,"" said one of the union leaders. ""It is our hope that through constructive dialogue, we can find an amicable solution that takes into account the needs and interests of both employees and employers.""

Prescott has previously stated his commitment to finding solutions to issues facing public sector workers, including pensions reform. However, critics argue that such changes may lead to further cost cuts and reduced services for citizens.

Meanwhile, opposition parties called for transparency and openness in the negotiations between the unions and the government. ""It is important that any decisions made regarding pensions are subject to scrutiny and public input,"" said a spokesperson for the Conservative Party.

As the debate continues, it remains uncertain whether the government will back down from its plans or if the unions will ultimately agree to support them. One thing is certain though: the future of public sector pensions policy is set to be a hotly contested issue in the months ahead.",mistral7b,1

The upcoming general election is set to be one of the most closely watched in recent years, as political parties scramble to win support from key voter demographics. While young voters are often seen as the future of British politics, a new survey has suggested that older voters may have more sway than previously thought. According to the survey, conducted by charity Age UK, 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. This suggests that older voters may be more likely to exercise their right to vote and could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of this year's election.

Charity boss Gordon Lishman spoke about the importance of engaging older voters, saying: ""It is essential that we listen to the voices of older people and encourage them to get involved in the democratic process. Our research shows that older voters can make all the difference when it comes to winning elections, and we must work hard to ensure that they are able to have their say."" He added that younger voters should not be overlooked either, but that their numbers were simply too low to make the same kind of impact as older voters.

This sentiment was echoed by polling expert Professor John Curtice, who also pointed to the fact that older voters are generally considered to be more politically engaged and motivated than younger voters. However, he warned that this alone did not guarantee victory for any particular party, and that other factors such as campaign messaging and strategy would need to come into play to secure success.

As the general election approaches, political parties will undoubtedly focus heavily on appealing to key voter demographics in order to maximize their chances of victory. The findings of the Age UK survey suggest that targeting older voters could prove crucial, especially given their potentially significant influence on the outcome of the election. It remains to be seen which party will be successful in winning over these key voters and securing a decisive victory in this year's election.",mistral7b,1

Tony Blair has faced criticism over his comments that the UK should consider a universal basic income (UBI) to tackle poverty, saying such a scheme could lead to a disincentive for work. The former prime minister made the comments during an interview with Sky News, adding that UBI was not necessarily the solution to the problem. Meanwhile, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has called on Theresa May's Government to scrap its Universal Credit benefit system and replace it with UBI instead. This move is seen as a way to provide more support to low-income families who may be struggling financially due to cuts in benefits under the current welfare reforms.",mistral7b,1

Doug Smith's resignation from his position as chief executive of Jobcentre Plus was announced by work secretary Alan Johnson on 17th November, as MPs grilled him over the agency's poor performance. The resignation of Smith was a major blow for the government, who had been facing criticism over rising unemployment levels across the UK. Smith's departure marks yet another high-profile departure from the government, following the resignations of other key figures such as health minister Andrew Lansley and education secretary Michael Gove.

Johnson faced tough questioning from MPs over the reasons behind Smith's departure and the impact it would have on Jobcentre Plus. He defended the decision, stating that he believed the change in leadership was necessary to improve the performance of the agency. However, many opposition MPs were quick to criticize the move, arguing that the government should be focusing more on creating jobs rather than shuffling its top management.

The departure of Smith also raised concerns over the future of Jobcentre Plus and the wider welfare reform agenda. Smith had been at the forefront of implementing several controversial changes to the welfare system, including benefit cuts and increased sanctions for job seekers. Critics argue that these changes have only served to exacerbate the problems faced by unemployed people and have failed to create any meaningful improvements in employment rates.

Meanwhile, political commentators were quick to speculate over the motives behind Smith's resignation. Some suggested that he may have been pushed out due to internal power struggles within the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), while others believed that he simply no longer felt able to support the government's policies. It is worth noting that Smith himself has not commented on why he resigned or what the future holds for him.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the agency and the wider welfare reform agenda, there remains a sense of urgency among politicians to tackle the problem of rising unemployment. With millions of people still struggling to find work, the pressure is on for the government to come up with solutions that will help to get people back into jobs. This includes initiatives such as apprenticeship schemes, training programs, and tax incentives for businesses hiring new employees.

However, even as the government seeks to address the issue of unemployment, there are concerns over the long-term sustainability of its approach to welfare reform. Many critics argue that the cuts to benefits and increased sanctions for jobseekers are unsustainable and will ultimately lead to greater poverty and social unrest. They call for a more comprehensive approach to tackling unemployment, one that focuses on addressing the root causes of joblessness and investing in education and training programs.

In conclusion, Doug Smith's resignation from his position as CEO of Jobcentre Plus was a significant blow for the government and marked yet another high-profile departure from the administration. While Johnson defended the move and sought to focus attention on improving the performance of the agency, opposition MPs were critical of the decision and called for the government to prioritize creating jobs over reshuffling its management team. As the debate continues over the best way forward to address the problem of rising unemployment, it remains clear that the challenges ahead will require bold and decisive action from all parties involved.",mistral7b,1

In a rare interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke out against former Conservative leader Michael Howard's political attacks on him. According to Mr Blair, he believes that his actions speak louder than any words ever could when it comes to attacking Mr Howard's political tactics. He stated that he has always been open and honest about his opinions, and that if someone disagrees with them, they are free to challenge him. However, Mr Blair added that he does not believe in engaging in personal attacks or insulting language towards anyone.

Mr Blair also took aim at recent Labor campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which he claimed were ""anti-Semitic."" He said that such behavior is completely unacceptable, regardless of whether it is done by members of his own party or by others. The posters, he explained, made use of imagery and language that was intended to be offensive and hurtful to Jews. He went on to say that while he had nothing personally against Mr Howard, he did not support these types of attacks or propaganda.

When asked about his plans for the future, Mr Blair expressed confidence that he would continue to lead the government until the next general election. He said that he had always believed that leadership was about making difficult decisions and standing up for what was right, even when faced with opposition and criticism. While he acknowledged that there were challenges ahead, he remained committed to working hard and doing everything within his power to ensure that Britain continued to thrive and prosper.

Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding Mr Blair's tenure as prime minister, many people still see him as an important figure in British politics. Some have praised his efforts to improve healthcare, education, and other aspects of public life, while others have criticized him for his role in the Iraq War and various other issues. Regardless of where one stands on these matters, however, there can be no denying the significant impact that Mr Blair has had on the course of UK history during his time in office. As he continues to work towards the end of his term, Mr Blair will undoubtedly remain a major player in shaping the future of British politics.",mistral7b,1

1. Pension Protests Spread: A Growing Movement Among Seniors
The pension crisis has been a hot topic for years now, but it seems that things have finally come to a boiling point among seniors. The government recently announced plans to raise the retirement age by two years and reduce pensions for those who refuse to work past their current retirement age. This move was met with outrage from many retirees, who are already struggling financially due to inflation and rising costs of living. As a result, pension protests have sprung up all across the country, with thousands of senior citizens taking to the streets to voice their displeasure with the new policy. While some marched peacefully, others refused to pay the increased taxes on their pensions, risking imprisonment for non-payment.
2. Pension Protestors Take Their Fight to Parliament
With the number of protestors growing every day, the government was forced to take notice. Last week, representatives from various pensioner organizations went to parliament to present their case against the new policies. They argued that raising the retirement age and reducing pension benefits would force millions of seniors into poverty, leaving them no choice but to rely on food banks and other charitable organizations for support. Despite this, the government remains firm in its stance, claiming that the changes will help fund future pensions and ensure long-term sustainability. However, critics argue that these measures will only make things worse for current retirees, who deserve better treatment after a lifetime of hard work.
3. Senior Citizens Demand Change in Retirement Policies
As the protests continue, more and more pensioners are demanding change in the way the government treats seniors. Many are calling for an end to the two-tier pension system, which currently offers lower benefits to anyone who chooses not to work past their current retirement age. Others want the government to scrap the plan to raise the retirement age altogether, arguing that it is unfair to ask people to work longer than ever before when they are already facing financial difficulties. Still, despite these calls for reform, the government shows little sign of budging. Instead, officials insist that the pension crisis can be solved through a combination of cost-cutting measures and increased contributions from workers and employers alike.
4. The Impact of Pension Protests
The ongoing protests have had a significant impact on both the public and the government. For one thing, the media coverage has shed light on the struggles faced by seniors and raised awareness of the issue at hand. As a result, more and more people are beginning to take notice and demand change. Additionally, the threat of mass refusal to pay the increased taxes has put immense pressure on the government to back down from its original position. While it may still be too early to tell if these protests will lead to any real changes, they have certainly made their mark on the political landscape and shown that even the most vulnerable members of society can stand up and fight for what they believe in.",mistral7b,1

An article titled: Cross-Party Group Unveils Draft Bill for Second Chamber Reform
A cross-party group of MPs and peers has finally unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. The move comes after years of debate on the need for reform, with MPs and peers having failed to agree on any changes since 1999 when 600 hereditary peers lost their seats.
The proposed changes include a reduction in the size of the House of Lords from over 800 members to around 350, with only those who hold public office or have made significant contributions to society being eligible for selection. Additionally, under the new system, members of the upper house would serve six-year terms rather than life tenure, ensuring that there is greater turnover and accountability.
The draft bill also includes measures to increase transparency and democracy within the House of Lords. For example, all appointments would be subject to an independent review process, and members would be required to declare their conflicts of interest publicly. This would help to ensure that the House remains impartial and free from political bias.
Supporters of the proposal argue that it is long overdue and will bring much-needed reform to the UK's parliamentary system. They point out that other countries, such as Canada and Australia, already have similar systems in place, and that the current system is unsustainable and undemocratic.
Opponents of the plan, however, argue that it goes too far and could lead to a power grab by the government. They warn that reducing the size of the upper house and increasing its powers could erode the independence of the legislature and threaten democratic principles.
Despite these concerns, the cross-party group believes that the benefits of reform far outweigh the risks. They argue that a more transparent and accountable House of Lords will better represent the interests of citizens and ensure that politicians are held responsible for their actions.
As the draft bill moves forward, it will face intense scrutiny from both sides of the political divide. But supporters believe that this is the moment for real change, and that a new era of democracy and accountability awaits the UK.",mistral7b,1

Title: Schools to Boost Interest in Politics through M mock Elections

The Hansard Society has launched its annual Y Vote Mock Elections 2005, which is set to take place in more than 600 schools across the country. The aim of this initiative is to encourage young people to become interested in politics and to develop key skills such as speech writing, canvassing, and campaigning.

Pupils from participating schools will be given the opportunity to take on roles as election candidates, speechwriters, and pollsters, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the political process. Through hands-on experience, students will be able to see firsthand how political campaigns are managed and how important it is to engage with voters.

""We're excited to launch our Y Vote Mock Elections once again,"" said John Bercow, MP, who chairs the Y Vote Steering Committee. ""This year we hope to attract even more schools and pupils, helping to create a new generation of politically engaged citizens.""

As well as providing practical learning opportunities, the Y Vote Mock Elections also offer a platform for young people to express their opinions and ideas on key issues affecting their communities. By participating in this program, students will not only develop valuable political skills but also gain confidence in their ability to make a difference.

With over 600 schools already signed up for the 2005 event, it looks like the future of politics is brighter than ever before. As young people become increasingly aware of the need to get involved in shaping the world they live in, programs like the Y Vote Mock Elections play a crucial role in fostering that sense of civic responsibility.",mistral7b,1

In a stunning revelation, it was reported that Labour Party had received almost half of the total donations made to UK's political parties between January and June 2021. This is nearly half of the £11,724,929 received by 16 political parties listed by the Electoral Commission.

The Conservative Party came in second place with donations totalling £4,610,849, while the Liberal Democrats received just over £1m. These figures suggest a significant shift in public opinion towards more progressive policies.

Many experts have been quick to point out the importance of transparency in political finance, given the potential influence that large sums can have on policy decisions. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on the upcoming general election, but one thing is clear - voters are paying closer attention than ever before to where their elected representatives are getting their money from.

Labour leader Keir Starmer has faced criticism for accepting such large donations, particularly from wealthy individuals who may have ulterior motives. However, he has defended his party's fundraising efforts as necessary in order to compete effectively against well-funded opponents like the Tories.

Meanwhile, other parties have also come under scrutiny for their financial ties. For example, the Brexit Party, which only formed earlier this year, has already raised an impressive £3.5m in less than six months. Critics argue that this could give them undue influence over the ongoing Brexit negotiations.

As campaigning gets underway ahead of the next general election, it is likely that these issues will continue to dominate headlines. Political parties will need to tread carefully when it comes to raising funds, knowing that even small mistakes could have far-reaching consequences for their reputations and ultimately their chances of victory at the polls.

It remains to be seen whether the public will become increasingly disillusioned with traditional political structures and seek alternative options, or if they will remain loyal to the established parties despite concerns about their funding practices. One thing is certain though - the spotlight will remain firmly on the world of politics for the foreseeable future, with questions about transparency, accountability, and the role of money in shaping our democracy at the forefront of debate.",mistral7b,1

Title: Lib Dem Leader Warns of International, Domestic Issues in Election Campaign

Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable has warned that concerns over Iraq and other global issues are likely to surface during the election campaign. In an interview, he said that voters will be concerned with both international conflicts such as Syria and domestic problems like Brexit when they go to polls next year.

""It's clear that there is a lot of concern out there among people,"" Cable said. ""They want us to focus on what really matters - things like jobs, education, healthcare, and the environment. We need to address these issues head-on if we want to win back public trust.""

Cable's remarks came just days after an independent review was launched into how to increase voter turnout for future elections. The inquiry aims to identify ways to make voting more accessible and engaging for young people and minorities who tend to have lower voter participation rates.

As part of the effort to improve democracy, many political parties are looking closely at their own campaigns. They are trying to find new ways to connect with potential voters and appeal to their concerns. For example, Labour has promised to invest in schools and hospitals, while Conservatives have focused on reducing taxes and promoting growth.

But despite their different approaches, all the major parties agree that addressing the needs of ordinary voters will be crucial to winning their support. With only weeks left until the general election, time is running short for them to convince voters why they should choose their party over the others.",mistral7b,1

Article 1: Downing Street Denies Allegations of Pressure to Mislead Parliament

In recent weeks, there have been allegations that Downing Street exerted pressure on former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to provide misleading evidence to parliament regarding the Iraq War. These claims were first reported by journalist Peter Wilmott and are now being investigated by MPs on the Commons Justice Committee.

However, Downing Street has strongly denied these allegations, stating in a statement that there is no truth to them whatsoever. According to the government, Lord Goldsmith gave his independent legal opinion on the matter based on all available information at the time. The statement went on to say that Downing Street had always respected the independence of its advisors and would never seek to undermine their credibility or influence.

Lord Goldsmith himself has also come out to deny the allegations, stating that he was not ""leaned on"" in any way by Downing Street officials. He said that he provided his honest assessment of the situation based on his own analysis and did not feel pressured to do anything other than give an accurate account of his findings.

Despite this denial, some politicians have called for further investigation into the matter, arguing that if such allegations were true then it could have serious implications for the integrity of British democracy. They argue that if Downing Street was able to influence Lord Goldsmith's decision-making process, then it raises questions about the independence of judicial institutions and the rule of law.

Article 2: Attempt to Suppress Information About Iraq War Leads to Legal Challenge

Another controversial issue surrounding the Iraq War has emerged following a court battle over documents related to the conflict. In February 2016, campaign group Peace Action Trust (PAT) submitted a freedom of information request to Whitehall seeking details of UK military contracts awarded during the war. However, after several months of delays and refusals, PAT launched a legal challenge against the Ministry of Defence (MoD), arguing that it was trying to suppress important information from the public.

After a lengthy court hearing, the judge ruled in favour of PAT, ordering the MoD to release the requested documents within 35 days. This marked a significant victory for transparency advocates who believe that governments should be held accountable for their actions during conflicts.

The case also highlighted concerns about the use of private contractors in Iraq, many of whom have faced accusations of human rights abuses and fraudulent billing practices. Some critics argue that outsourcing key functions to private companies can lead to a lack of oversight and accountability, making it harder to hold those responsible for wrongdoing to justice.

Article 3: Political Divisions Deepen Over Brexit negotiations

As the UK continues to negotiate its exit from the European Union, political divisions have deepened among both Conservative and Labour parties. Many Conservatives are pushing for a hard Brexit, which would involve leaving the EU without access to its single market or customs union, while others fear this could damage trade relations with the rest of Europe.

Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbin has expressed his support for staying in the EU and has criticised Prime Minister Theresa May's handling of the negotiations so far. However, despite these differences, both sides have agreed to work together to find a solution that benefits Britain as a whole.

Some experts predict that negotiations will become increasingly fraught in the coming months, with tensions rising between different factions within each party. As such, it remains unclear how long it will take for the UK to secure its desired outcome and whether this will involve a hard or soft Brexit.",mistral7b,1

In recent years, there have been calls for members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) to step down from their roles after winning elections under a separate party's banner. This is due to concerns that the individual candidates may be more aligned with the policies of the party they are currently serving rather than those of UKIP.

One such case involves Damian Hockney, who was once a prominent member of UKIP and rose through the ranks to become its deputy leader. In 2004, he was elected along with fellow party member Peter Hulme-Cross using the list system, which allowed them to run together as part of a larger slate of candidates. However, this victory came at a time when UKIP was still relatively new, and the party had not yet established itself as a major force in British politics.

As UKIP grew in popularity over the years, it became increasingly clear that Hockney's affiliation with the party went beyond his membership card. He has since distanced himself from many of UKIP's core beliefs, particularly its support for Brexit, leading some to question whether he truly represents the views of UKIP voters.

Now, as the party faces a leadership election and looks to rebrand itself in preparation for future battles, questions remain about how closely tied Hockney is to UKIP's ideals. Some within the party argue that because he was elected as part of the UKIP ticket, Hockney should give up his seat and make way for someone who more clearly aligns with the party's values.

Of course, others say that Hockney has every right to continue representing UKIP in parliament, regardless of whether or not he was elected as an individual or as part of a group. Ultimately, only time will tell how much sway these debates carry, but one thing is certain: UKIP remains a powerful force in British politics, and its influence will likely be felt for years to come.",mistral7b,1

Howard's comments come as the government continues to push through legislation that would allow police and intelligence agencies more powers to investigate suspected terrorists. The former leader of the Conservatives said he had spoken to MPs from all sides who were concerned about the lack of scrutiny and accountability being afforded to these new measures. ""The fact that these measures are being passed without any meaningful consultation or debate only serves to undermine confidence in our democracy,"" Howard said.

Despite his criticisms, however, Howard refused to call for a vote of no confidence in the government over the issue. Instead, he suggested that there should be a wider public discussion about the balance between national security and civil liberties. ""This is not just an issue for politicians to discuss behind closed doors,"" he told reporters. ""It needs to be out in the open and subject to rigorous debate if we want to make sure we get it right.""

The Conservative Party believes that the prime minister is playing the fear card on this issue by suggesting that the Tories are weak on terrorism. According to party sources, Blair is using the controversy surrounding the anti-terror bill to try and divert attention away from other issues such as the economy and healthcare. They also claim that the bill will ultimately help protect the country against future terrorist attacks. However, critics argue that the measures could infringe upon basic human rights and civil freedoms.",mistral7b,1
"

1) The former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has revealed that he wrote the controversial answer given by Prime Minister Tony Blair on the legality of the Iraq War. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Lord Goldsmith explained that he had been asked by Mr Blair to provide a written response to criticism over the war's justification, which led him to write a lengthy document outlining his views on the matter.



2) However, Lord Goldsmith has denied any involvement from other key figures such as Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan in the drafting of the answer. He also emphasized that the answer represented only his personal opinion on the issue, and did not reflect official government policy or legal advice.



3) The revelation is likely to cause further controversy for Mr Blair, who faced widespread criticism during his time in office over his handling of the war. It comes after several reports suggested that Mr Blair may have misled parliament over the true reasons behind the invasion.



4) Meanwhile, the Labour Party has continued its campaign against the Iraq War, arguing that it was based on false information and led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the Guardian: ""Tony Blair should be held accountable for what happened. We can see now that the decision to go to war was taken without proper evidence or consideration of the consequences.""



5) Despite this, many politicians have come forward to defend the decision to invade Iraq, citing intelligence reports and the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC: ""The decision to go to war was made in good faith, and we believe that we were right to do so. Of course there have been mistakes made along the way, but those are regrettable and they won't change our fundamental position on the issue.""



6) As tensions continue to rise between the US and North Korea, President Donald Trump has warned that military action could be imminent if Pyongyang continues its nuclear weapons program. Mr Trump tweeted earlier today: ""North Korea must denuclearize. If they do not do it fast and properly, and if China does not help, we will have no choice but to take strong measures.""



7) His comments came after Pyongyang conducted another ballistic missile test yesterday, despite international pressure to cease such activities. The test prompted condemnation from world leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for all nations to work together to resolve the conflict peacefully.



8) In Europe, Brexit negotiations are at a critical juncture, with both sides struggling to agree on key issues such as trade rules and immigration. UK negotiators met with their EU counterparts today to discuss progress made so far, but differences remain significant. One source close to the talks described the atmosphere as ""intense"", with both sides unwilling to back down from their positions.



9) Elsewhere, elections are due to take place in Germany and Austria next month. Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to win re-election comfortably, but her Christian Democratic Union party faces challenges from the Greens and the Alternative Right.



10) In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced plans to ban assault rifles following the mass shooting in Quebec last week. The attack killed six people and injured five others, sparking calls for stronger gun control laws in the country. Mr Trudeau said: ""We cannot allow these horrific acts to continue. Canadians expect us to act, and we will.""",mistral7b,1

Lord Goldsmith's Written Answer Questioned Over Legality Of Iraq War
---------------------------------------------------------------

The legality of the Iraq war has been called into question once again, after it emerged that Lord Goldsmith's written answer on the issue may have been influenced by Downing Street. The claims surfaced during a heated debate in the House of Lords, where Lord Goldsmith vehemently defended his decision to sign off on the conflict as legal.

However, opposition politicians and campaigners have accused him of being pressured by government officials into issuing the statement, which they claim misled the public and led to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of civilians and military personnel. They argue that there was no evidence to support the UK's involvement in the invasion and that the subsequent occupation has only worsened the situation in the region.

In response to these accusations, Lord Goldsmith insisted that his position was based on sound legal principles and that he had acted independently of any political considerations or pressure from Downing Street. He claimed that there was ample justification for the intervention, citing Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program and his links to terrorism groups such as al-Qaeda.

Despite this defense, however, Lord Goldsmith's credibility has suffered due to previous revelations about his role in shaping the case for war in 2003. In particular, he faced criticism over his handling of intelligence reports that suggested there were no imminent threats posed by Hussein's regime, and that the US-led coalition was not justified in its actions.

These concerns were heightened further when it emerged that Lord Goldsmith had close ties with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and other key figures in the government at the time. Some critics argued that this meant he was more likely to act in their interests than those of the broader public, raising serious questions about the integrity of the legal process and the wider implications of the Iraq war.

As the debate continued in the House of Lords, many MPs expressed frustration and concern about the ongoing legacy of the conflict in the Middle East. They argued that the war had created chaos, instability, and suffering in the region, and that it was high time for the international community to take responsibility for its failings.

Amidst calls for accountability and transparency, some campaigners also renewed demands for an independent investigation into Lord Goldsmith's role in the lead-up to the war. They argued that the public needed to know the full extent of his influence and how much weight his opinions carried within government circles, in order to ensure that similar mistakes would not be repeated in future conflicts.

While Lord Goldsmith remained steadfast in defending his record, it is clear that his reputation has taken a significant hit since his tenure as Attorney General ended in 2004. As the fallout from the Iraq war continues to reverberate through British society and beyond, it remains to be seen whether he will ever regain the trust and respect of the public and the political establishment alike.",mistral7b,1
"

Lynton Crosby, the former campaign manager for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has denied having conversations with the Conservative Party about increasing their seat count by up to 30. According to The Times, Crosby advised party leader Rishi Sunak to prioritize winning more seats in parliament during his tenure as campaign manager. However, Crosby stated through his spokesperson that he did not hold such views and no discussions of this nature ever occurred between him and the Conservatives. This denial comes after reports circulated suggesting that Crosby urged Sunak to aim for a significant gain in the number of MPs held by the ruling party. Despite these claims, the Conservative Party remains focused on its ongoing efforts to strengthen its position in parliament.",mistral7b,1

Title: Labour Breaks Tradition and Chooses Manchester for Annual Conference

Labour Party officials have announced that their annual conference will be held in Manchester, marking a departure from tradition. The decision was made after careful consideration and was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. This will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the event.

Many political commentators are excited about this move, which is seen as an attempt to appeal to younger voters who may find it difficult to travel long distances to attend events on the coast. Additionally, Manchester has become an important hub for the tech industry, making it a popular destination among young professionals.

However, there are also concerns that hosting the conference in a city that has experienced significant social unrest in recent years could send the wrong message. There were several violent incidents in the city last year, including a stabbing spike that left dozens injured. Some critics argue that the party should choose a more stable location.

Nevertheless, many people are looking forward to seeing what kind of announcements and policies will be revealed at the conference. It promises to be a highly anticipated event, one that will likely set the tone for the party's upcoming general election campaign.",mistral7b,1

Title: Anti-Semitic posters spark controversy over election campaign

A controversial poster featuring Prime Minister John Howard has been criticised for being anti-Semitic during the upcoming Australian federal elections. The poster shows Mr Howard holding a pocket watch and hypnotising people, with the caption: ""I can spend the same money twice."" The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle who stated that it was reminiscent of Nazi propaganda. However, Labor insisted that the poster was merely anti-Tory.

This latest incident adds to growing tensions between political parties regarding accusations of religious discrimination and hate speech. The Liberal Party, led by Mr Howard, has faced criticism in recent years for its policies towards Muslims and asylum seekers, which have been described as Islamophobic and discriminatory. Some members of the community feel that these policies are targeted against them specifically because of their faith.

Meanwhile, the National Party, which is running on a platform of strong leadership and economic growth, has also come under scrutiny for its handling of immigration issues. Critics argue that the party's stance on asylum seekers is too hardline and fails to address the underlying causes of migration and refugee crises.

Despite these concerns, both parties continue to insist that their policies are not driven by any form of religious or cultural bias. They argue that they are simply focused on improving the lives of ordinary Australians through good governance and responsible fiscal management.

However, such claims may be difficult to swallow given the increasing polarisation in Australia's political landscape. As more people become politically engaged and vocal about their beliefs, there is a greater risk that inflammatory rhetoric and divisive ideologies could take hold and lead to deeper social divisions.

As such, it will be crucial for all political parties to work together to promote tolerance, understanding, and respect for diversity. This will require a concerted effort from leaders at every level of government, as well as a commitment to engaging in constructive dialogue and building bridges across different communities. Only then can we hope to create a truly inclusive and harmonious society that values our differences while working towards a common goal.",mistral7b,1

1) Mr Milburn faced criticism today from opposition MPs over his decision to use controversial advertising tactics to attack the Conservative Party. They accused him of engaging in political propaganda by using images that portrayed Conservatives as racist and bigoted. Mr Milburn defended the adverts, saying that while he understood the concerns raised by critics, he believed that what he had done was not anti-Semitic in any way, shape or form.
2) The Labour MP also argued that the ads were necessary to counteract the narrative being put forward by the Conservatives, which he claimed was divisive and exclusionary. He pointed out that many of the issues raised in the advertisements were based on real experiences of discrimination and prejudice that he himself had heard firsthand. Despite this, however, Mr Milburn conceded that the language used in some of the ads may have been too confrontational for certain audiences.
3) In response to Mr Milburn's comments, the Tory party issued a statement condemning his actions and accusing him of trying to smear their reputation. They demanded an apology from Mr Milburn, claiming that the adverts were nothing more than politically motivated attacks on the party. However, Mr Milburn refused to back down, insisting that he would continue to stand up for those who felt marginalized and excluded by the current government.
4) Meanwhile, there are reports that other politicians are considering following in Mr Milburn's footsteps and launching similar campaigns against the Conservatives. Some say that the party has become increasingly polarizing in recent years and that it is time for them to face up to their mistakes and take responsibility for creating a divided society. Others argue that such efforts are simply misguided attempts at playing the victim card and that the focus should be on finding practical solutions to the problems facing the country.
5) As the debate continues over the role of politics in modern life, one thing is clear: Mr Milburn will continue to be a vocal critic of the current government and will not shy away from speaking out about his views. Whether or not these efforts will succeed remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the battle lines are drawn, and the war between the parties looks set to rage on for quite some time to come.",mistral7b,1

Labour leader Keir Starmer has made it clear that he will be focusing on issues such as workers' rights, social justice and inequality during his upcoming general election campaign. This shift in focus marks a departure from previous leaders who have focused heavily on Brexit and economic policy. But no longer. Both Labour and the Tories have signalled their intention of making these central to their election campaigns.

Starmer believes that by addressing these issues head-on, he can appeal to a broad range of voters, including those who traditionally vote for the Conservatives. He wants to present himself as a leader who is willing to stand up against the powerful and protect the interests of everyday people.

The move comes after years of criticism that Labour had become too focused on winning over middle-class voters at the expense of working-class communities. By prioritising workers' rights and social justice, Starmer hopes to address these concerns and demonstrate that Labour is truly committed to fighting for the rights of all.

One key issue that Starmer has pledged to tackle is the growing gap between rich and poor. He plans to introduce policies that will help bridge this divide, such as increasing taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations and investing more money into education and healthcare.

Another area where Starmer intends to make progress is on environmental issues. He has promised to set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and transitioning the country to renewable energy sources. He also wants to create jobs in clean technology and promote sustainable development.

While the new approach may come as a surprise to some observers, it makes sense given the current political climate. With many voters feeling disillusioned by traditional political parties, there is an opportunity for a leader like Starmer to break through the noise and offer a fresh perspective. And by focusing on issues like workers' rights, social justice and the environment, Starmer could attract support from both left-wing and centre-left voters.

Of course, not everyone is happy with Starmer's pivot towards a more progressive agenda. Some Conservatives have accused him of trying to turn Britain into a socialist state and have warned that such policies would harm the economy. However, Starmer remains confident that his message resonates with ordinary people and that it offers a way forward for the country.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether Starmer's strategy pays off at the polls. But one thing is certain - this year's election promises to be a battle royale, with both major parties vying for the hearts and minds of voters across the country. Whether or not Starmer's newfound focus on workers' rights, social justice and the environment proves to be the winning formula remains to be seen.",mistral7b,1

Politics has been a hot topic of discussion lately, particularly regarding the upcoming general election in the UK. As politicians continue their campaigns across the country, Mr. John Kennedy, a prominent member of the Liberal Democrats, announced plans to tour several key regions on Monday. The aim was to rally support for his party and highlight the importance of voting in this crucial election.

According to reports, Mr. Kennedy will begin his day at 8 am by heading to Somerset, where he will visit several small villages that are considered crucial battlegrounds for the Liberal Democrat Party. These areas have seen significant demographic changes in recent years, making them ideal targets for the party's message of progressive policies and social justice. With many residents concerned about issues like healthcare and education, the Lib Dems hope to convince voters that their platform offers solutions that benefit everyone.

After spending several hours canvassing and speaking with locals, Mr. Kennedy will head back home before driving down to Hampshire, another region where the party hopes to gain ground. This time, he will focus specifically on rural communities and emphasize how important it is to protect these areas' natural beauty while promoting economic growth. Given the growing concern over climate change, the party believes that its stance on renewable energy and conservation could be major selling points for voters in rural England.

Later in the evening, Mr. Kennedy will travel north to Liverpool, where he will hold rallies aimed at energizing supporters and convincing undecided voters to join him in the fight against the Tories. In light of recent polls showing a tight race between the two parties, Liverpool represents an essential victory for the Liberals if they want any chance of forming the next government.

Despite the challenges ahead, Mr. Kennedy remains optimistic about the future of British politics. He believes that the people deserve more than just empty promises and political rhetoric; they need real action, transparency, and accountability. Whether he succeeds or not, there is no denying that the coming months will determine the direction of our nation for generations to come.",mistral7b,1

Article 1:

Newham council leader Graham Lane has criticized Prime Minister Tony Blair for being out of touch with ordinary people and failing to address their concerns. According to Mr Lane, ""the electorate are keener on the government than some Labour Party members"" due to the party's continued focus on divisive issues such as Iraq, foundation hospitals, and tuition fees. However, Mr Lane believes that it is actually the leadership style of Tony Blair that is causing the problems, rather than the policies themselves. He stated that Mr Blair's failure to listen to his own MPs and engage with voters has eroded public trust in both him and the Labor Party. As a result, he called for a new direction for the party and urged them to prioritize addressing the needs of working-class families and communities.

Article 2:

Tony Blair faces increasing criticism from within his own party after the latest poll showed that support for Labour among key voting demographics had fallen significantly. According to one senior source close to the prime minister, ""it's clear that something isn't right within our party."" This sentiment was echoed by several MPs who spoke out against Blair's leadership style and accused him of being out of touch with ordinary people. One prominent backbencher said, ""we need to take stock of what we stand for and where we want to go."" Another added, ""if we don't start listening to our constituents and putting their needs first, then we risk losing everything."" Meanwhile, opposition parties have seized on the poll results as evidence that the public is becoming increasingly disillusioned with Blair's rule. They argue that his failure to address issues such as crime, education, and health care has left many feeling abandoned by their elected representatives.",mistral7b,1

Charles Kennedy has announced his vision for the future of politics, promising a range of new policies that would benefit families, women, and the elderly. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader has said he wants to see a maternity income guarantee introduced to support women who are struggling to make ends meet when starting a family. He believes this policy would be popular among young mothers, many of whom find it difficult to balance work and childcare while trying to pay bills.

Kennedy also wants to reform the pensions system in Scotland, introducing a model based on years of residence rather than national insurance contributions. This move could help ensure that more people have access to a decent retirement income regardless of their employment history or how much they paid into the system. It could also encourage people to stay in Scotland longer, as they would be rewarded for their loyalty.

The Liberal Democrats have been at the forefront of calls for an end to university tuition fees in Scotland, which Kennedy reiterated today. He believes that higher education should be accessible to all, not just those who can afford it. Free tuition could lead to increased enrollment in universities, particularly from disadvantaged groups who may currently be deterred by financial barriers. Additionally, Kennedy has proposed free long-term care for the elderly, which could provide peace of mind for older Scots and ease pressure on the healthcare system.

Kennedy's announcement comes amid rising tensions between Scotland and the UK over issues such as Brexit and independence. He has previously criticized Boris Johnson's government for its approach to these issues, arguing that it does not adequately represent the interests of Scotland. However, he has expressed hope that there is still time to resolve these differences through dialogue and cooperation. In particular, he believes that the two sides must come together to tackle the challenges facing both countries, including poverty and inequality.

Despite these challenges, however, Kennedy remains optimistic about the future of politics in Scotland. He believes that there is still a strong desire for change and reform within the political establishment, and that this could lead to significant progress in areas such as health care, education, and social welfare. He also hopes that Scotland could become a leading voice in global efforts to address climate change and promote sustainable development.

Overall, Charles Kennedy's announcements highlight the importance of progressive policies in addressing the needs of families and vulnerable communities. By promoting equality, fairness, and sustainability, Kennedy is hoping to create a better future for Scotland that benefits everyone, regardless of background or circumstance.",mistral7b,1

Political leaders have announced plans to lower the minimum age requirement for Members of Parliament (MPs) from 21 to 18 years old. This change is expected to increase youth representation and participation in government decision-making processes.

The proposal was first recommended by the Electoral Commission last year as part of their review into electoral law. In response, Constitutional Affairs Minister Christopher Leslie has now stated that his department will implement this measure. He explained that young people deserve to have a voice at the table and should not be excluded based on their age.

Supporters of the move argue that it is essential to ensure that political decisions are made by those who will be most affected by them. They also believe that reducing the voting age will encourage more young people to engage in politics and become active members of society. Critics, however, warn that such a significant change could lead to unintended consequences and may result in less experienced MPs being elected.

The proposed reduction in the minimum age for MPs is just one of several measures aimed at increasing youth engagement in politics. Other initiatives include providing more education and resources to help young people understand how to get involved in local democracy, as well as creating more opportunities for young people to participate in policy discussions and debates.

While the announcement of the plan has received mixed reactions, many politicians are eager to see the change come into effect. They believe that it is crucial to listen to young voices and give them a seat at the table, where they can shape the future of our country. With the upcoming general election set to take place within the next few months, we can expect to hear more about these changes and what impact they might have on our political landscape.",mistral7b,1

It has been two years since the Brexit referendum and the UK is now officially out of the European Union. This historic moment marks the beginning of a new era for Britain and its people, as they navigate through this uncertain time of political turmoil.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been campaigning tirelessly for his vision of Brexit, which involves leaving the EU without any sort of agreement or treaty. His supporters argue that this would be the best way to secure a better future for Britain, while opponents claim that it could lead to chaos and uncertainty.

Despite the ongoing debate, one thing remains clear: the word ""Brexit"" will continue to dominate British politics for the foreseeable future. It has already had a profound impact on everything from trade and immigration to healthcare and education. As such, it is important for all citizens to remain informed and engaged in the political process if they want their voices heard and their needs met.

However, it's also worth noting that the word ""Brexit"" doesn't have to define every aspect of British culture and identity. While it may be tempting to focus solely on Brexit issues, there are still many other areas where progress can be made. For example, climate change continues to be a pressing issue around the world, and the UK should strive to work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of the EU.

Furthermore, the slogan ""Britain forward not back"" (no, it's not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary Time Lords) is meant to inspire hope and optimism in the face of adversity. By emphasizing the need to move forward and not dwell on past mistakes, it encourages citizens to look to the future and embrace change rather than fear it. And while this slogan may seem simple, its message is powerful and resonates with millions across the country.

Ultimately, the success of Brexit negotiations will depend on how well both sides are able to compromise and find common ground. Whether it's a hard or soft Brexit, the UK must be willing to listen and learn from others if they want to achieve their goals and build a brighter future for themselves and their children.

In conclusion, Brexit has brought unprecedented change to the UK and its people, but it is up to each individual to decide what kind of future they want to create. By working together and putting aside personal differences, we can overcome these challenges and pave the way for a more prosperous and harmonious society.",mistral7b,1

Politics has always been an interesting field, full of twists and turns that keep people engaged. In recent times, there have been debates over the role of police officers in society, and what steps can be taken to improve their effectiveness. Party leader Michael Howard recently made a statement on this topic, saying that he believes the introduction of a new role for police leaders will help address these concerns.

According to Howard, the new role would see the creation of a police authority that would work alongside existing police chiefs to ensure that they are able to do their jobs effectively. However, it is important to note that Howard's comments were made before any official announcement was made regarding the creation of this new role. As such, the details of how this new position would operate and what its responsibilities would be remain unclear at this time.

It is also worth noting that while Howard may support the idea of introducing a new police authority, other political figures have expressed concern over its potential impact on the force as a whole. For example, shadow home secretary Dianne Abbott has suggested that creating such a role could lead to confusion among police officers, who might not know exactly whose orders to follow if there are two separate authorities operating within the same organization.

Despite these criticisms, however, Howard remains committed to his proposal, believing that it would help bring greater transparency and accountability to the police force. He argues that by having someone else involved in decision-making processes, it will make it easier for the public to hold police leaders accountable for their actions. This, in turn, could help build trust between the police force and those communities they serve, which has been something of an ongoing issue in recent years.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether or not Howard's proposal proves successful in achieving these goals. While it is clear that he believes strongly in its merits, many others in the political world remain skeptical. It remains to be seen whether or not the proposed police authority will actually make a meaningful difference to the way the police force operates.

In conclusion, politics is a complex field filled with many different opinions and perspectives. Whether or not Michael Howard's proposal for a new police authority will prove successful remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - debate over the role of police officers in society is unlikely to subside anytime soon.",mistral7b,1

Another day another dollar, it seems, as the race for the presidency heats up. This time, however, the stakes are higher than ever before, with the candidates facing off in what is likely to be one of the most closely watched elections in American history. With just days left until the polls open, both sides are doing everything they can to win over voters and secure their vote.
But despite all the talk, there's still no clear front runner in the race. President Trump has been hit by numerous scandals and investigations in recent months, while his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has faced criticism for being too cautious and lacking energy on the campaign trail. As a result, many voters remain undecided or unsure about who they want to support.
In this environment, even small actions can make a big difference. That's why the non-profit group EveryVote is urging people to register to vote and make sure they are properly prepared for election day. By taking these simple steps, they believe that more people will actually go out and cast their ballots, which could ultimately tip the scales in favor of any given candidate.
However, there is one issue that has yet to be resolved: the role of politicians in determining who gets to participate in the election. According to the non-partisan charity, it would then be up to Tony Blair, Michael Howard, and Charles Kennedy to decide whether to take part. The chairman, Lord Holme, argues that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter ""of public interest,"" and that all eligible individuals should have an equal opportunity to vote.
Of course, this raises its own set of challenges. If political leaders were able to influence who voted and who did not, it could potentially skew the outcome of the election in favor of certain candidates or parties. On the other hand, if everyone was allowed to vote regardless of their political affiliations, it could lead to a less representative government overall.
Ultimately, the solution lies somewhere in between. It's important that we ensure that everyone who is qualified has the chance to participate in our democratic process, but at the same time, we need to find ways to prevent abuse of power and protect against foreign interference in our elections. Only through careful consideration and thoughtful action can we hope to build a fair and equitable society that truly reflects the values of democracy.",mistral7b,1

Chancellor Philip Hammond has announced that his Conservative Party will continue to prioritize economic stability if re-elected in May. During a speech at a Gateshead conference, Mr. Hammond pledged to support young homebuyers by providing more affordable mortgages.

Mr. Hammond stated, ""I am incredibly proud of our party's record on the economy. We have delivered growth, created jobs and reduced unemployment rates. If we are re-elected in May, my government will focus on ensuring continued stability while also investing in key areas such as education and health care.""

The chancellor added, ""We know how hard it can be for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder. That's why we are committed to helping those young people who are struggling. Our plan is to provide more affordable mortgages through innovative schemes and partnerships with banks and building societies.""

Labour leader Jeremy Corbin responded to the chancellor's announcement, stating that his party would focus on addressing the root causes of the housing crisis. He said, ""Our priority is not just to make houses more affordable but to ensure that everyone has access to decent quality housing, regardless of their income or background. This means tackling the issues of social mobility and inequality head-on.""

Title: Blair Slams Conservatives as ""Hard Right"" Amidst Iraq War Debate

Labour leader Tony Blair has launched a scathing attack on the Tory party, accusing them of offering a ""hard right agenda"" following their controversial decision to back the invasion of Iraq. In response, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox slammed Blair for lying about the reasons behind the conflict.

Fox's comments came during an interview with BBC Radio where he criticised Blair for not being honest with the public regarding the motivations behind the war. He said: ""I don't think there were any good grounds for invading Iraq and if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all.""

The Tory co-chairman added that Blair should be held accountable for his actions and that the public deserved to know the truth about why Britain went to war. He also accused the former Prime Minister of ignoring evidence that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, which led to the start of hostilities.

Blair's attacks on the Tories come amid growing calls for a full investigation into the decision to go to war with Iraq. Many critics argue that the war was based on faulty intelligence and that it has had disastrous consequences for both Iraq and the Middle East region as a whole.

Despite this, the Tory party remains staunchly supportive of the invasion, arguing that it helped to bring democracy to the country and prevent terrorism from spreading throughout the region. However, many people believe that the Tories have been inconsistent in their stance on the war and that they only supported it in order to gain political advantage over Labour.

As the debate continues, the future of Iraq remains uncertain. The country is plagued by ongoing violence and instability, with many people still living without basic services such as electricity and clean water. Some fear that the situation could deteriorate further, leading to even more bloodshed and suffering.

Amidst all this, politicians continue to squabble over whose policies were responsible for creating the chaos in Iraq. But what is clear is that the war has left a deep scar on the nation and raised serious questions about the role of Western powers in shaping global affairs.",mistral7b,1

1) Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of Britain, embarked on a boat tour across the serene waters of Lake Bromsgrove in Worcestershire as part of his campaign for the upcoming elections. He accompanied by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly, Blair sought to promote Labor's promise to prioritize education and ensure that every child has access to high-quality educational opportunities. The pair was greeted by enthusiastic applause from the locals who appreciated their commitment to improving the future prospects of young people in the region.



2) During his time aboard the vessel, Blair expressed his views on the importance of investing in education. He stated that schools must provide students with the necessary skills to succeed in today's competitive job market. To this end, Labor plans to increase funding for public schools and provide more resources to support teachers in delivering quality instruction.



3) After disembarking from the boat, Blair made an announcement that highlighted the government's commitment to improving education in the UK. He spoke about the need for schools to prepare students for lifelong learning and emphasized the role of teachers in shaping the minds of the next generation of leaders. His message resonated well with the audience, who were impressed by his passion for education and his dedication to making it accessible to everyone.



4) As the campaign continues, Blair remains committed to ensuring that every child in the UK has equal access to high-quality education. He believes that every student deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances. In order to achieve this goal, the government is working closely with schools and other educational institutions to develop innovative programs that will help young people thrive.



5) Meanwhile, the opposition party has accused Blair of neglecting the needs of students during his tenure as Prime Minister. They point to cuts in education spending and the rise in private tuition fees as evidence of a lack of investment in the future of the country's youth. However, Blair and his supporters argue that the government has made significant progress in improving education outcomes over the past decade and that these gains should not be jeopardized by short-sighted political attacks.



6) Despite the ongoing debate surrounding education policy, Blair's visit to Bromsgrove was widely praised by local residents. They appreciate the government's efforts to invest in education and are optimistic about the future prospects of their children. By focusing on education, the government can continue to build a better future for all British citizens and secure its place as a global leader in innovation and prosperity.



7) As Blair and Kelly continued their tour of the region, they encountered several challenges related to education. For example, they heard concerns from parents about bullying and discipline issues at local schools. In response, Blair promised to take action to address these problems and ensure that every school environment is safe and supportive of learning. His message of hope and determination struck a chord with parents, who were encouraged by his commitment to addressing their concerns and improving the lives of their children.



8) Overall, Blair's visit to Bromsgrove highlights the critical role that education plays in building a successful society. By investing in education, governments can create a workforce of skilled, motivated, and creative individuals who are equipped to tackle any challenge that comes their way. It is therefore essential that politicians prioritize education and make it a top priority in their policies and initiatives.



In conclusion, Tony Blair's boat ride through Lake Bromsgrove was a powerful reminder of the importance of education in building a brighter future for all. By stressing the need for investment in education and addressing the concerns of parents and students alike, Blair demonstrated his commitment to creating a more equitable and prosperous society. While there are still many challenges to overcome, Blair's vision for education provides a roadmap for policymakers and educators alike to follow.",mistral7b,1

Blair Calls Out For Another Dose Of Pain In Politics With ""Masochistic Strategy""

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has announced that he plans to take a break from his current political activities and return to the public eye as part of what he's calling his ""masochistic strategy."" According to reports, Blair will face off against a group of vocal critics who are known for being outspokenly critical of politicians on national TV.

The move by Blair comes after years of avoiding the limelight following his controversial decision to go to war with Iraq in 2003. Critics have accused him of lying to the public about the reasons for the invasion and of causing thousands of civilian deaths through its aftermath.

However, despite this criticism, Blair has maintained his position that he made the right decision and believes there are lessons to be learned from the conflict. He has also expressed a desire to engage with the public again and to offer new ideas and perspectives on how to move forward.

In recent years, Blair has taken a step back from public life and focused on his family and personal interests. However, he still keeps a close watch on the UK political scene and is said to be disappointed at the direction it is taking. Many believe that Blair's return to politics will be met with mixed reactions, given the controversies surrounding his time as prime minister.

One source close to Blair told us: ""Tony has always been a fighter, and he doesn't like sitting quietly while others do all the talking. This masochistic strategy is just his way of getting back into the game and showing everyone that he can still hold his own.""

While some see Blair's move as brave or even admirable, many view it as misguided or even foolish. After all, why would someone voluntarily subject themselves to the harsh scrutiny of the media and the general public when they could simply stay away?

Some critics have accused Blair of being insensitive to the suffering of those affected by the Iraq war and of using his influence to further his own political career. Others argue that Blair's actions were necessary to protect the country from terrorists but that he failed to communicate this effectively to the public.

Despite these criticisms, however, Blair remains convinced that there is still much work to be done in British politics and that his unique perspective and experience make him well-suited to help lead the country forward. He has already started working behind the scenes, consulting with advisors and preparing for his next public appearance.

As the debate over Blair's motives continues, one thing is clear: the former premier is not afraid to take risks or push boundaries in order to achieve his goals. Whether his latest move will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Tony Blair will never shy away from a challenge.",mistral7b,1

Political leaders have always known how important it is to appeal to voters during election season. But one politician has taken this to new levels by launching scathing attacks on his opponents' pensions and family policies in order to gain support.

In particular, the politician has been accused of trying to use the council tax as a way to score points against his opponents. He has been seen making comments about how the council tax could be slashed, which many believe are nothing more than political rhetoric designed to appease voters.

But what really caught people off guard were the personal attacks on his opponents' policies. The politician specifically mentioned how these policies would harm families and pensioners, implying that they were not concerned enough about the wellbeing of these groups. This has caused outrage among those who feel that the politician is using negative stereotypes to further his own agenda.

Despite the criticism, however, the politician seems unfazed. In fact, he appears to be thriving on the attention. During a recent speech, he took the opportunity to make even more incriminating remarks, accusing his opponents of being out of touch with reality.

""They may talk the talk, but when push comes to shove, they don't deliver,"" he said. ""Their policies may sound good on paper, but they simply do not work in practice.""

This kind of language only serves to fuel tensions between politicians and the public. Many people are tired of all the negativity surrounding politics, and want to see politicians working together to find solutions rather than attacking each other.

It remains to be seen whether or not the politician's tactics will pay off in the end. Some analysts believe that his attacks on his opponents' policies could actually hurt him in the long run, especially if they come across as too aggressive or confrontational.

However, others argue that the politician has already done enough damage. By making such personal attacks, he has managed to create a rift between himself and his opponents that may never be repaired.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether or not the politician's tactics will prove effective. But one thing is clear: the current political climate is becoming increasingly toxic, and it may take a lot of hard work to turn things around.",mistral7b,1

1. In a heated debate on taxation, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has questioned how fair it is that the poorest 20% of society continue to pay more as a proportion of their income than the wealthiest 20%. He raised concerns over the current system and urged the government to reconsider its approach.
2. The recent announcement of a £200 council tax rebate for pensioners has done little to address the issue of unfair taxation according to Ed Davey. The Lib Dem leader believes that more needs to be done to ensure that everyone pays their fair share and that no one is left behind.
3. As part of his campaign for fairer taxes, Ed Davey has called for an end to the council tax cap. He argues that this limit prevents local authorities from raising funds needed to improve services, such as healthcare and education. Instead, he proposes introducing a progressive tax system where those who can afford to pay more do so.
4. During a speech at the Labour Party Conference, Ed Davey highlighted the need for greater transparency in taxation. He demanded that companies reveal more information about their profits and where they are invested, arguing that this would help prevent tax evasion and promote fairness.
5. In response to criticism of the new welfare cuts announced by the Conservative government, Ed Davey has accused them of failing to tackle poverty and inequality. He argued that these measures will only benefit the wealthy few while leaving millions of people struggling to make ends meet.
6. The recent controversy surrounding HMRC's handling of the Apple tax affair highlights the need for greater accountability in our tax system, Ed Davey said. He called for an independent review of HMRC's practices and demanded that the company pays up its full tax bill without further delay or appeals.",mistral7b,1

British Chancellor Predicts Vaccine Could Be Found By 2012 If World Steps Up Funding Pledges
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK chancellor Gordon Brown announced that he expects to find a cure for diseases like malaria within the next decade, if countries increase their spending on research and development. The announcement was made during the second leg of the Prime Minister's trip through Africa, where they are focusing on poverty reduction initiatives.

Mr. Brown also expressed his concern over the current financial crisis and how it will impact developing nations, saying that the world needs to work together to ensure that everyone has access to basic services and resources. He added that the international community must prioritize investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure projects that will improve people's quality of life and promote economic growth.

During his speech, the chancellor emphasized the importance of innovation and collaboration in solving complex global problems. He highlighted several successful partnerships between developed and emerging economies that have resulted in breakthroughs in areas like renewable energy and medical research. However, he acknowledged that more needs to be done to address pressing issues like climate change, poverty, and disease.

The chancellor's comments came as part of his ongoing efforts to build stronger relationships with African leaders and secure support for the UK government's priorities. During his visit, he met with several heads of state to discuss issues ranging from trade agreements to aid packages aimed at helping poor communities.

While many were impressed by the chancellor's optimism and commitment to addressing global challenges, others questioned whether his vision can be realized given the current political and economic landscape. Some critics argue that there is little incentive for governments and multinational corporations to invest heavily in research and development when profits are already under pressure due to the recession.

Despite these concerns, however, the chancellor remains steadfast in his belief that collective action is essential to achieving long-term solutions to the world's most pressing problems. In particular, he believes that increased investment in science and technology can pave the way for major breakthroughs in fields like medicine, energy, and transportation.

In recent years, the UK government has been investing significant sums of money in scientific research, particularly in areas related to healthcare. For instance, the government has set aside $1 billion to fund new drug discovery programs aimed at combating antibiotic resistance, which poses a serious threat to public health worldwide.

However, even with this level of investment, scientists warn that much more needs to be done to overcome the numerous challenges facing humanity. They point out that despite advances in technology and medicine, we still face many unresolved problems related to disease prevention, environmental degradation, and social inequality.

To tackle these issues head-on, the chancellor argues that we need to foster greater cooperation among researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders. This involves sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise across disciplines and sectors, as well as encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations that can lead to novel approaches and innovative solutions.

As the world continues to grapple with the effects of the financial crisis and other global challenges, the UK chancellor's message of hope and optimism may serve as an inspiration for those who believe that progress is possible. Whether or not we achieve Mr. Brown's ambitious goals remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the quest for sustainable development and social justice requires collective effort, ingenuity, and determination.",mistral7b,1

Budget leak: The Tories accused the Labour party of a serious breach of Treasury confidence after it was claimed that a significant portion of their budget proposals were leaked ahead of their announcement next week. Shadow chancellor George Osborne demanded that Prime Minister Gordon Brown take immediate action to ensure that no further details were released before the budget is presented on Monday. He also called for an independent investigation into how the information was obtained and who was responsible. The Conservatives warned that any attempt to discredit or undermine the credibility of the budget would be met with a robust response from the party. They added that if such tactics continued, they could result in early elections being called.

Lib Dem call for statement: Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MPs called for Commons leader Peter Hain to make a statement following allegations that the government was behind the leak. They argued that the incident represented a clear breach of parliamentary privilege and demanded accountability from those involved. They also questioned why the government was so desperate to keep its plans secret when they had already promised transparency in their fiscal policy. The Lib Dems suggested that this could be because the proposed cuts are too deep and will cause widespread hardship for millions of people across the country.

Chancellors resign: In similar veins, previous Chancellors of the Exchequer have expressed concern at the prospect of another leak occurring. Lord Darling, who served under Tony Blair's administration, has previously stated that he believes there should be greater safeguards in place to prevent such incidents from happening again. He also hinted that he would not rule out resigning his position if the current government failed to act swiftly enough to address the issue. His successor Alistair Darling has yet to comment publicly but it is believed that he shares these concerns.",mistral7b,1

Casino Gambling News - Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell announced today that the UK government is considering a new form of casino gambling that would allow for the construction of up to six massive gaming venues across Britain. The proposals include measures to ensure that these casinos are regulated and controlled by local authorities.

In response to concerns over the potential negative impact of super-casinos on society, Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell has stated that the casinos being considered will not follow the same model as those seen in the United States. In particular, there will be no release of pheromones from machines designed to encourage aggressive gambling or removal of clocks from walls, which is common practice in American casinos. Instead, it's expected that these casinos will focus on providing entertainment and relaxation to customers rather than solely promoting gambling.

The announcement comes after months of debate surrounding the issue of gambling reform in the UK. Supporters of the proposal argue that introducing more casino gambling could boost the economy while opponents warn of the negative consequences such as increased crime rates and social problems associated with gambling addiction.

While the details of how these casinos would operate remain unclear at this time, it seems likely that they would be subject to strict regulations to prevent any harm coming to individuals or society as a whole. However, given the controversial nature of gambling and its potential impacts on people, it remains to be seen whether these plans will gain enough support to become a reality.",mistral7b,1

Title: PM's Plan For Immigration Reforms Faces Opposition From Both Sides Of The House

As Prime Minister David Cameron prepares to introduce his long-awaited immigration reform bill, he is faced with a daunting task of winning over both sides of the house. While the Conservatives are divided on the issue, they have been joined by their Liberal Democrat coalition partners who are also strongly opposed to the proposed changes.

Tony Blair, the former Labour Party leader and architect of many of the current immigration policies, has warned that any concessions made on the ""basic principles"" will only make things worse in the long run. He believes that the current system, while flawed, needs to be maintained to prevent a flood of immigrants into the country.

Despite calls for change from the public, the government remains firm in its stance on immigration. Home Secretary Theresa May has defended the new measures, saying they were necessary to protect British jobs and ensure fairness for those already living here. However, she has also acknowledged the need for more flexibility in certain areas to accommodate legitimate concerns.

One area where there is room for compromise is the treatment of EU workers. While the UK currently enjoys free movement within the EU under the Common Travel Area, this agreement is due to end when Britain leaves the European Union. This presents an opportunity for the UK to negotiate its own immigration policy with Europe, rather than being tied to one set of rules.

However, even on this front, there are disagreements among the parties. The Conservatives want to impose stricter controls on EU workers coming to the UK, including requiring them to apply for permission to work and pay taxes. They argue this would help to reduce competition for local jobs and ensure fairness for British citizens.

On the other hand, the Liberals believe that such measures would damage the UK's relationship with the rest of Europe and lead to retaliation against British businesses operating abroad. They also point out that many EU workers come to the UK because they cannot find decent employment in their own countries. By closing the door on these people, the UK may simply create another problem elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Miliband has criticized the government for not doing enough to address the root causes of illegal migration, such as poverty and political instability in the home countries of migrants. He argues that if the UK wants to control immigration effectively, it must focus on improving conditions in those countries instead of punishing people for trying to improve their lives.

Amidst all this uncertainty, it is clear that the fate of the government's immigration reform bill hangs in the balance. While the Conservative majority may give the government the numbers it needs to pass the legislation, it will face significant opposition from both the Lib Dems and its own backbenchers. Only time will tell whether the prime minister can navigate these treacherous waters and emerge victorious.",mistral7b,1

1) Sir Ian Blair, former commissioner of Scotland Yard, warned that terrorist attacks could target high-profile events such as the Royal Wedding, EU and G8 summits, and even the Olympics in London next year. He made these comments while discussing the Madrid train bombing that killed over 200 people in March 2004. The bombers had been linked to an extremist group called ETA.
2) In an interview with Sky News, Blair stated that terrorists would remember the impact of the Madrid bomb on Spain's recent elections. This attack was widely seen as a tactical victory for ETA and helped them gain support among certain sectors of the Spanish population. Blair believed that similar tactics could be used to disrupt other major events and cause chaos.
3) Another potential target, according to Blair, is the upcoming Olympic Games in London. With the world watching, any kind of terrorist activity could have disastrous consequences for both Britain and the global community. He urged governments and law enforcement agencies around the world to take every possible precaution to prevent such attacks from happening.
4) During his tenure at Scotland Yard, Blair oversaw numerous investigations into terrorist activities and worked closely with intelligence agencies to prevent attacks before they occurred. However, his reputation has been tarnished by several scandals related to Iraq War, including the death of British soldier David Kelly and the alleged cover-up of the weapons of mass destruction program in Iraq. Despite this, many still see him as one of the most knowledgeable figures on the subject of terrorism.
5) As the threat of terror continues to loom large, countries around the world are investing heavily in their security measures. Governments are increasing cooperation with each other and sharing information on known threats. Law enforcement agencies are also working more closely together to coordinate efforts and ensure that resources are being allocated effectively. While the risk of terrorist attacks remains high, it is clear that we will not let fear dictate our lives or prevent us from pursuing our goals.",mistral7b,1

Politicians have been criticized for their handling of the fox hunting issue after a poll showed that less than half of the UK population supports a total ban on the sport. In contrast, almost two-thirds of people supported a ban in 1999, according to a survey by Mori. However, the percentage of people who are neither pro-ban nor anti-ban has increased by 11%. This raises questions about whether the government is taking public opinion into account when making decisions related to fox hunting.

As such, politicians must carefully consider how to balance these competing interests in order to maintain public support.",mistral7b,1

Title: Brexit Plan for Immigrants from Non-EU Countries

The British government has announced new plans for immigrants from non-EU countries who come to live and work in the UK. The plan will be introduced as part of the ongoing Brexit negotiations.

If an individual plans to stay in Britain for six months or longer and comes from a country with high rates of tuberculosis (TB), they will need to undergo a chest X-ray and any necessary follow-up tests. This measure is being taken to ensure that all individuals entering the country are healthy and do not pose a risk to public health.

Under this plan, anyone who enters the UK from a non-EU country will also have to apply for permission to live and work in the country. This includes both students and workers. All applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as an individual's education, skills, and work experience.

Those who are granted permission to enter the country will be required to pay taxes and contribute to national healthcare costs, just like other residents. They will also be subject to the same laws and regulations as everyone else in the UK.

This new plan aims to protect public health and ensure that only those who are able to make a positive contribution to society are allowed to live and work in the UK. It is part of the government's wider efforts to control immigration levels and maintain a stable economy.

Some critics have expressed concerns about the impact of these measures on the UK's ability to attract talent from abroad. However, the government insists that it remains committed to welcoming highly skilled workers from all over the world. In fact, the plan specifically allows for exemptions for certain types of workers who are in short supply, such as doctors and engineers.

Overall, this new plan represents a significant step forward in ensuring that the UK remains open and welcoming while still protecting public health and maintaining a sustainable economy. As the Brexit negotiations continue, we can expect to see further developments in immigration policy in the coming weeks and months.",mistral7b,1

1. The Shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, claimed that the new White Paper released by the government was an effort to win over public support for the proposed European Union constitution. However, his assertions were refuted by the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Conservative Party of being afraid to engage in open debate.
2. In a heated exchange during a House of Commons session, Ancram argued that the White Paper represented a significant shift in the UK's stance on the constitution and would help sway undecided voters before the upcoming referendum. He also criticized the Labour government for failing to address concerns raised by citizens about the impact of the constitution on civil liberties.
3. Straw, however, dismissed Ancram's claims as mere political posturing and warned that the Conservatives were resorting to fear tactics to avoid confrontation with their opponents. He pointed out that the White Paper had been long-awaited and was not intended to soften anyone's position but rather provide clarity on the UK's stance on the issue.
4. The debate between the two shadow cabinet members sparked renewed interest in the constitutional crisis, which has been simmering since Britain first signed onto the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. With just months until the referendum on the constitution is held, both sides are gearing up to make their case to voters.
5. While Ancram's comments may have been politically motivated, they do reflect growing concern among many British people about the potential impact of the constitution on their rights and freedoms. As such, it remains to be seen whether the White Paper will succeed in convincing voters to support the proposal or if it will further fuel skepticism towards Brussels.
6. Meanwhile, other politicians from across the political spectrum have weighed in on the debate, with some arguing that the constitution is necessary to strengthen democratic institutions while others warn of dire consequences for national sovereignty and self-determination.
7. Amidst this flurry of activity, there are signs that public opinion may be shifting. A recent poll showed a narrow lead for those who oppose the constitution over those who favor it, suggesting that the tide may finally be turning against the proposal. Whether this trend continues remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the battle lines are drawn and the stakes couldn't be higher.
8. As the referendum date approaches, it becomes increasingly clear that the outcome will have far-reaching implications for Britain and its relationship with Europe. While the White Paper provides important context for understanding the government's position, it ultimately falls short of addressing many of the concerns voiced by critics of the constitution.
9. This has led some to question the sincerity of the government's efforts to win over public opinion. Some argue that the White Paper is little more than window dressing and that the government is simply running scared of facing down its own supporters and the electorate at large.
10. Others contend that the government's commitment to protecting individual liberties is genuine, even if these protections come at the expense of greater integration into European institutions. Whatever the motivations behind the government's actions, it remains clear that the fate of the constitution now rests in the hands of the voters.",mistral7b,1

Political News: UK Government Under Fire For Human Rights Violation

The British government is facing fierce criticism from politicians and human rights groups for its treatment of terror suspects following a ruling by the House of Lords. The decision came after the law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terrorist suspects without trial was a violation of their human rights. This has led to calls for an end to controversial measures such as control orders, which allow individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism to be subjected to house arrest, curfews or tagging.

Charles Clarke, who served as Home Secretary under Tony Blair's administration, introduced the control orders as part of his plan to counter terrorism. However, the policy has been widely criticized for infringing on civil liberties and due process. In recent years, there have been numerous cases where people were detained under control orders but never charged with any crime.

As a result of this legal victory against the government's policies, activists are calling for a complete repeal of the control order system and a more transparent approach to dealing with terrorism threats. They argue that while it is important to protect national security, this should not come at the expense of individual freedoms and rights.

Meanwhile, the opposition parties have used the issue to launch attacks on the current administration. Labour MPs accused the government of failing to provide adequate protection for citizens and undermining civil liberties. The Conservative Party also weighed in, saying they would scrap the control orders if they ever returned to power.

In light of the ruling and growing public pressure, it seems likely that the government will reconsider its stance on terrorism suspects. It may also lead to further changes in anti-terror legislation, including increased oversight of intelligence agencies and greater transparency in the justice system.

This ruling marks another blow for the UK government's attempts to balance national security with individual freedoms. With ongoing tensions between the two, it remains to be seen how long the government can maintain its hardline stance on terrorism without causing widespread outrage among citizens.",mistral7b,1

Date: September 14, 2022

By: [Your Name]

During his recent tour of African nations, Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for urgent action to be taken in order to achieve the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and reducing child mortality rates. In a speech delivered in [City/Country], Mr Brown emphasized the importance of meeting these targets and urged world leaders to take immediate steps towards achieving them.

The Prime Minister's call for action comes as he returns from a visit to several African countries where he witnessed firsthand the impact that poverty and lack of healthcare can have on children and families. During his trip, Mr Brown visited schools, hospitals, and community centers in countries such as [Countries] to see how progress was being made in improving living conditions and access to education and medical care.

Mr Brown also met with local leaders and international organizations to discuss ways to increase funding for programs aimed at addressing poverty and disease. He stressed the need for governments and NGOs to work together to find innovative solutions to the challenges faced by many African communities.

""We cannot afford to ignore the plight of those who are suffering due to poverty and poor health,"" said Mr Brown. ""As leaders, it is our responsibility to take action and do everything we can to help lift millions out of poverty and reduce child mortality rates.""

His call for action was welcomed by many attendees at the conference, who expressed their support for initiatives aimed at helping improve living conditions for people around the world.

Political tensions continue to simmer as Mr Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, visits Beijing. During his visit, Mr Straw highlighted the ongoing arms embargo against China, Burma, and Zimbabwe, but not North Korea. He also mentioned that China's human rights record is abysmal. According to him, the European Union (EU) has imposed an arms ban on China since 1989 following the Tiananmen Square protests. In contrast, North Korea remains under strict sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program and human rights violations.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government has responded to these remarks by stating that it is committed to resolving conflicts peacefully and respecting international laws. However, they have also criticized Western countries for imposing unfair sanctions on their country without evidence of wrongdoing. They argue that such measures only harm innocent people and impede progress towards economic development.

The situation in North Korea continues to be volatile, despite international efforts to denuclearize the region. The United States and South Korea recently conducted joint military exercises, which Pyongyang sees as a provocation. On the other hand, North Korea has continued to carry out missile tests and threaten to use force if necessary.

In Europe, there are growing concerns over Russia's actions in Ukraine. The EU has condemned Moscow's annexation of Crimea and called for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, recent events suggest that Russian forces may be preparing for another invasion. This has led many EU member states to increase their defense budgets and strengthen security cooperation.

In India, Prime Minister Modi has been praised for his pro-business policies and strong stance against terrorism. His government has implemented several reforms aimed at boosting economic growth, including deregulation and privatization. However, critics have accused the BJP government of neglecting social issues and suppressing dissent.

In Australia, the new government has promised to focus on regional stability and combat climate change. Prime Minister Morrison has pledged to reduce emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, making Australia one of the first developed countries to set such a target. He has also emphasized the need for closer ties with neighboring countries and increased defense spending.

Overall, political developments across the world highlight the complexities of modern governance. While leaders strive to promote economic growth and maintain security, they must also address pressing social issues and uphold democratic values. As global challenges continue to evolve, it will be essential for policymakers to work together and find innovative solutions that benefit all members of society.",mistral7b,1

1. Mr Brown's call for investment in infrastructure, science and education has been met with mixed reactions from political leaders. While many have praised his vision, others fear that such investments could lead to a decline in public spending on other areas, such as healthcare and social welfare.
2. In an interview today, Mr Brown spoke out against those who criticize his plans for increased funding for research and development. He argued that without these investments, the UK would fall behind its global competitors and lose its position at the forefront of innovation.
3. The former Prime Minister also highlighted the need for more investment in renewable energy sources, arguing that this would not only benefit the environment but also create new job opportunities in the green economy. He urged policymakers to take a long-term view of energy policy, rather than focusing solely on short-term cost savings.
4. Mr Brown also touched upon the issue of immigration, stating that he believed that the UK needed to attract talented workers from across the globe in order to remain competitive. However, he cautioned that any increase in immigration must come alongside measures to ensure that existing residents were able to access good jobs and services.
5. In a speech earlier this week, Mr Brown emphasized the importance of investing in education and skills training programs in order to prepare young people for the demands of the modern economy. He argued that without these efforts, the UK would struggle to retain its position as a leading exporter of goods and services.
6. Many politicians have welcomed Mr Brown's focus on infrastructure investment, particularly in the context of Brexit. With the UK set to leave the EU in just over two years, there are concerns that the country may face economic challenges if it fails to secure adequate trade deals with its European partners.
7. The former Prime Minister also discussed his views on the ongoing debate surrounding a second referendum on Scottish independence. He expressed his support for maintaining the Union, but acknowledged that any decision on the matter should ultimately be left up to the people of Scotland.
8. In conclusion, Mr Brown's comments have sparked a lively discussion among political commentators and analysts. Some see his calls for increased investment in infrastructure, science, and education as necessary steps towards ensuring the UK remains a leading force in the global economy. Others argue that such investments come at too great a financial cost and risk undermining the government's ability to provide essential services to citizens.",mistral7b,1

Title: Lord Falconer Outlines Plans for Parental Access

Lord Falconer has announced that curfews and community service orders are among the options that could be used if parents continue to defy court orders granting them access to their children.

The constitutional affairs secretary made the announcement during a press conference on Tuesday, as he outlined some of the measures that would be taken to ensure compliance with these court orders. He emphasized that while every effort will be made to work out an agreement between both parties, it is important to have clear consequences for those who refuse to abide by the law.

""We cannot tolerate any situation where children suffer because of a failure to respect legal obligations,"" said Lord Falconer. ""It is our responsibility to protect the wellbeing of every child, regardless of the circumstances.""

He also noted that there will be ongoing support available for families facing challenges when it comes to access arrangements. This includes mediation services and counseling, as well as financial assistance if necessary.

Despite this, Lord Falconer acknowledged that there may still be instances where parents refuse to comply with court orders. In such cases, he said, it may become necessary to use coercive measures like curfews or community service orders to ensure that they do not put their children at risk.

However, he emphasized that these measures would only be used as a last resort, after all other efforts to resolve disputes had failed.

""Our ultimate goal is always to find a solution that works for everyone involved,"" said Lord Falconer. ""But we cannot ignore the fact that sometimes people act in ways that put others at risk, including their own children.""

His comments come after recent high-profile cases involving parental access disputes, where some parents have been accused of refusing to allow their ex-partners to see their children. In one case, a father was even jailed for failing to comply with a court order allowing his estranged wife access to their son.

As Lord Falconer outlined his plans, he urged both parents to take their responsibilities seriously and work together to find solutions that prioritize the best interests of their children.

""Parental rights are essential, but so too are responsibilities,"" he said. ""Let us remember that what matters most here is that our children grow up happy, healthy, and loved by both their parents.""

Overall, Lord Falconer's announcement serves as a reminder that there are real consequences for parents who fail to abide by court orders regarding access to their children. While the hope remains that most families can resolve their disputes through cooperation and mutual understanding, it is clear that some situations may require more forceful intervention.",mistral7b,1

The upcoming Brexit referendum is set to cost almost as much as a general election, according to government officials. In a written parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie stated that the poll was likely to come at a similar expense as a full-blown electoral contest. However, Mr. Leslie emphasized that the cost of the referendum should not be compared with the only previous British referendum, which took place over three decades ago. Despite this warning, it is clear that the Brexit vote will have significant financial implications for taxpayers, and critics have accused the government of trying to downplay these costs in order to sway public opinion in favor of leaving the European Union. As the debate rages on, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability when it comes to spending on political campaigns and referendums.",mistral7b,1

The political landscape is always filled with scandals, controversies and personal issues that often threaten to consume politicians. However, one such scandal recently took place in Parliament which left many stunned. A high-ranking MP was caught cheating on his wife and had an affair that led to a bitter custody battle for their child. The affair involved sex, betrayal, and even allegations of abuse, but what made it even more shocking is that this time it has nothing to do with either David Blunkett or Boris Johnson.

It turns out that Westminster itself has its own divorce den, where divorced couples can go through the legal process without any public scrutiny. This private system allows politicians to keep their affairs under wraps while they continue with their work in Parliament. But when things come to light, as they did in this case, the fallout can be devastating.

In this particular instance, the MP in question found himself facing intense media attention and criticism from both the public and fellow politicians. There were calls for him to resign and questions about whether he should be allowed to remain in office given the nature of the allegations against him. Some even suggested that he should be stripped of his seat in Parliament.

However, despite the uproar, the MP managed to maintain his position and continue with his duties in Parliament. He faced a backlash from many who felt that he had betrayed not only his family but also the trust of his constituents. Others argued that it was unfair to hold him to different standards than other politicians who have been caught in similar situations.

One thing that is clear is that the affair highlighted the double standard that exists when it comes to personal relationships among politicians. While many are quick to condemn those who have affairs, few seem to notice the hypocrisy of holding them to higher ethical standards than themselves. After all, many prominent politicians throughout history have engaged in extramarital affairs and gotten away with it.

This raises questions about why we expect so much of our politicians in terms of morality and ethics. Do we really want them to lead perfect lives, free of personal flaws and mistakes? Or is it enough for them to simply do their job effectively and represent their constituents' interests?

Ultimately, the answer lies in the balance between personal and professional life. Politicians are human beings just like everyone else, and they are bound to make mistakes and engage in behaviours that may not align with societal norms. It is important for us to accept that imperfection is part of being human and that politicians, like anyone else, deserve our forgiveness and understanding.

Of course, that does not mean that politicians should be above reproach or held immune from accountability for their actions. If someone engages in abusive behaviour or violates the law, they should face consequences, regardless of their status or profession. But we must also remember that people are complex creatures and cannot be reduced to simple labels or judgements based on their personal choices.

So, while the affair involving the MP and his spouse will no doubt leave a lasting impact on the political landscape, it also serves as a reminder that perfection is unattainable. We must learn to accept each other's flaws and weaknesses and focus on what truly matters: working together to create a better future for ourselves and generations to come.",mistral7b,1

The Lib Dems have accused Labour of breaking electoral law by using its call centre staff to contact voters who are registered under 'opt-out' rules, which prevent them from receiving unsolicited sales and promotional calls. In response to this claim, the Information Commissioner has been tasked with conducting an investigation into the matter. This move comes after months of complaints from the Liberal Democrats about Labour's call centre practices.

According to the Lib Dems, Labour has used its call centres to target individuals who have opted out of receiving direct marketing calls. This includes sending text messages, email campaigns, and automated phone calls, all without their consent. They believe that this constitutes a violation of data protection laws and could result in significant fines for the party if proven true.

However, Labour has defended itself against these allegations, claiming that it follows all relevant laws and regulations when making campaign calls. It also points out that many political parties use similar techniques to reach potential voters, arguing that it is simply part of modern electioneering tactics. Nevertheless, the controversy has raised important questions about how far politicians can go when trying to win over voters, particularly those who are most vulnerable or at risk of being exploited.

As the investigation continues, the Information Commissioner will examine the evidence presented by both sides to determine whether there has been any wrongdoing on the part of Labour. If the findings support the allegations made by the Lib Dems, then the party could face serious consequences, including legal action, reputational damage, and even loss of public trust. However, if the ICO determines that Labour did nothing illegal, then the issue will likely fade away into obscurity.

Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, one thing is clear - the issue of telemarketing and voter contact remains a hotly contested topic in UK politics. While the majority of parties agree that such efforts are essential for reaching out to voters, many are concerned about the impact they may have on privacy and autonomy. As such, it is crucial that any future policies or guidelines governing voter contact are carefully crafted, taking into account the concerns and rights of individuals as well as the needs of political campaigns.

Meanwhile, the ongoing debate over voter contact has sparked renewed interest in alternative methods of engagement, including social media and online advertising. Some experts predict that these forms of communication will become increasingly prominent in future elections, as they offer greater flexibility and precision in reaching target audiences. For example, political parties can tailor their messaging to specific demographics based on factors such as age, location, interests, and voting history, potentially allowing them to more effectively sway undecided voters.

Of course, this raises new ethical and legal issues that must be addressed, especially when it comes to issues like data protection and privacy. As technology evolves, so too does the need for robust safeguards to ensure that individual freedoms and rights are respected. Ultimately, any successful strategy for voter engagement in the digital era will require careful consideration of these challenges and a commitment to responsible stewardship of personal information.

While the current focus on call centre practices and voter contact is just one aspect of a wider debate surrounding data protection and privacy in UK politics, it highlights the importance of ensuring that our democratic processes remain transparent, fair, and respectful of individual rights. Whether through traditional methods like door knocking and telephone calls or newer technologies such as social media and targeted advertising, it is vital that we continue to explore ways to engage with voters while protecting their privacy and maintaining trust in our institutions.",mistral7b,1

Political Scandal: Conservative Party Candidate Ineligible for Election

The conservative party is facing a political scandal as it has been revealed that their candidate for Arundel and South Downs, Nick Flite, is not eligible to run for election. This news comes despite claims from his supporters that he had sufficient backing to hold a meeting to discuss his future within the party.

According to Russell Tanguay, an agent for the Arundel and South Downs Tories, Flite does not meet the necessary qualifications to stand as a candidate for the upcoming general election. Tanguay stated that the association was actively searching for a replacement for Flite, who had previously expressed his desire to continue representing the area.

Despite this revelation, Flite's allies have insisted that they have gathered enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his future within the party. They argue that Flite remains popular among voters and should be given another opportunity to represent the community. However, these efforts may ultimately prove futile as Flite's eligibility issues cannot be ignored or resolved easily.

This latest development has sparked outrage from opposition parties, who are calling on the conservative party to act quickly and transparently regarding Flite's status as a candidate. Some have accused the party of trying to cover up Flite's ineligibility in order to maintain their majority in the area. The Conservatives, however, deny any wrongdoing and claim that the issue was simply an administrative mistake.

As the election approaches, the conservative party will need to address this matter head-on and provide clarity on Flite's candidacy. Failing to do so could result in a loss of trust among voters, who rely on the party to act in their best interests. It is also possible that the party may face legal challenges if they attempt to field an ineligible candidate.

In other political news, tensions between the UK government and EU member states continue to escalate over Brexit negotiations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently made a controversial statement suggesting that the UK would leave the European Union without a deal if necessary. This comment angered many EU leaders, who have warned that such a move would lead to devastating economic consequences for both sides.

Meanwhile, the US presidential race continues to heat up as candidates prepare for the first primary debates. Democratic hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have emerged as strong contenders, challenging frontrunner Joe Biden on issues such as healthcare reform and income inequality. Republicans Donald Trump and Pete Buttigieg have also been active in recent days, campaigning across key battleground states.

Overall, this week has been marked by significant developments in the world of politics. From the ongoing debate surrounding Flite's eligibility to the growing tension between the UK and EU, there is no shortage of important stories to follow closely. As we approach the end of the week, it will be interesting to see how these events unfold and what impact they may have on global affairs.",mistral7b,1

Lord Callaghan: A Political Pioneer Leaves Behind Legacy

Former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson passed away peacefully in his East Sussex home on Monday morning. The beloved politician was 96 years old and had been ill for several weeks leading up to his death. He is survived by his son, David Wilson, and two daughters, Sarah and Catherine.

Wilson's passing marked the end of an era for British politics as he held office from 1964 to 1970 and was widely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the post-war period. During his time as prime minister, Wilson oversaw significant economic reforms, including the introduction of decimal coinage, which revolutionized trade and commerce in Britain.

Aside from his political achievements, Wilson also played a pivotal role in the development of television technology, serving as chairman of ITV from 1953 to 1973. His work laid the foundation for the modern TV industry and helped bring entertainment into homes across the country.

In recent years, Wilson has become increasingly known for his contributions to the arts, particularly his support of contemporary music and film. He founded the prestigious Royal Film Society and served as its president until his death in 2004.

However, Wilson's legacy extends far beyond his accomplishments in government and business. As a lifelong socialist, he was deeply committed to improving people's lives through education, healthcare, and other progressive policies. Throughout his career, he fought tirelessly against inequality and advocated for greater equality in society.

Despite his many successes, Wilson faced criticism during his lifetime for being too focused on winning elections rather than addressing the underlying issues facing the country. However, those close to him remember him fondly as a kind and compassionate man who always put others before himself.

The world of British politics is mourning the loss of a true icon in Harold Wilson. From his early days as a student leader to his tenure as prime minister, Wilson left an indelible mark on the nation and inspired generations of politicians who followed in his footsteps.

Callaghan's Death Shocks Politics World

Just over a week after his wife Audrey died aged 91, another well-known figure in British politics, Lord Callaghan, passed away peacefully in his East Sussex home. At age 95, Callaghan was the longest-living former British premier in history. He leaves behind a daughter, Elizabeth Callaghan, and three sons, Andrew, James, and Peter.

A prominent member of the Labour Party, Callaghan served as prime minister from 1976 to 1980 and led the party through several major events, including the Falklands War and the Montague Report, which recommended sweeping changes to the UK steel industry.

During his time in office, Callaghan oversaw significant economic reforms and helped establish the UK as a key player in global affairs. However, he also faced criticism for not doing enough to address the growing threat of terrorism in the wake of IRA attacks in Northern Ireland.

Like Wilson, Callaghan's life extended far beyond his political career. He was a prolific writer, publishing numerous books throughout his career, and was also a passionate advocate for human rights and environmental causes. In later years, he became increasingly involved in the field of biotechnology and worked closely with scientists to develop new treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.

Throughout his long and distinguished life, Callaghan remained a steadfast champion of social justice and progress, earning him the respect and admiration of millions around the world. His death marks yet another chapter in the storied history of British politics.",mistral7b,1

Another political development is coming to a head as Prime Minister Tony Blair prepares to call an early election. According to reports, Mr Blair plans to speak with Queen Elizabeth II next month and ask her to dissolve Parliament, which would trigger a new general election. The date of this announcement is still uncertain, but it is expected to take place between April 4th and 5th. This move comes after months of speculation about the possibility of a snap poll, and it's clear that Mr Blair wants to make use of the momentum his party has gained since the Iraq War began.
The Labour Party has been riding high in recent polls, and many experts believe they are well-positioned to win another term in office. However, the decision to hold an early election may also be seen as a way for Mr Blair to avoid facing criticism over his handling of the ongoing conflict in Iraq. Whatever the reasons behind the move, it's certain that the political landscape will be transformed by this major development.
As the date of the election draws nearer, all parties are stepping up their campaigning efforts. The Conservatives, who were hit hard by the war, are fighting to rebuild public confidence and restore trust with voters. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are seeking to capitalize on their growing popularity among young people and those disillusioned with traditional politics. With just weeks to go before the vote, it promises to be an exciting and unpredictable race.",mistral7b,1

""Alan Johnson has denied rumours that Gordon Brown could replace Peter Mandelson as Labour's business secretary next year. Work and Pensions Minister Johnson told BBC Radio Five Live: ""It is not true that I have any knowledge of anything like that happening at all.""

He added that he had spoken to Mr Brown earlier today and there were no plans for him to leave his role. Johnson also said that the government was committed to supporting its businesses through tough economic times.

The Independent on Sunday reported that Mr Brown had been offered the job of running Labour's election campaign but turned it down due to concerns over his ability to lead from the front. The paper claims that he is instead focusing on developing his own policies and working closely with other members of the cabinet.

Meanwhile, the Mail on Sunday reports that the prime minister has appointed Ed Balls to head up a new education taskforce. Balls, who previously served as school standards minister under Mr Brown, will work alongside former home secretary Jacqui Smith in a bid to improve the quality of teaching in the UK's schools.",mistral7b,1

Title: Poll Shows Low Trust In Politicians Ahead Of Elections As Foreign Sec Predicts Key Choice

The results of a recent poll have shown that only 13% of respondents believe that politicians delivered on their promises, while 87% said otherwise. This is concerning, as it suggests that the public is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the political establishment ahead of upcoming elections. And just this week, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has predicted that ""trust will be the key choice"" at the next election, further highlighting the need for politicians to regain the confidence of voters.

This latest survey was conducted by ICM for BBC News 24 and asked 1,000 adults across the UK about their views on the government's performance. While some may argue that these figures are simply an indication of people's cynicism towards politicians, others suggest that there may be more substance to them than meets the eye.

It is certainly true that over recent years, we have seen many examples of failed promises made by those in power. From the Iraq War to the financial crisis to Brexit - all of these issues have left many people feeling like politicians have let them down. But it could also be argued that this is due to factors beyond politicians' control. For instance, no one could have anticipated the full extent of the financial crash or the ongoing difficulties faced by our economy.

However, regardless of whether the reasons behind broken promises lie within or outside of politicians' hands, there can be little doubt that trust is becoming harder to come by in today's political climate. And this is particularly problematic given the fact that trust is essential if governments hope to implement effective policies and achieve their desired outcomes. After all, without the support of the public, even the most well-intentioned initiatives are likely to fail.

So what does all of this mean for the future of British politics? It seems clear that politicians will need to do everything in their power to rebuild trust among the electorate if they want to stand any chance of success at the ballot box. Whether this means taking a more conciliatory approach to controversial issues like immigration or offering concrete solutions to economic challenges remains to be seen.

What is certain, however, is that the days when politicians could simply take voter support for granted are long gone. With so much uncertainty surrounding the world we live in, the electorate is now looking for leaders who can inspire confidence and provide real answers to their problems. Failure to do so could lead to significant consequences for both the ruling party and the broader political landscape in Britain.",mistral7b,1

In an unexpected turn of events, Danny Kruger has announced that he will not be running for the seat in Sedgefield against former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This decision comes after a controversial comment made by Kruger during a debate last week, which sparked outrage among many. Despite insisting that his remarks were taken out of context and misrepresented, Kruger has decided that it is not worth risking further damage to the Conservative cause by continuing with his campaign.

This decision will likely come as a relief to many within the Tory party who have expressed concern about the potential backlash from Kruger's comments. The controversy surrounding the comment began when Kruger suggested that Blair should be held accountable for the deaths of Iraqi civilians, which led to accusations of victim-blaming and calls for him to apologize. Although Kruger did attempt to clarify his position later in the week, it seemed that his initial statement would continue to haunt him throughout the rest of his campaign.

The withdrawal of Kruger from the race in Sedgefield leaves the field open for other candidates to compete for the seat. It remains to be seen whether the Tories will be able to mount a strong challenge without him, but they will certainly need to focus on issues other than his controversial past if they are going to make headway in this key swing seat.",mistral7b,1

Politics is an ever-changing field, with new developments and debates arising every day. In recent news, the topic of abortion has once again come under the spotlight, with Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman setting out his views on the issue. This comes after the top Catholic in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, supported Michael Howard's stance on reducing the legal limit for abortions.

In an interview with BBC Radio Four's Sunday programme, the cardinal stated that he believes there should be a reduction in the legal limit from the current 24 weeks to 20 weeks. He also criticised the government's stance on the issue, calling it ""tantamount to abortion on demand"". This statement sparked controversy and debate within the political world, as well as among religious leaders.

Michael Howard has long been an advocate for stricter abortion laws, arguing that the current limits are too lenient and lead to too many unborn babies being killed. He has called for a complete ban on abortion, but this position has been met with opposition from many pro-choice advocates who argue that women have the right to make their own choices regarding their bodies and reproductive health.

Tony Blair has previously expressed his support for a reduction in the legal limit, stating that he wants to see fewer abortions take place. However, he has stopped short of supporting a total ban, instead opting for a more moderate approach. His spokesman recently clarified his stance on the issue, stating that the prime minister believes that while women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, this choice should not come at the expense of innocent human life.

This latest development in the abortion debate highlights the complex and divisive nature of the issue. While some people believe that a woman's rights must always trump any concerns for the unborn, others feel that there should be greater restrictions on abortion to protect the sanctity of life. As politicians continue to grapple with this issue, it will likely remain a contentious topic in the years to come.",mistral7b,1

UK appoints Mr Boateng as High Commissioner to South Africa

The United Kingdom has announced the appointment of Sir Peter Boateng as its High Commissioner to South Africa. The former UK cabinet minister and current Lord Boateng will replace Nigel Parker who stepped down earlier this year after serving five years in the position.

Boateng, a Ghanaian-born Briton, was the UK's first black cabinet minister when he was appointed home secretary in 2002. During his tenure, he oversaw a number of major policy changes, including the introduction of identity cards for all UK citizens.

In recent years, he has continued to play an active role in political life, working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on issues such as immigration reform and crime reduction.

""Sir Peter Boateng is an outstanding individual who will be a valuable asset to our country,"" said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. ""He brings a wealth of experience and expertise to his new role, and I have no doubt that he will make an excellent ambassador for the UK in South Africa.""

South Africa's foreign ministry welcomed the news of Boateng's appointment, expressing its commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries.

""We look forward to engaging with him on key areas of mutual interest, including economic cooperation, security and regional stability,"" said International Relations Minister Naledi Pandora.

Boateng's appointment comes at a time of growing tension between the UK and South Africa over issues such as Brexit and trade. However, both sides are keen to maintain strong relations and work together to promote peace and prosperity in Africa.

As one of the continent's largest economies, South Africa plays a vital role in shaping global affairs and is seen by many as a key partner for the UK in the coming decades.

With his extensive background in government and diplomacy, Boateng is well placed to help bridge any gaps between the two nations and foster greater understanding and cooperation.

His arrival in Pretoria is likely to spark renewed interest in British politics among South Africans, many of whom have followed his career closely since his rise to prominence more than a decade ago.

It remains to be seen what impact Boateng will have on bilateral relations, but there is little doubt that his presence will add another layer of complexity to already intricate negotiations between the UK and South Africa.",mistral7b,1

The Conservative Party is set to hold its spring forum this weekend, with the main focus being on the upcoming general election. As they enter into the event, the party is determined to stress the importance of their policies and how they differ from those of Labour. The Conservatives believe that they offer voters a clear alternative to Tony Blair's Labour Party, with an emphasis on reducing taxes and increasing spending for schools and hospitals.

During the opening speech at the forum, Tory Co-Chairman Liam Fox took aim at Tony Blair's legacy. He accused the former Prime Minister of failing to address key issues such as immigration and crime, while also attacking his handling of the Iraq War. Fox argued that the current economic situation was due to years of mismanagement by Labour, and urged voters to reject them in favour of the Conservatives.

While the Conservative Party remains confident in its ability to win the upcoming election, there have been concerns raised over recent polling data. Some experts predict that Labour will retain power with a slim majority, despite the party's poor performance in the last few years. This has led to calls within the Conservative Party to refine its messaging and strategy in order to appeal more widely to voters.

Despite these challenges, many members of the Conservative Party are optimistic heading into the spring forum. They believe that the party's strong record of economic growth and job creation, combined with a clear message of change, will be enough to secure victory at the ballot box. With only months left before the general election, it remains to be seen whether the party can successfully navigate the complex political landscape and emerge victorious in May.",mistral7b,1

Mr Sayeed's re-election came amid mounting tensions within the Conservative Party, as rival factions vied for control and influence on Brexit negotiations. Some Tory MPs had been pushing for a vote against him due to concerns over his close links to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his perceived role in influencing government policy. However, it appears that these efforts were unsuccessful, and Mr Sayeed has now been given a mandate to continue serving as the representative for Mid-Bedfordshire until at least 2025.

Despite facing criticism and calls for his resignation following the allegations made about his tourism business, Mr Sayeed remains popular among many of his constituents who value his strong local representation and commitment to their communities. He is also seen by some as a staunchly pro-Brexit politician, which could have played a role in securing his victory in this closely watched election. As the UK continues its departure from the EU, the political landscape will likely remain volatile, with further developments expected in coming weeks and months.

Meanwhile, Mr Sayeed's win marks another victory for the ruling Conservatives, who have faced increasing scrutiny and pressure in recent years over issues such as immigration, healthcare, and economic inequality. With no clear opposition party in sight, the Tories look set to stay in power for at least another five years, potentially giving them more time to implement their policies and pursue their agenda. However, they will need to maintain support among voters if they are to achieve any significant reform or progress in key areas such as education, crime, and social welfare.",mistral7b,1

Michael Howard has been accused by many people for being an attack mongrel and using negative language during speeches, but he denies these allegations. During his speech at the Tories' annual conference in Brighton, Howard took aim at Peter Hain's comments and delivered a scathing response. He claimed that such personal attacks were evidence of Labor's desperation and fear of losing power.



Howard's speech drew applause from many attendees who saw it as a powerful statement of intent. They cheered as he outlined his vision for Britain, which included lower taxes, increased funding for education, and stronger national security.



However, not everyone was impressed with Howard's message. Some members of the media criticized him for his aggressive tone and lack of substance. Others questioned whether he was truly capable of delivering on his promises, given his track record of making controversial statements and flip-flops over the years.



Despite the criticism, however, Howard remained undeterred. He argued that his policies would bring real change to the UK and help working-class families achieve their dreams. He also pointed out that he had already proven himself as a successful leader, having served as home secretary under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.



Meanwhile, opposition leaders continued to attack Howard for his past mistakes and question his judgment. In particular, they highlighted his role in the Iraq War and his support for George W. Bush's administration.



They accused Howard of blindly following Bush without considering the consequences of his actions. They warned that if Howard became prime minister again, he could lead the country down a dangerous path towards war and instability.



However, Howard dismissed these accusations as baseless and politically motivated. He said he had always stood up for what he believed was right, even when it was unpopular or difficult.



As the debate raged on, it seemed clear that this election would be more than just a battle between two political parties. It was also a clash of ideologies, values, and visions for the future of the UK.



In conclusion, Michael Howard's speech at the Tories' annual conference in Brighton was both a triumph and a testament to his resilience and determination to succeed. Whether he is able to overcome the challenges ahead remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: this election will go down in history as a defining moment in British politics.",mistral7b,1

Lib Dems target Conservative MPs
-------------------------------

The Liberal Democrat party announced today its list of targets for the upcoming general election, including several prominent members of the ruling Conservative Party. Mr Howard's seat was listed first on the Lib Dems' hit list, followed by other high-profile Tories such as Oliver Letwin, David Davis, and Theresa May. The party's elections chief, Lord Rennard, explained the decision to focus their efforts on these individuals, saying they were seen as particularly vulnerable due to their roles within the government.

"Elections watchdog cautions against introducing cap on political party donations
The elections watchdog has advised against implementing a cap on donations to political parties at this time, citing concerns that imposing such limits may not be necessary. The fear that wealthy donors could potentially influence political decisions through their financial contributions has led to calls for restrictions on the amount that can be donated. However, the watchdog warns that introducing a cap on donations could have unintended consequences and may not effectively address the issue of undue influence in politics. While the concept of limiting donations to political parties is well-intentioned, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact and implications of such a policy before enacting it. The idea of curbing the influence of big donors in politics is a valid concern, but it is essential to find a balance between transparency and accountability in political fundraising. In some cases, imposing a cap on donations may restrict the ability of smaller parties or grassroots movements to effectively participate in the political process. Additionally, implementing a cap on donations could lead to loopholes or unintended consequences that undermine the overall goal of reducing the influence of money in politics. The elections watchdog suggests that alternative measures, such as enhanced transparency requirements and stronger oversight mechanisms, may be more effective in addressing concerns about political donations. By increasing transparency and accountability in the political fundraising process, it may be possible to mitigate the potential for undue influence without imposing arbitrary limits on donations. Ultimately, the decision to introduce a cap on political party donations should be carefully considered and based on a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks and benefits. While the fear of wealthy donors exerting undue influence on political decisions is valid, it is important to ensure that any proposed solutions do not inadvertently hinder the democratic process or restrict the ability of legitimate political actors to engage in the political arena.",gpt,1

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has announced that it will be investigating a complaint filed by the Liberal Democrats concerning Labour's use of call centres to contact voters. The investigation comes amidst growing concerns about the tactics employed by political parties during election campaigns, with a particular focus on the use of unsolicited phone calls to solicit support.

"Decline in Support for Ban on Hunting in the UK
According to a recent poll conducted by Mori for BBC One's Countryfile programme, support for a ban on hunting has decreased in the past six years. The survey of 2,000 adults revealed that less than half of the UK population now supports a ban on hunting, compared to almost two-thirds in 1999. This significant decline in support for a hunting ban suggests a shift in public opinion on the issue. The decrease in support for a ban on hunting is a notable development in the ongoing debate over the ethics and legality of hunting in the UK. The findings of the poll raise questions about the reasons behind this shift in public opinion and the potential implications for the future of hunting legislation in the country. One possible explanation for the decline in support for a hunting ban could be a change in attitudes towards hunting and wildlife conservation. It is possible that more people now view hunting as a legitimate and traditional activity that plays a role in wildlife management. Another factor that may have influenced the decrease in support for a hunting ban is the influence of lobbying and advocacy efforts by hunting organizations. These groups may have successfully swayed public opinion in their favor by highlighting the economic benefits of hunting and the importance of maintaining traditional hunting practices. Additionally, the decline in support for a ban on hunting could be attributed to a lack of awareness or understanding about the impact of hunting on wildlife populations and ecosystems. Without a clear understanding of the consequences of hunting, some individuals may be less likely to support a ban on the practice. The findings of the Mori poll highlight the complexity of the issue of hunting and the diverse perspectives that exist within the UK population. As support for a ban on hunting continues to decline, it will be important for policymakers and conservationists to engage in open and honest discussions about the future of hunting legislation in the country. By considering the various factors that may have influenced the shift in public opinion, stakeholders can work towards finding solutions that balance the interests of hunters, conservationists, and the broader public.",gpt,1

"Rise in Shredding of Official Documents by Civil Servants Ahead of Freedom of Information Act Implementation
According to data collected by the Conservative party, civil servants have significantly increased the shredding of official documents in anticipation of the Freedom of Information Act coming into effect on 1 January. Several government departments have reported a doubling in the number of documents being destroyed in recent months.

A British terror suspect who was held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months is reportedly planning to sue the government. Martin Mubanga has claimed that an MI6 officer was instrumental in his transfer to the US camp in Cuba after he was arrested in Zambia, according to a report in the Observer.

An English hospital has decided to backtrack on its decision to refuse treatment to Welsh patients who have been on waiting lists for more than three months. Hereford County Hospital had initially announced that starting from the new year, Welsh patients waiting for hip and knee operations would be removed from the waiting lists if they had waited longer than three months.

"TUC urges government to enhance protection for employees raising health and safety concerns
The Trade Union Congress (TUC) is calling for a change in legislation to provide greater protection for workers who speak out about health and safety issues in their workplaces. According to the TUC, evidence from employment tribunals indicates that approximately 1,500 individuals, referred to as 'safety whistleblowers,' have been dismissed from their jobs since the year 1999. The TUC is concerned about the lack of safeguarding measures in place for employees who bravely raise concerns about potentially hazardous working conditions. The organization argues that these workers should not face retaliation or termination for prioritizing their safety and that of their colleagues. A spokesperson for the TUC emphasized the importance of creating a supportive environment for employees to report health and safety concerns without fear of repercussions. They highlighted the essential role that whistleblowers play in promoting accountability and preventing workplace accidents. The TUC is urging the government to address this issue promptly and implement reforms to ensure that employees are adequately protected when speaking up about safety risks. The organization is pushing for legal changes that would strengthen the rights of workers who raise health and safety concerns, including provisions for reinstatement and compensation for those who have suffered unfair dismissal. By enhancing legal protections for safety whistleblowers, the TUC believes that employers will be more incentivized to address potential hazards proactively and create safer working environments for their staff. The TUC's call for action comes at a critical time when workplace safety has become a pressing issue due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With the heightened emphasis on health and safety measures in various industries, it is essential to support employees who flag potential risks to prevent accidents and injuries. The TUC's proposal aligns with the broader goal of fostering a culture of transparency and accountability in the workplace. By empowering workers to speak out about safety concerns, companies can proactively identify and mitigate risks before they escalate into serious incidents. The government's response to the TUC's recommendations will be a crucial indicator of its commitment to upholding workers' rights and ensuring occupational safety. As discussions around legislative changes evolve, it is essential for policymakers to prioritize the well-being of employees and prioritize measures that promote a safe and secure working environment for all.",gpt,1
"Top Academic Urges UK and US to Shift Focus from Preventing All Terror Attacks to Preventing Nuclear Strikes
In a recent article, a top academic has urged both the UK and US to shift their focus from trying to prevent all terror attacks to instead focusing on preventing nuclear strikes. Amitai Etzioni, a prominent figure in shaping New Labour policies, believes that the emphasis on an 'Axis of Evil' by the US is misguided. Etzioni argues that it is unrealistic to believe that every single terror attack can be prevented, and that efforts should be directed towards ensuring that they do not escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. He warns that the obsession with preventing all types of attacks can distract from the more critical goal of averting catastrophic nuclear incidents. The academic stresses that while it is important to address security threats, it is equally vital to prioritize measures that can mitigate the risk of a nuclear attack. Etzioni's perspective challenges the prevailing narrative that focuses solely on combating terrorism in all its forms. He suggests that a more nuanced approach is needed to effectively address the complex security challenges faced by both nations. Etzioni's views echo concerns raised by other experts who have questioned the effectiveness of the current counterterrorism strategies employed by the UK and US. The academic's call for a shift in priorities underscores the need for a more strategic and comprehensive approach to national security. By reevaluating their strategies and priorities, both countries can better protect their citizens from the most dire threats, such as the potential use of nuclear weapons. Etzioni's insights offer a fresh perspective on how to address the evolving security landscape and highlight the importance of adapting to meet new and emerging threats. Ultimately, his recommendations urge policymakers to rethink their approach to national security to ensure that efforts are focused on preventing the most catastrophic outcomes, rather than trying to eliminate every possible threat.",gpt,1

They worry that a 'super union' could overshadow smaller unions and limit the representation of marginalized or minority groups within the workforce. Despite the potential challenges, leaders of Amicus and TGWU are optimistic about the benefits of merging and believe that it will strengthen the overall labor movement in the UK. The decision to merge will ultimately be up to the members of both unions, who will need to vote on the proposal before it can be finalized. If the merger is approved, it could reshape the landscape of trade unionism in Britain and set a new precedent for collaboration and solidarity among workers in the country.",gpt,1

"UK Referendum on European Constitution Could Cost £80m
In a recent parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie disclosed that the estimated cost of running a referendum on the European constitution in the UK could be as high as £80 million. This figure is comparable to the cost of a general election, indicating the significant financial resources required to conduct such a large-scale democratic process. The revelation has sparked debate and discussion among politicians and the public about the necessity and feasibility of holding a referendum on this issue. The potential cost of £80 million has raised concerns about the allocation of taxpayer funds and the overall budgetary impact of organizing a referendum. Supporters of a referendum argue that it is essential for citizens to have a say in matters as important as the European constitution. They believe that the potential benefits of a referendum, such as increased democratic participation and transparency, outweigh the financial costs associated with it.

Mr. Straw pointed out that while arms embargoes are in place for countries like China, Burma, and Zimbabwe, they do not extend to North Korea, a nation with a notorious human rights record.

The embargo was initially put in place following China's brutal crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square, a human rights violation that sparked outrage around the world. However, the EU has been considering lifting the embargo for some time now, citing improvements in China's human rights record and the need for closer economic ties. The decision is likely to have significant political implications, as it could strain relations between the EU and the US, who have historically been strong allies. The US has warned that lifting the embargo could potentially strengthen China's military capabilities and pose a threat to regional security. Despite these concerns, it appears that the EU is determined to move forward with the decision. This move highlights the complex and often contentious nature of international politics, as countries navigate their relationships with one another while also considering their own economic interests. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact global dynamics and whether it will lead to further tensions between the EU and the US. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of a changing geopolitical landscape, decisions like these will continue to shape the future of international relations.",gpt,1

"Controversy Surrounds New Law Banning Hunting with Dogs
Critics of the new law banning hunting with dogs claim it is so poorly drafted that the offense cannot even be properly defined, according to pro-hunt MPs. The controversy arose when a man in Devon was given permission to use his four dogs to 'chase away unwanted animals' from his farm, raising questions about the interpretation of the law. The unclear language of the legislation has sparked debate and confusion among both supporters and opponents of the ban. The lack of clarity has left many wondering how exactly the law will be enforced and who will be responsible for determining what constitutes a violation. Pro-hunt MPs argue that the vague wording of the law opens the door for subjective interpretation and potential abuse of power by authorities. They fear that well-intentioned individuals could inadvertently find themselves on the wrong side of the law without a clear understanding of what actions are prohibited. The case in Devon serves as a prime example of the challenges posed by the ambiguous nature of the legislation. The man in question believed he was within his rights to use his dogs to protect his property, only to be confronted with accusations of breaking the law. The situation highlights the need for greater clarity and specificity in the language of the ban to avoid such misunderstandings in the future. Supporters of the ban, on the other hand, argue that the intent of the legislation is clear and that any confusion is simply a result of resistance to change from those who oppose the hunting ban. They believe that the law is necessary to protect wildlife and prevent unnecessary harm to animals, and that any unforeseen issues can be addressed through proper enforcement and oversight. The debate over the hunting ban highlights the challenges of creating effective and enforceable legislation in a complex and contentious issue like animal rights and conservation. As lawmakers grapple with the nuances of the law, it is crucial that all parties work together to ensure that the ban is implemented fairly and effectively.

"New Guidelines Protecting Householders Who Injure Intruders
Householders who harm or even fatally wound intruders will not face prosecution if they acted in a manner that was honest and instinctual, according to new guidelines. Additionally, the law protects individuals who use objects found nearby as improvised weapons. These guidelines aim to provide clarity and reassurance to homeowners who may find themselves in a dangerous situation involving an intruder. The idea behind this approach is to ensure that individuals are able to defend themselves and their property without fear of legal repercussions, as long as their actions are considered reasonable under the circumstances. This shift in policy reflects a recognition of the challenges faced by homeowners who may feel vulnerable and threatened in their own homes. The guidelines are intended to empower individuals to take swift action to protect themselves and their loved ones when faced with an intruder. This approach recognizes that in the heat of the moment, individuals may not have the luxury of carefully considering their actions and may need to act quickly to defend themselves. By providing legal protection to those who act instinctively and honestly in such situations, the guidelines seek to strike a balance between protecting the rights of homeowners and ensuring that intruders are not unduly harmed. While some may argue that these guidelines could potentially encourage vigilantism, proponents of the new policy emphasize that it is crucial for individuals to have the ability to protect themselves in life-threatening situations. They point out that the law already allows for self-defense in cases where individuals fear for their safety, and that these guidelines simply clarify the circumstances under which such actions would be considered lawful. Ultimately, the goal of these guidelines is to ensure that homeowners are not unfairly penalized for acting in self-defense, while also sending a clear message that intruders will face consequences for their actions. This represents a significant shift in how the legal system approaches cases of self-defense involving intruders, and it is likely to have far-reaching implications for both homeowners and intruders alike.",gpt,1

These orders will allow authorities to keep suspects under house arrest even when there is insufficient evidence to prosecute them. Lord Falconer stresses that these measures do not signify a move towards a police state, but rather aim to strike a balance between safeguarding the public from the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. The proposal has sparked debate and controversy, with some expressing concerns about the potential erosion of individual rights and freedoms. However, supporters argue that these control orders are a necessary tool in combating terrorism and ensuring national security. The government maintains that these measures are a response to the evolving threat of terrorism and are in line with international human rights standards. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the control orders could lead to abuse of power and violation of due process rights. Lord Falconer has emphasized that these orders will only be used in cases where there is credible intelligence indicating a significant threat to public safety. He also assures that there will be strict oversight and review mechanisms in place to prevent misuse of the powers. The debate over the government's counter-terrorism measures highlights the delicate balance between security and freedom in a democratic society. It raises important questions about how to effectively combat terrorism without compromising fundamental rights and values. As the government moves forward with its plans to introduce control orders, it will be crucial for policymakers to carefully consider the implications of these measures on individual liberties and the rule of law. Ultimately, the challenge lies in finding a middle ground that protects national security while upholding the principles of justice and human rights. Lord Falconer's defense of the control orders underscores the government's commitment to addressing the threat of terrorism while respecting the rule of law and democratic values.",gpt,1

The decision to separate the judicial functions from the position of lord chancellor marks a significant departure from historical norms and traditions. This move is seen as a necessary step towards ensuring that the individual appointed to this critical role possesses the necessary skills and experience to effectively oversee the administration of justice. The role of lord chancellor has long been associated with legal expertise and political acumen, but the courts minister believes that broader leadership and management skills are equally important in guiding the judiciary towards greater efficiency and accountability. By emphasizing the need for the 'best person for the job' to be appointed as lord chancellor, regardless of their professional background, the government is signaling a commitment to modernizing and improving the functioning of the judiciary system. This reform is expected to open up new opportunities for individuals with diverse skill sets and qualifications to contribute to the administration of justice in the UK. As the government moves forward with these reforms, it is likely that the criteria for selecting the lord chancellor will continue to evolve to reflect changing priorities and values in the realm of governance and administration.",gpt,1

"Tories Call for Delay in Extending Pub Opening Times Amid Binge Drinking Concerns
The Conservatives are calling for a halt in the government's plans to extend pub opening times until the issue of binge drinking is better managed, despite previously supporting a change in the law last year. According to spokesman David Davis, the party was not informed by ministers about the worries expressed by senior police officers regarding the potential increase in anti-social behavior that could result from the proposed extension. The Tories are urging the government to address these concerns before moving forward with the plans. Davis emphasized that the wellbeing of the public should be the top priority when considering changes to alcohol licensing laws. The pushback from the Conservatives comes as a surprise to some, given their previous support for extending pub hours as a way to boost the economy and provide more opportunities for socializing. However, the party's emphasis on public safety and responsible drinking habits is now taking precedence over economic benefits. The debate over extending pub opening times has reignited discussions about the UK's drinking culture and the role of the government in regulating alcohol consumption. Critics argue that longer opening hours could lead to an increase in alcohol-related incidents and strain on emergency services. On the other hand, supporters of the extension argue that it would promote a more relaxed and social drinking environment. The government has yet to respond to the Tories' call for a delay in implementing the proposed changes, leaving the fate of the extended pub hours uncertain. With the issue of binge drinking continuing to be a concern for public health and safety, finding a balance between economic interests and social responsibility remains a challenge for policymakers. The Tories' stance on this issue reflects their commitment to promoting responsible drinking habits and addressing the negative impacts of excessive alcohol consumption on society. As the debate unfolds, it is clear that finding a solution that satisfies all stakeholders will require careful consideration and collaboration among government officials, law enforcement agencies, and public health advocates.",gpt,1

As the debate over the Iraq war legality continues to rage, it is clear that the Attorney General's denial of any improper influence from Downing Street will not be the final word on the matter. The legacy of the Iraq war will continue to haunt British politics for years to come, with questions over the legality, morality, and justification of the conflict still unresolved. The Attorney General's denial of political pressure may provide some measure of closure for those seeking accountability and transparency, but the wounds of the Iraq war are unlikely to heal anytime soon.",gpt,1

The proposal would also include the option of imposing curfews and community service orders on parents who defy court orders to allow parental access.

The Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, has emphasized the importance of including plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months in Labour's election manifesto. She stated that the cost of such proposals is currently being assessed, but it is considered an 'increasingly high priority' and a 'shared goal across government'.

"Education Secretary Ruth Kelly's Religious Views Cause Concern Among Scientists
Scientists have raised worries about the potential impact of Education Secretary Ruth Kelly's religious beliefs on scientific research. Ms Kelly, a devout Catholic, is known to be against embryo research and has expressed pro-life views. There are fears among the scientific community that her stance on these issues could hinder important research and advancements in areas such as genetics and biology. The concern stems from the importance of evidence-based decision making in scientific endeavors, which could be compromised if personal beliefs and ideologies are prioritized over empirical data.

The Law Lords found that these actions targeted a specific ethnic group and violated their human rights. The government's policies have been criticized for unfairly targeting the Roma community and perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by marginalized communities in navigating immigration systems that are often biased and exclusionary.

"UK government scheme to offer online university courses branded a waste by MPs
MPs have criticized a failed government scheme to provide online university courses in the UK, calling it a 'disgraceful waste'. The e-University initiative was abandoned last year after attracting just 900 students, despite costing £50 million. The project, which aimed to offer higher education opportunities through digital platforms, faced heavy criticism for its poor enrollment numbers and high expenditure. Members of Parliament labeled the scheme as a mismanaged and inefficient use of public funds, highlighting the need for greater scrutiny and accountability in government programs. The e-University's closure sparked debates about the effectiveness of online learning initiatives and the role of technology in education. Critics argued that the project failed to deliver on its promises of expanding access to higher education and improving learning outcomes for students.

As calls for transparency and accountability grew louder, politicians and policymakers were forced to address the shortcomings of the failed initiative and consider alternative approaches to promoting digital education. The fallout from the e-University debacle served as a wake-up call for government officials, reminding them of the importance of responsible budgeting and strategic planning in public projects. Moving forward, there was a renewed focus on evaluating the cost-effectiveness and impact of government schemes, with an emphasis on delivering tangible benefits to taxpayers and citizens. The closure of the e-University marked a turning point in the discussion around online education, prompting a reevaluation of the potential risks and rewards associated with digital learning platforms. Despite its shortcomings, the failed initiative sparked important conversations about the future of higher education and the role of technology in shaping academic experiences. As the dust settled on the e-University saga, politicians and educators alike were left to ponder the lessons learned from the costly experiment and consider how best to support innovation and growth in the digital age. The legacy of the e-University would be felt for years to come, serving as a cautionary tale about the perils of hasty decision-making and unchecked spending in the public sector.",gpt,1
"Labour accused of breaking promise on immigration
The Labour party has already come under fire from the Tories for allegedly breaking its pre-election promise on immigration. Before the ink has even dried on its new pledge card, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has reportedly told Labour members that he wants to see an increase in the number of migrants coming to the UK. This revelation has sparked criticism from the Conservative party, with some accusing Labour of being dishonest with voters. The Tories have claimed that this is proof that Labour cannot be trusted to keep its word on important issues like immigration. This latest development is likely to reignite the debate on immigration policy in the UK, with both major parties now at odds over the issue. The controversy also raises questions about the Labour party's credibility and its commitment to delivering on its promises. The timing of this revelation is particularly damaging for Labour, as it comes just weeks after the party unveiled its new pledge card, which included a promise to address concerns about immigration. The fact that Labour has seemingly already backtracked on this promise is likely to erode trust in the party and could have repercussions at the ballot box. It remains to be seen how Labour will respond to these accusations and whether they will stick to their original pledge on immigration. In the meantime, the Tories will undoubtedly continue to use this issue to attack Labour and undermine their credibility with voters. The controversy over immigration policy is just the latest example of the ongoing political battles between the major parties in the UK. With the next general election looming, both Labour and the Tories are keen to score points and win over undecided voters.

"Public Trust in Politicians Hits Record Low
According to a recent poll conducted for the BBC, a staggering eight out of 10 voters do not believe that politicians are truthful. The survey, which questioned 1,000 adults, also revealed that 87% of respondents feel that politicians consistently fail to deliver on their promises. This alarming lack of trust in political leaders highlights a growing disillusionment among the public with the current state of politics.

The findings of this poll serve as a stark reminder that politicians must work harder to regain the trust of the public and restore faith in the political system. If politicians want to rebuild credibility with voters, they must be honest, transparent, and accountable for their actions. Only through genuine efforts to fulfill their promises and prioritize the needs of the people can politicians hope to bridge the growing divide between themselves and the public. Ultimately, it is up to politicians to prove to the electorate that they are worthy of trust and capable of leading with integrity and honesty in order to restore faith in the political process.",gpt,1

"Ministers under scrutiny for Budget leak ahead of Gordon Brown's speech
Ministers are facing intense scrutiny after it was revealed that Budget details were printed in a London newspaper just half an hour before Gordon Brown was set to make his speech. The Tories have accused the government of a significant breach of Treasury confidentiality, claiming that a substantial portion of the Budget seemed to have been leaked. This incident has raised serious concerns about the security and integrity of the Budget process, with opposition parties demanding an explanation from the ministers involved. The leaked information included key details of the Budget such as tax changes, spending allocations, and economic forecasts, prompting accusations of insider trading and unfair advantage for those who had early access to the information. The timing of the leak, just moments before the Chancellor was due to deliver his speech, has added fuel to the fire, with critics questioning how such sensitive information could have been disclosed so close to the official announcement.

"Labour Victory in Next Election Could Lead to National Insurance Increase, Says Tory Leader
In a recent statement, Tory leader Michael Howard has warned that National Insurance rates would be raised if Labour wins the upcoming election.

"Work and Pensions Minister Calls for Retirement Age to be Scrapped
In a bold statement, the work and pensions minister has declared that the myth of ageing being a barrier to contributing to society must be debunked. Alan Johnson stated that the government is currently exploring the possibility of completely eliminating the retirement age. According to Johnson, the idea that individuals become less valuable or productive as they age is outdated and harmful. By removing the retirement age, the government hopes to encourage older individuals to continue working and making meaningful contributions to society. Johnson emphasized the importance of tapping into the wealth of knowledge and experience that older workers possess. He argued that age should not dictate a person's ability to work or participate in society.

Supporters of the proposal argue that age should not be a barrier to entry into politics and that younger MPs can bring new ideas and energy to the table. They believe that giving teenagers the opportunity to serve as MPs will help bridge the generation gap and ensure that the concerns of young people are heard and addressed.

They argue that MPs should have a certain level of maturity, experience, and knowledge before taking on the responsibilities of public office. There are also concerns about the potential impact on the quality of decision-making and governance if younger MPs are elected.

"The War on Terror and the Lack of Public Outrage: A Critique by Amnesty International's Chief
Amnesty International's chief, Irene Khan, recently delivered a lecture at the London School of Economics where she expressed her concerns about the lack of public outrage surrounding the war on terror. Khan argued that human rights have been disregarded in the pursuit of security measures since the tragic events of 9/11. She criticized the failure of human rights groups to generate sufficient public outcry against the erosion of civil liberties in the name of combating terrorism.

Khan's critique serves as a powerful indictment of the international community's failure to hold governments accountable for their actions in the name of fighting terrorism. The lack of public outrage over such violations is a troubling sign of complacency and a lack of awareness about the importance of upholding human rights in times of crisis. Khan's words serve as a call to action for individuals and organizations to speak out against the erosion of civil liberties and the abuse of power in the name of security. The war on terror has had far-reaching consequences for human rights around the world, and it is essential that we challenge these violations and hold governments accountable for their actions. Amnesty International's chief has issued a stark warning about the dangers of prioritizing security over human rights, urging the international community to take action before it is too late.

"The Misguided Comparison of Blair and Brown to Squabbling School Kids
It has become a common narrative to compare Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to squabbling school children, suggesting that they and their supporters need to mature and cease their bickering. However, this analysis is fundamentally flawed. While it may be easy to draw parallels between the disagreements and tensions within the Labour Party during the Blair-Brown era to petty arguments on the playground, the reality is far more complex. The relationship between Blair and Brown was not simply a matter of childish disputes, but rather a reflection of deep ideological and strategic differences.

The comparison to squabbling school kids oversimplifies the complexities of political leadership and decision-making. It undermines the seriousness of the issues at hand and diminishes the significance of the policy debates that divided the party during their respective tenures.

The challenges faced by Blair and Brown were not trivial matters to be brushed off as playground antics. They were weighty questions with real consequences for the future of the party and the country as a whole. The calls for Blair and Brown to 'grow up' and 'stop bickering' fail to recognize the legitimate differences of opinion that existed between them. It is important to acknowledge that their disagreements were rooted in genuine convictions and beliefs, rather than mere childish stubbornness.

Moving forward, it is crucial for the Labour Party and its supporters to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue that addresses the substantive issues facing the party and the nation. This requires a willingness to grapple with complex and contentious issues, rather than resorting to dismissive characterizations that oversimplify the challenges of political leadership.

She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. ""We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400."" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: ""These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.""

She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: ""While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected."" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.

Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be ""crippled"" by the move. ""While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,"" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.

"Watchdog probes e-mail deletions

The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.

Richard Thomas ""totally condemned"" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served ""no current purpose"", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.

Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was ""too unlikely to have been a coincidence"", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or ""the destruction of important records"". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the ""e-mail regime"" could ""support the freedom of information regime"".

Mr Thomas said: ""The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence."" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.

""If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. ""But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned."" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.

"Hewitt decries 'career sexism'

Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.

Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an ""increasingly high priority"" and a ""shared goal across government"". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: ""Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. ""We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.""

Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and ""taster courses"" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).

The minister told delegates that getting rid of ""career sexism"" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.

""Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. ""It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,"" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. ""Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. ""Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. ""But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.""

She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. ""The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p."" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.

It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of ""natural differences"" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.

"Labour chooses Manchester

The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.

The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.

For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.

Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: ""We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. ""Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. ""It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country."" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.

"Brown ally rejects Budget spree

Chancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.

Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.

Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - ""with a margin to spare"". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.

He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. ""If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,"" he told a Parliamentary lunch. ""This is a big change in our political culture.""

During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. ""I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,"" he said.

His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: ""Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering."" Sir Digby added: ""I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. ""We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. ""That would be a good way to spend any excess.""

Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. ""I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,"" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.

"'Errors' doomed first Dome sale

The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.

The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.

The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. ""Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,"" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: ""This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled."" He added: ""Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt."" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: ""In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.""

"Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies'

Tony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories.

Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a ""hard right agenda"". Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.

The prime minister ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.

In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: ""I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street."" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and ""throwing crockery"". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: ""It's a fight for the future of our country, it's a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.""

Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in ""a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward"". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies. ""What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,"" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. ""We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,"" he said, insisting he enjoyed a ""warm and constructive"" relationship to Lord Ashcroft.

Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay. He said: ""This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. ""In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales."" The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a ""touchy-feely"" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.

"Women MPs reveal sexist taunts

Women MPs endure ""shocking"" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.

Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered ""melons"" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study ""Whose Secretary are You, minister"".

The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called ""Blair Babes"" elected in 1997, told researchers: ""I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke."" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women ""Betty"".

""When I said, 'Look you know my name isn't Betty', he said, 'ah but you're all the same, so I call you all Betty'."" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: ""Well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman."" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: ""Oh, you've had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?"" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.

Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: ""Lots of people say it's like an old boys club. ""I've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers."" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. ""We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes."" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to ""put up with"" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: ""Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. ""What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons."" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.

"Campbell: E-mail row 'silly fuss'

Ex-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists.

Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2's Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour's controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a ""silly fuss"". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign.

The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from ""demonising"" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.

Mr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: ""Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!"" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.

He said: ""Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. ""Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. ""Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. ""Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.""

Later the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell's use of abusive language. The spokesman said: ""The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government."" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had ""very good and polite relations"" with Mr Campbell, who he described as ""very talented"". But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: ""I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists."" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new ""sinister and underhand tactics"" by Labour.

"Crucial decision on super-casinos

A decision on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament.

The government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow. Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close.

The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.

"Mrs Howard gets key election role

Michael Howard's ex-model wife, Sandra, is to play a leading role in the Conservative election campaign.

Mrs Howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail criss-crossing the country. Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said. ""We want Michael to be as accessible as possible,"" Mr Fox said, adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny.

The Tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, Mr Fox said. Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign. But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.

Mr Fox responded by accusing the prime minister of ""hiding away from the scrutiny of London's media"". The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy. On Mrs Howard's role, Mr Fox said: ""Sandra has already been campaigning with Michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. ""That pattern will continue. It's worked very well up until now."" Mrs Howard made her debut speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth last October. She used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity, Addaction, which she supports. Mrs Howard has also appeared along side her husband on TV chat shows. During an interview on ITV1's This Morning she said she often criticised her husband for not showing the side of him that she knows.

"PM apology over jailings

Tony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.

The prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: ""I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice."" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved ""to be completely and publicly exonerated"".

The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with ""such sincerity"", adding: ""He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. ""You could see he was moved by what people were saying. ""Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It's a day I never thought would come."" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would ""ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them"".

Most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a ""wonderful feeling"" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.

""The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,"" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.

"Howard rebuts asylum criticisms

Tory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.

Mr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would ""like to kick your cat"". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was ""much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover"" - although she denied having personal experience. ""I wasn't at Cambridge - and it's not personal experience - but I know people who were.""

Documentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.

He replies: ""What is the inference of that? ""That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? ""That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.""

Ms Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major's government. ""I used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian."" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls ""good fun"", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: ""Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it's quite fun.""

Former Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour's election campaign, says a ""touchy-feely"" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a ""big strategy"", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as ""absolutely rubbish"", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is ""conceivable"" it could win the next election. But he adds: ""It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.""

- Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.

"Blair rejects Tory terror offer

Tony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.

The Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.

The government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.

Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.

The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four's the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a ""recruiting sergeant"" for terrorists. He went on to say: ""If we don't get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill."" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be ""far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through"". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.

The second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by ""an eminent and independent person"". ""I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,"" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months."" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a ""basic principle"" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: ""Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.""

"Talks held on Gibraltar's future

Two days of talks on the future of Gibraltar begin at Jack Straw's country residence later on Wednesday.

Officials at the two-day summit at the foreign secretary's official Kent house, Chevening, will plan a new forum on the Rock's future. In October, Mr Straw and his Spanish counterpart Miguel Moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give Gibraltarians a voice in their future. Most Gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain British.

Gibraltar's Chief Minister Peter Caruana will represent the British citizens living on the Rock, while Britain's Europe Director Dominick Chilcott will represent the UK. Madrid is being represented by Spain's director general for Europe, Jose Maria Pons. The initiative follows Spain's socialist government's decision to put its long-standing sovereignty ambitions on hold. Gibraltarians rejected plans for the Rock's sovereignty to be shared between Britain and Spain in a referendum organised by Gibraltar government.

"Crisis 'ahead in social sciences'

A national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up, a committee of MPs has said.

There was an ""absolute crisis"" in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts, the Commons science and technology committee added. ""Major problems"" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said. The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.

The council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. In its report on the council's work the committee said: ""We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. This mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry, it said. ""It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council's limited resources. ""If the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this."" A national ""strategic capabilities fund"" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.

"Tsunami debt deal to be announced

Chancellor Gordon Brown has said he hopes to announce a deal to suspend debt interest repayments by tsunami-hit nations later on Friday.

The agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries £3bn pounds a year, he said. The deal is thought to have been hammered out on Thursday night after Japan, one of the biggest creditor nations, finally signed up to it. Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week.

G8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster. Mr Brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the G8, which Britain now chairs. Germany also proposed a freeze and Canada has begun its own moratorium. The expected deal comes as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the number of Britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached 440.

"Straw to attend Auschwitz service

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will visit Auschwitz for the 60th anniversary of the former Nazi concentration camp's liberation, it has been announced.

Prince Edward will also join the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz. The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been ""shamed"" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: ""I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. ""Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.""

In Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James's Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen's grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself ""the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear"", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.

"Drink remark 'acts as diversion'

The first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk ""once in a while"" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.

Jack Law, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said Jack McConnell's comment was ""ill-advised"". The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been ""obscured"" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.

The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were ""a recognition that people will get drunk"". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: ""I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. ""If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it."" However, he added that ""perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage"".

Mr MacDonell said: ""I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. ""But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured."" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: ""I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.

""We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. ""This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness."" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were ""off the mark"", they were bound to ""come back and bite him"". He added: ""Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. ""I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.""

The Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ""ill-judged comment"" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: ""It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. ""That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.""

"Concerns at school diploma plan

Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.

The government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. ""It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,"" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.

His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. ""We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,"" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. ""It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak."" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to ""compromise"". The QCA said the potential ""step-change in participation and attainment"" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. ""Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,"" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not ""close too many doors"" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.

The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. ""One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,"" he said. ""If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity."" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in ""functional"" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a ""massive upheaval"". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.

"Blair backs 'pre-election budget'

Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.

In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.

""That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of Labour's programme.

In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"".

""In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: ""He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We're not so sure."" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: ""His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic. ""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.""

Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. ""In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election."" Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using ""fancy statistics"" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his ""golden rule"". ""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Mr Cable told MPs.

"Nat Insurance to rise, say Tories

National Insurance will be raised if Labour wins the next election, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed.

Tony Blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on Wednesday said other tax promises would be left to Labour's manifesto. Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.

The Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. The Tories have promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an £11bn gap in its spending plans. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: ""Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?""

Mr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. ""When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,"" he said. On the tax questions, he added: ""We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto."" Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.

Mr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. The prime minister ridiculed the Tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a ""fantasy island"". Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU. But Mr Blair said: ""All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN.""

"E-University 'disgraceful waste'

A failed government scheme to offer UK university courses online has been branded a ""disgraceful waste"" by MPs.

The e-University was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of £50m. Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of £44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. The Commons education select committee called this ""morally indefensible"" but the government said the e-University project had ""improved understanding"".

A Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said the venture had been ""ambitious and ground-breaking, but take-up had not been ""sufficient to continue with the project"". She added: ""UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom."" The select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-University in 2000 had been caught up in the ""general atmosphere of enthusiasm"" surrounding the internet. Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least £110m in profit.

But virtually no market research was carried out and just £4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. Some £14m went on developing the technology to make the e-University work. This was used by just 200 students, the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had ""too much freedom to spend public money as it wished"", the report found. Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: ""UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money. ""The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme."" The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but ""should learn the lessons from this disaster"".

"Brown visits slum on Africa trip

Chancellor Gordon Brown has visited Kenya's biggest shantytown as he opened a week-long visit to Africa.

Mr Brown's trip is designed to highlight how the UK wants to make Africa's problems a priority of its chairmanship of the G8 this year. He will see an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town. At slums in Narobi on Wednesday, he said education needs had to be tackled.

Speaking outside the Olympic Primary School, Mr Brown said: ""It is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education."" He pointed to international plans to invest $10bn for education in Africa over the next decade. The school is on the edge of Kibera, where 800,000 live often in huts made of mud, scrap metal and cardboard. Mr Brown's aides say he wants to find out more about the Kenyan Government's education policies, which included introducing free primary education in early 2003. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two. The trip follows claims of infighting between Mr Brown and Tony Blair detailed in a new book. Conservative leader Michael Howard is expected to seize on those reports at prime minister's questions at 1200 GMT on Wednesday.

"UK 'needs true immigration data'

A former Home Office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor UK immigration.

Barbara Roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. She said this would counter ""so-called independent"" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate. He says he opposes large-scale immigration ""both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture"".

He said: ""For example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. ""We are already more overcrowded than India and we are four times more overcrowded than France."" Ms Roche, Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. She said her proposals mean ""we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view."" She went on: ""What I would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government. ""I think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.""

"Blair sets date for Africa report

The Commission for Africa's report will be released on 11 March - Comic Relief day, Tony Blair has said.

July's G8 summit in Gleneagles in Perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on Africa. The announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer Bob Geldof - in London. As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa. Mr Blair told a news conference: ""It will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. ""It's an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it.""

Mr Blair has vowed to put Africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the G8. He acknowledged he would have a ""a job of persuading to do"" on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief. Bob Geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for Africa. The former rock star's presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands. The people involved include two African government leaders and a range of other African politicians, as well as experts from some other developed countries.

"Butler launches attack on Blair

Former civil service chief Lord Butler has criticised the way Tony Blair's government operates, accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.

He also attacked the way the Iraq war was ""sold"" to the public, with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the ""most damaging testimony"" he could remember. But Downing Street said Mr Blair should be judged by results not his style.

Lord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. The prime minister's official spokesman said the Cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. But he added: ""You cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in Cabinet. It's just not possible.""

Lord Butler said the government had too much freedom to ""bring in bad Bills"" and ""to do whatever it likes"" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. The former cabinet secretary said in an interview with The Spectator magazine: ""I would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what I would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments."" Mr Howard described Lord Butler's intervention as ""very important"". ""This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government. ""It is certainly the most damaging testimony I can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.""

Lord Butler's report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government's September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was ""very thin"". The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson. He said: ""When civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we've drawn, but we've got to tell you the evidence we've got is pretty thin. ""Similarly, if you are giving something to the United Nations and the country you should warn them.""

Asked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: ""One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.""

When asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: ""Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. ""We should be breaking away from the party whip. The executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad Bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. ""All that is part of what is bad government in this country."" Lord Butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong. Lord Armstrong told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""I agree ... there doesn't appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler's comments were ""well justified"" and Mr Blair's style of leadership was ""corrosive of the whole system of government"". But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Taken together, Robin Butler's comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government.""

"Lib Dems demand new inquiry

A judge should look into the David Blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the Lib Dems say.

Sir Alan Budd's inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover's nanny. But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. He told BBC News: ""I'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. ""That must be bad for government, it must be bad for public confidence in the system.""

Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. He said: ""There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that. ""So we do need to understand what took place and who was involved."" The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged. But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.

"UK set to cut back on embassies

Nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has announced.

The Bahamas, East Timor, Madagascar and Swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shake-up for the diplomatic service for years. Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. Mr Straw said the move would save £6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.

Honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. Nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed, mostly in Europe and America.

They include Dallas in the US, Bordeaux in France and Oporto in Portugal, with local staff replacing UK representation in another 11. The changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. Some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. In a written statement, Mr Straw said: ""The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. ""Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. ""In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.""

The Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff. It has opened major new missions on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. Since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding Wednesday's cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. The shake-up is aimed at helping making £86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. ""But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,"" he said.

"Labour targets 'hardcore truants'

A fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.

Serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. Parenting contracts, penalty notices and ""fast track"" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. Tories say Labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school. Such absences are often due to family holidays.

However, serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing £885m. Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved. The tough stance paid off with just 24 issued, while attendance improved in 776 cases. Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's Behaviour Improvement Programme. This is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since September.

The new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on Monday. Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school. In almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. A Department for Education and Skills source said: ""Every day in school counts. ""It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy.""

"Blunkett sorry over murder plan

David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced ""prematurely"" via press release a review of murder laws.

The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"". He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.

On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his ""gracious apology"" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be ""dragged"" to face MPs.

In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be ""graded"" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.

But the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was ""indefensible and should cease"".

A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: ""Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. ""Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence."" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.

"Hunt demo at Labour meeting

Pro-hunt supporters are set to protest at Labour's spring conference.

The Countryside Alliance says it expects up to 4,000 supporters to demonstrate against the hunting ban. They have agreed to keep to a demonstration site on the other side of the River Tyne from the conference venue in Gateshead. A bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales has begun in the Court of Appeal. The ban comes into force on 18 February. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance's challenge has succeeded. Richard Dodd, regional director of the Countryside Alliance, said he expected between 2,000 and 4,000 supporters in Tyneside to make their protest, with hunt horns and placards.

Campaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol.

Mr Dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the pro-hunt demonstration outside Parliament in September. ""We are holding a static demonstration, just to remind Labour that we are not going away,"" he said. Northumbria Police said the pedestrian Millennium Bridge, by the demonstration site, will be shut if necessary. But Assistant Chief Constable David Warcup has liaised with several protest groups and said all negotiations had gone well. Fathers 4 Justice, pensioners' rights activists and Stop the War campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the three-day conference which starts on Friday. Pro-hunt campaigners claims the 1949 Parliament Act - which extends the right of the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords - was itself invalid because it was never passed by peers. The High Court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful. Pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in London's High Court on Thursday. The Countryside Alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds. Animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban, many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary.

"Protesters plan airport challenge

Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.

BAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.

Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.

The campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. ""We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. ""Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go."" He added: ""Politicians should not decide where runways should be."" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.

The airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.

"Tories attack burglar 'U-turns'

Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.

The government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: ""It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: ""If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law."" Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. He said: ""We've had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. ""It's not surprising Gordon Brown told him: 'There's nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.'""

Mr Howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke. He said: ""The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making."" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. Tory MP Patrick Mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.

"Leaders meet over Turkish EU bid

Tony Blair has met Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to talk about Turkey entering the EU.

The Downing Street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later in the week. Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU. Italy and Germany also favour an early start to talks, but there is scepticism in France and elsewhere. Some are worried that Turkey's large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the EU difficult.

Some are concerned that a change of government could lead to Turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. And many in France would prefer Turkey to admit that World War I-era killing of Armenians constituted genocide. There are also issues in France and the Netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major Muslim nation into the EU. But Mr Blair and the Labour government have been the staunchest backers of Turkish accession, provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. Mr Blair's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of European Councils. ""The key issue at this week's council will be that of Turkey, but they will also discuss a range of other matters.""

"Choose hope over fear - Kennedy

Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said Charles Kennedy.

In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and ""populist scares"". He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. On the Asian tsunami he said it had been ""very heartening"" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.

The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party ""fades away"" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said. ""A clear division is emerging in British politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. ""Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. While the Conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the European 'menace',"" he said. He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.

It was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. ""But at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,"" he said. His party ""instinctively"" understood the ""new liberal Britain"" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. ""We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. ""Our national institutions are changing too. We are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. In our attitudes and the way we live our lives, this is in many ways a liberal Britain.""

"Profile: David Miliband

David Miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to Cabinet Office minister.

Elected in a safe Labour seat in 2001 his previous job was school standards minister - a role he won in May 2002. Prior to the last election he was a key figure in New Labour as the head of the Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing team. Seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition.

A brief glance at Mr Miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. And while David Miliband is seen as a key Blair lieutenant his brother Ed is a special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretary of the Commission on Social Justice. The 39-year-old was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive before going on to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. He also took an MSc in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

"Borders rail link campaign rally

Campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a Borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened.

They will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure, which ran from Edinburgh through the Borders and on to Carlisle, with a walk at Tweedbank. Anne Borthwick, of Campaign for Borders Rail, said reopening the Waverley Line would restore the area's prosperity. MSPs are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through Midlothian to the Borders. Campaigners have said that reopening the Waverley Line, which could cost up to £100m, would be a huge economic boost for the Borders.

In 2000, Borders Council said the area's economy had suffered since the closure. Ms Borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the Scottish Executive. ""We are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the Waverley Line,"" she said. ""Campaign for Borders Rail is the biggest independent lobby group in Scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the Borders and eventually to Carlisle.

""We believe that it is time for the Scottish Executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future."" Ms Borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the Scottish Borders. A study in 2000, which was commissioned by the executive, Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise, found that a half-hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its operating costs. It also found that a half-hourly service from Gorebridge to Edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the West Coast Main Line at Longtown could also be reinstated.

"'Hitler' row over Welsh arts cash

An artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.

Shani Rhys James is worried that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Welsh Assembly Government. Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be ""crass and ignorant"" to liken a quango review to Hitler's Germany. But Ms James emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.

It was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control. The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella. But Ms James, who won the £30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways. ""Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way.""

But she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.

She told Good Morning Wales: ""Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'. ""As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'. ""Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.'"" She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales.

She added: ""It would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don't think the government has the expertise. ""If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs.

""Wales has moved on. It is international now. It is not set back in How Green Was My Valley?"" Responding to Ms James' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: ""The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. ""Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability."" Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre. She moved to Powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near Llangadfan. She has won a number of arts prizes including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.

"Lords wrong on detainees - Straw

Jack Straw has attacked the decision by Britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.

The foreign secretary said the right to life was the ""most important liberty"" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. Law lords were ""simply wrong"" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.

The House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.

But Mr Straw denied it amounted to a ""constitutional crisis"". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. ""The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an ""embarrassment"" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.

The ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: ""I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.

""In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords."" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.

In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: ""I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to ""madness"", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.

"Profile: David Blunkett

Before he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.

His responsibilities in running the Home Office included civil emergencies, security, terrorism and expenditure. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.

Recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Having received his full backing, Ms Hughes was forced to resign in April over abuses in the visa processing system, which she claimed to be unaware of. Mr Blunkett's own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to ""get back home"" to start rebuilding their countries. And he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a ""sense of belonging"" in Britain, telling them to speak English at home. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and ""airy fairy libertarians"" and earlier in the year coined the phrase ""liberati"", as an amalgam of ""glitterati"" and ""liberal"". Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug .

Before the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as ""a useful way of ensuring that people don't casually think I am available"". He added: ""I am not available because I am just getting on with the job."" Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974. He is one of very few blind MPs, and was the first to reach the front bench and the Cabinet. His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party's National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply ""an inconvenience"". Using Braille for speeches, and briefed by his officials on tape, he also has a sharp tongue at times, and a pragmatic approach to politics.

Mr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. In Tony Blair's first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett's side.

"Strike threat over pension plans

Millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders.

The Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. They believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.

It is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a ""career average"" salary. For each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May. In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon. ""Unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. ""Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. People are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. ""To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65."" On Monday, Tony Blair's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. He said: ""What's important is that there's a process going on, it's out for consultation at the moment, let's wait for that process to complete itself.""

There is already widespread anger over the chancellor's plans to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Now public service unions are united against the plans and the Trades Union Congress is discussing the issue next Monday. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. ""Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,"" he said. ""What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can't afford it for anyone else. ""This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next.""

Mr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. Mark Serwotka, from the Public and Commercial Services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. The Fire Brigades Union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: ""The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.""

"Parties warned over 'grey vote'

Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.

A survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a ""decisive blow"" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.

He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to ""support us all in an ageing society"". ""Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,"" Mr Lishman said. ""Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."" In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. Age Concern says the over-55s are ""united around"" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.

"MPs quiz aides over royal income

Senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the Queen and Prince of Wales are to be questioned by MPs.

Aides from the Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall will appear before the Commons Public Accounts Committee. It has been reported they could be questioned about Prince Charles' spending on Camilla Parker Bowles. But BBC correspondent Peter Hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. Duchy officials, who will appear before the committee on Monday, are only responsible for generating money. The Duchy of Lancaster provides the Queen's private income, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides Prince Charles' annual income. The Duchy of Cornwall is a 140,000-acre estate across 25 counties, and also includes residential properties, shops, offices, stocks and shares. It was set up in 1337 by King Edward III to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. It covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither Charles, nor William and Harry, receive taxpayers' money from the Civil List. However, the Prince of Wales did receive over £4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. The duchy last year generated almost £12m. The prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.

"Tory leader 'cleared' over work

Scottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest.

The Edinburgh MSP earns up to £30,000 a year from the law firm Tods Murray, where he is a partner. Mr McLetchie said he has taken advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. As an MSP, Mr McLetchie signed a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport.

It then emerged Tods Murray has a client which opposes the development. Mr McLetchie then sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell said no complaint had been made against Mr McLetchie, but questions were raised about his dual role. Glenn said MSPs are advised to guard against a conflict of interests and a perception of a conflict.

Mr McLetchie said: ""I'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement I took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded."" He said nothing had changed in respect of his work with the law firm and it was a matter he would have to discuss with the other partners at Tods Murray. ""The firm and I have a very good working relationship and we have done for the last six years,"" said Mr McLetchie. ""I don't suppose I'll be working forever as a lawyer or a politician. I deserve to retire from both, but I'm not willing to put time limits on them.""

"Blair and Blunkett Sheffield trip

Tony Blair is to join Home Secretary David Blunkett in a visit to Sheffield on Thursday.

Mr Blunkett's conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. The Parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give Kimberly Quinn free rail tickets. He is also being investigated over the visa application of Mrs Quinn's ex-nanny. The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair.

On Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a ""giant mess"" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary. The Tory leader went on: ""He doesn't stop there: he thinks the culture secretary's weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn't think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn't developed as expected. ""He says the prime minister doesn't like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully."" Mr Blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.

The home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the £180 back. He has apologised for ""a genuine mistake"" and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. The rail tickets are meant to help MPs' spouses get between Westminster and their constituencies. After his inquiry, Parliamentary watchdog Sir Philip Mawer will report to the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee, the group of MPs who will recommend to the full House of Commons what action - if any - should be taken against Mr Blunkett.

The separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant Sir Alan Budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by Mrs Quinn's nanny, Leoncia Casalme, to stay in the UK. Last week, Mr Blunkett won the first round of a High Court battle with Mrs Quinn for access to her son. Mr Blunkett declined to comment about his own position, saying the inquiry was under way and the High Court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. Downing Street has stressed Mr Blair's support for the home secretary.

"Student 'fee factor' played down

A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.

However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of ""fee refugees"" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.

The figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.

""They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated. ""However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here."" Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.

Also, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: ""Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. ""We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. ""We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. ""Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.""

"Anglers 'could face prosecution'

Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.

Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. The MPs said they were ""concerned"" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.

They called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect ""kept animals"" and ""companion"" animals by setting up a ""duty of care"". In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing ""mutilation"" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest.

The environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. ""We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government's intention to exempt fishing as an activity.""

But the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. ""However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,"" the committee added. The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which ""would be significantly weakened"". MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.

Committee chairman Michael Jack said: ""Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. ""This draft bill is no exception. My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place."" But Mr Jack said the bill ""very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that ""an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law"" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms. ""The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament,"" he added.

"Clarke to press on with ID cards

New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to ""pause for thought"" from Charles Kennedy.

The Lib Dem leader said David Blunkett's resignation was a ""good opportunity"" to question whether the legislation was necessary. But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now. ""ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,"" he said. Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been ""significantly influenced"" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.

The issue would be debated in Parliament next Monday as scheduled he insisted. Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as ""deeply flawed"" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors. ""Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?"" he asked. Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government's plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.

They had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC has warned there is a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.""

The Home Office says people will pay £85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card. The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them. The new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. And there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £1,000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £2,500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. The scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.

"Scots smoking ban details set out

Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.

He told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a ""comprehensive ban"" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were ""lamentable"" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.

The health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby ""tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past"". ""There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,"" he declared. ""Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. ""They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. ""It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking."" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:


 - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland 
 - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers 
 - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 
 - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence 
 - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined 
 - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. 
 

Mr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.

The Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: ""The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. ""There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. ""But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded."" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: ""Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?"" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the ""success stories of New York and Ireland"". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.

"MPs criticise child access system

Divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, MPs have said.

The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said. But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.

Currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. ""An arbitrary 'template' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,"" the MPs said.

They said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. This would ""reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety"", they said. Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed ""a new 'status quo' arrangement for the children to become established by default"", they said.

""Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias, there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. ""Given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases, we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents."" Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five-month inquiry had been a ""complex and emotive"" one. ""At the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation,"" he said. ""This situation has to change. The court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. ""This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.""

"Nuclear strike 'key terror risk'

The UK and US must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic.

Amitai Etzioni, a key influence on New Labour thinking, says the US emphasis on an ""Axis of Evil"" is misplaced. The priority should instead be on ""failing states"", including Russia and Pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues. His report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology.

Professor Etzioni was a senior adviser to President Carter's White House and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of Blairite Third Way politics. In a report for the Foreign Policy Centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.

""Attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack,"" he says. That means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. ""We must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction,"" Prof Etzioni continues.

He suggests so-called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than ""failed and failing states"", which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. He names Russia as the ""failing state"" of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside America. And he is also worried about Pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted leaking nuclear secrets. Prof Etzioni criticises the US for overlooking those reports, suggesting it was done in return for Pakistani help in hunting Osama Bin Laden. ""This is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers,"" he says.


 - Upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure 
 - Creating a new Global Safety Authority to tackle nuclear terrorism, using the intelligence links established in the wake of 11 September - backed by the United Nations' authority 
 - Encouraging, pressuring and using ""all available means"" to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium 
 - When possible, taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted 
 - Compelling ""failing and rogue states"", and eventually all states, to destroy their nuclear bombs.

"Russian ex-spy on hunger strike

An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street.

Viktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an ""average British citizen"". But despite a £65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. Other ex-Russian spies have been given civil service pensions. ""Hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. It can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work,"" Mr Makarov told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""Since I came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.""

Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was ""very happy"" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. Commenting on Mr Makarov's case, he said: ""The British state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week."" But Mr Makarov's case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies. ""I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold,"" Mr Kahn said.

Mr Makarov joined the KGB in 1970s Russia, as an idealistic 20 year-old. One of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was Vladimir Putin. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the West. By the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of Western powers. But he had became deeply disenchanted with the Soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in Poland.

Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service. He spied for MI6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to Perm 35 - a Soviet hard labour camp in the Artic circle. Within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the British authorities he'd been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an MI6 agent in Latvia. He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen. But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for £65,000 to buy a small house. But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. Government sources told the BBC they had reached a final settlement with the former spy, which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.

"Lib Dems 'to target stamp duty'

The Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers.

Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to £150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax. He said first-time buyers were being ""squeezed out"" of the housing market. The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.

Under the proposals, the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1,000, according to Mr Cable. ""First time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net,"" he said. ""By failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold Gordon Brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest. ""By pledging to increase the threshold to £150,000, the Liberal Democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax."" Paul Boateng MP, Labour's Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ""The Lib Dems' sums don't add up. ""They can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments."" Mr Cable will publish his ""Alternative Budget"" on Monday.

"Kelly trails new discipline power

Teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a ""zero tolerance"" drive, Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has suggested.

Ms Kelly told the BBC progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. The minister also confirmed she received ""spiritual support"" from the Catholic movement Opus Dei. But she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.

The Conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. Ms Kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. She told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: ""It is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. ""We have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.

""But quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled. ""I would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision."" It is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. Head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. Her links to Opus Dei, which means ""Work of God"" in Latin, have provoked controversy.

Critics say the organisation, which adheres strictly to Catholic teachings, is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. Asked if she was a member of the group, Ms Kelly said: ""I do have spiritual support from Opus Dei and that is right. ""But those are private spiritual matters and I'm sure you'll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life."" She categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. Her collective responsibility as a Cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas, she argued.

The government has yet to issue its official response to the Tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. Ms Kelly said reforms should build on GCSEs and A-levels. Her comments did not impress Tory shadow education secretary Tim Collins. ""Ruth Kelly wants to ditch the Tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place,"" he said. ""She also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. This is an all talk agenda that lets down children, teachers and parents.""

"Citizenship event for 18s touted

Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.

The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches ""inclusive citizenship"" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britain's young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their ""other cultural identities"" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.

The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bell's comments were ""highly irresponsible"". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called 'Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society'. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. ""It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged."" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.

""It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,"" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: ""But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. ""This strategy sets out the government's commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society."" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.

The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.

"EU China arms ban 'to be lifted'

The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.

The 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.

In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU's move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a ""product of the Cold War"". German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. ""I have long understood China's argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don't think it is,"" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said ""it is more likely than not"" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. ""If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.""

Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of ""the motives of some other countries within the EU"" in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washington's objections were based on a ""lack of information and understanding"" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And ""intense discussions"" were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.

"'Debate needed' on donations cap

A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.

Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.

There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.

Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.

The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.

"Cardinal criticises Iraq war cost

Billions of pounds spent on conflict in Iraq and in the Middle East should have been used to reduce poverty, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor has said.

The head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales made the comments on BBC Radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his Christmas Midnight Mass. The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty"". He added: ""If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears."" The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is ""worth, always, striving for"".

""How is it that peace has not arrived?,"" the cardinal will ask. ""How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?"" ""How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace?"" Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system.

On Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. ""It is possible, it is real, it is worth, always, striving for, because of the promise of Our Saviour,"" he will say. ""I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. "" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make. But Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he will put Africa at the top of the agenda when Britain chairs the G8 summit next year.

"Assembly ballot papers 'missing'

Hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the North East have ""disappeared"".

Royal Mail says it is investigating the situation, which has meant about 300 homes in County Durham are not receiving voting packs. Officials at Darlington Council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation. The all-postal votes of about two million electors are due to be handed in by 4 November. A spokesman for Darlington Council said: ""We have sent out the ballot papers, the problem is with Royal Mail. ""Somewhere along the line, something has gone wrong and these ballot papers have not been delivered. ""The Royal Mail is investigating to see if they can find out what the problem is.""

A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: ""We are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the Mowden area of Darlington. ""This is affecting several hundred properties, which have failed to receive ballot papers. ""We are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem. ""No-one will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary. ""We are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote.""

The Darlington Council spokesman added: ""Initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in Mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now. ""We then made further investigations and it became clear this was a bigger issue."" A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission told BBC News Online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected. She said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time. So far a total of 569,072 ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the North East.

"Muslims discuss election concerns

Issues that Muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by UK community representatives.

The event is being held by the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), which believes Muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections. But a spokesman stressed the meeting was ""not necessarily anti-Labour"". ""This meeting is not anti-party in particular, it's anti-policy, it's on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on,"" MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesday's event.

""There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues."" Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.

Approximately 1.1m of the UK's 1.6m Muslims are of voting age. Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters.

Anger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason, with many saying it was ""unjustified"". Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday's event. Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The chairman of the MCB's public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a ""significant factor"" affecting Muslims' voting intentions. ""I think it's going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,"" Mr Khan said.

However, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make. ""For the most part the Labour constituencies where there's a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,"" Professor Curtice said.

The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001. In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour's Lorna Fitzsimons. But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. ""Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,"" he said. But Dr Tamimi said MAB's intention was not to ""empower"" the Tories. ""We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly. ""If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,"" Dr Tamimi said.

"Drive to 'save' festive holidays

Efforts are being made to 'protect' workers' days off on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

Support is being sought for a bill which would ensure that large retailers in Scotland remain closed on Christmas Day and 1 January. The Usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families. MSP Karen Whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season. In recent years, more stores have been opening on traditional holidays, with some starting their end-of-year sale on Christmas Day or New Year's Day. Ms Whitefield said: ""I have found members of the public to be very supportive when I have been campaigning on the streets.

""The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family."" Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: ""Christmas Day and New Year's Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special. They are largely collective days of rest. ""We want people to tell Karen, through her consultation, whether they want the special nature of these days to remain, or whether they want them to become like any other trading day, with shops open for business as usual."" The consultation on a Christmas & New Year's Day Trading Bill has so far attracted almost 500 responses and closes on 7 February.

"Blair hails Turkey-EU talks deal

Tony Blair has hailed a deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership as important for the world's future ""peace and prosperity"".

Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. Leaving a Brussels summit Mr Blair said ""the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred"". The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus. It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership.

If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. Mr Blair said having Turkey in the EU was of ""importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country, Britain, and the wider world"".

""We are stating a fundamental principle that the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred from Europe. ""On the contrary, if it fulfils the same principles of human rights, then Muslim and Christian can work together."" Under the agreement, Turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the Greek Cypriot government, but gives Turkey more time to sell the idea to its people.

The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a ""red line"". It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed. The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005. However, talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

"Guantanamo pair's passport ban

The government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.

A letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the US. This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said. An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men's solicitor says.

It is not known whether the other two men released from the Cuba detention camp in January - Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg - have also received letters. The government is implementing the rarely used Royal Prerogative in order to withdraw the men's passports. It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. The letter, from the Home Office, says: ""I am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the United States, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the United Kingdom, you would take part in activities against the United Kingdom, or allied targets.""

The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases.

The Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.

Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. He added: ""The power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and I find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time."" He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative. The Liberal Democrats have promised to raise the issue in Parliament.

Amnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on ""torture evidence"" obtained at Guantanamo Bay. ""Furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the UK in the detention of UK residents and nationals and possibly many others at Guantanamo Bay,"" said director Kate Allen. The men's solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy ""condemns and prohibits"" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused. Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.

"Commons hunt protest charges

Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.

The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said.

Five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. The men's solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.

""There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence,"" he said. ""If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively. ""We are not prosecuted for that. We are prosecuted for a Public Order Act offence. We are not guilty of it."" They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said. Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: ""I have no regrets. ""We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country."" One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.

The other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York, and former royal chef Nick Wood, 41. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. Four of the men ran out from behind the speaker's chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. Three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.

Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was ""impossibly difficult to determine"" and open to different interpretations.

"Child access laws shake-up

Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC ""there is a recognition that something is wrong"". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.

Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:


 - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past 
 - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases 
 - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet 
 - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. 
 

Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a ""nuclear option"" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.

Failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published ""in the next two weeks,"" a spokesman said.

The government's proposals have met with disapproval from fathers' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals ""lacked compulsion"".

""We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. ""Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart."" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.

The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were ""inadequate"" and were ""papering over the cracks of the current system"". She said a Conservative government would bring a ""radical reform"" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a ""legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation"". ""We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,"" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up ""like property"" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having ""rigid targets"".

"MPs to debate 'euthanasia laws'

MPs are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia ""by the back door"".

The bill would give legal force to ""living wills"", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. The Mental Capacity Bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. But Christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate.

Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.

The bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors. Critics fear it could allow ""killing by omission"" through withdrawing treatment. An amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. Ninety one MPs have signed a petition backing the amendment. MPs could vote on it later on Tuesday, during the bill's report stage debate. The Bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the Lords, before becoming law.

The Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and Lawyers' Christian Fellowship (LCF) said the Mental Capacity Bill would allow euthanasia by the ""back door"". Peter Saunders of the CMF said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory, not legally binding. ""CMF is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take,"" he said.

The LCF's Andrea Williams said there were ""too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors"". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field told BBC Two's Newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to ""do away"" with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.

Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy said laws affecting 750,000 people with dementia needed updating. Mr Lammy told BBC News Labour MPs would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened, not changed. ""We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,"" he said. ""Doctors are saying they want more clarity. Patients are saying they want more clarity."" The Making Decisions Alliance, which includes the Alzheimer's Society, Age Concern, Mencap and the National Autistic Society, said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. ""It will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity,"" the alliance said in a statement. The British Medical Association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. Debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the UK because of cases like that of motor neurone patient Diane Pretty. She died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.

"Talks aim to avert pension strike

Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.

Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.

The five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.""

Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

"Opposition grows to house arrests

The Conservatives have expressed ""serious misgivings"" about government plans for keeping UK and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.

Michael Howard said he would not back the Home Secretary's plans for ""control orders"" which include home detention. ""I do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician,"" he said. The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.

The government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. New Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has backed the control orders, saying: ""I'm sorry. It is a dilemma, but there is only one choice."" But Mr Howard said: ""We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life.""

He argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. Mr Howard said he feared ""internment without trial creates martyrs"" and could be ""a very effective recruiting sergeant"" for terrorists"". His party plans to move an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. He called on the prime minister to ""enter into constructive discussions"" with his party to find a ""better way forward"". Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect. On Monday, the legal team for two Algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. Most of the terror suspects are detained at Belmarsh Prison in London. The Liberal Democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's a matter of principle for us that we can't have a situation where the Home Secretary is able to impose house detention now on UK nationals as well as foreign nationals.""

The Lib Dems believe the Home Secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. ""We think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the Home Secretary's say so. That must be done with a proper judicial process, a judge involved in making those decisions,"" said Mr Oaten. Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. He said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in ""serious"" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.

"Visa decision 'every 11 minutes'

Visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes, MPs have said.

Pressure was placed on staff to be efficient, rather than to do a thorough examination of an application, the Public Accounts Committee found. Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market. Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: ""There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. ""Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. ""

The committee's report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year. Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian ""entrepreneurs"". Mr Leigh said the Home Office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. A Home Office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. He added ""that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post, which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system"".

"'No more concessions' on terror

Charles Clarke says he has ""no desire"" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.

MPs voted in favour of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill after Mr Clarke agreed to key changes - but Labour's majority was reduced to 14. The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords, said ministers should expect it to be ""substantially re-written"".

The Bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. They would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against.

On Monday, MPs voted 272-219 in favour of the Bill after key concessions from Mr Clarke. The government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the Commons despite the support of 62 Labour rebels. Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. Lord Strathclyde warned ministers that they should ""prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the Bill"". ""They should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and I think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest.""

But Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the changes he had made to the Bill to win over critics in the Commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the Lords. ""No Bill goes through Parliament without detailed consideration being made, but I believe that what I announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the House of Lords,"" he said.

""I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the Bill."" Mr Clarke's proposed amendment will be debated by the Lords on Tuesday without having been considered by MPs. The debate is unlikely to result in a vote. Speaking after the Commons debate, shadow home secretary David Davies said the bill had been ""clearly very badly drawn-up"" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. He said it would be possible to ""rescue"" the government and make the law ""tolerable"" by amending it in the Lords. ""The scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous,"" he told BBC News.

Mark Oaten, for the Liberal Democrats, said Monday night's vote showed the government had ""lost the confidence of all sides of the House"". He said: ""They need to rethink the bill, and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders, build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. ""Unless there is a major movement, this bill is doomed to fail.""

BBC News political editor Andrew Marr said: ""I think that this is a bill in deep trouble. It's been unravelling in the House of Commons - it may unravel further."" The government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 March, when the current powers expire.

"No to Royal succession shake-up

A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.

The legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.

The Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that ""for all practical purposes its effects are limited"".

The changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a ""complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues"", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. ""It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,"" he added.

He did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. ""We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,"" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: ""The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. ""What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. ""We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics."" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a ""secular"" state would be markedly ""less tolerant"", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.

"BNP leader Nick Griffin arrested

The leader of the British National Party has been arrested as part of a police inquiry following the screening of a BBC documentary.

A party spokesman said Nick Griffin was arrested on Tuesday morning on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred. West Yorkshire police confirmed they had arrested a 45-year-old man from outside their area. BNP founding chairman John Tyndall was arrested on Sunday on the same charge.

In July, the BBC documentary Secret Agent featured covertly-filmed footage of BNP activists. Mr Griffin is the twelfth man to be arrested following the documentary. Nine men from West Yorkshire and another man from Leicester have been arrested and freed on bail. Seven of the men had been held variously in connection with suspected racially aggravated public order offences, conspiracy to commit criminal damage and possession of a firearm. Two men, both from Keighley, were arrested in September on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. A 24-year-old man from Leicester was detained on Monday on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred. A BNP spokesperson said Mr Tyndall, from Brighton, was arrested following a speech he made in Burnley, Lancashire, and was released on police bail.

"Boris opposes mayor apology

Ken Livingstone should ""stick to his guns"" and not apologise for his ""Nazi"" comment to a Jewish reporter, Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted.

Mr Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was ""an attempt to reassure Jewish voters"". London mayor Mr Livingstone says he is ""standing by"" his remarks which likened an Evening Standard journalist to a ""concentration camp guard"". But the prime minister says it is time for Mr Livingstone to say sorry.

Labour's Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked. Later the prime minister said: ""A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise.""

However, Mr Johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair ""should butt out of"" the row. ""I don't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this,"" The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's a dispute between Ken Livingstone and a reporter on the Evening Standard."" Mr Johnson, MP for Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said he suspected Labour was now trying to reassure Jewish voters ""because of this curious way in which Labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned Muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war"".

""Ken doesn't think he's got anything to say sorry for and if that's really his feeling, then I think that he should stick to his guns,"" he said. Mr Johnson apologised last October for perpetuating an ""outdated stereotype"" of Liverpool in the leader article on the death of Mr Bigley. The article in the magazine suggested grieving Liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. It also attributed blame to drunken Liverpool football fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. Mr Johnson told Today: ""It's perfectly true that I got into the grovelling game myself and when I apologised there were some things that I felt I ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things I didn't think I should apologise for,"" he said. ""But here's old Ken - he's been crass, he's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but I don't think actually if you read what he said, although it was extraordinary and rude, I don't think he was actually anti-Semitic.""

"Report attacks defence spending

The Ministry of Defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects.

A National Audit Office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by £1.7bn in the past year. It says there is ""little evidence"" the MoD's performance had improved, despite the introduction of a ""smart acquisition"" policy six years ago. A senior defence official told the BBC lessons were being learned. The NAO's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. The total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months.

Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. ""Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,"" the report says. The NAO found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older ""legacy projects"", such as the Eurofighter. A senior defence official, speaking to the BBC's defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. This year's overspend was significantly less than last year's £3.1bn total, and the Defence Procurement Agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.

Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was ""obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown"", but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had ""undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects"". The latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises. Turning around the Defence Procurement Agency ""was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed"", he said. Our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. But he added some projects, such as the C-17 heavy lift aircraft and Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF), were showing good performances.

"Brown names 16 March for Budget

Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.

The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. It is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 May.

Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's eighth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue. The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. ""In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,"" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.

"Asylum children to face returns

The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.

The trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities.

The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.

Since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.

Under the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the ""best interest"" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.

""If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. 'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing ""the difficult issue"" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children ""and leave them to rot"". ""We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,"" said the spokesman. ""We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.

""We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities."" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. ""From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,"" said Mr Hogg. ""In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. ""The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries."" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.

"'Fido' to be taken off vote lists

The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.

Those are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.

The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual ""identifiers"" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.

Mr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at ""hard to reach"" voters, for example. Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.

He argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.

"'More to do' on adult literacy

The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.

The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. But a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed ""creative"" ideas. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.

According to the report, ""more than half"" the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. These are defined as ""adults"" by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The number of these people gaining qualifications was ""rising slowly"". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: ""Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. ""More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives."" In 2001, the government launched the Get On scheme - aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. Sir John said ""substantial progress"" had been made since, adding that this was ""only the beginning"". The government and its partners would ""need to be creative and responsive"". Some £3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their ""enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge"" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more ""personalised learning"" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers.

It should also assess adult learners' progress ""at frequent intervals"", the report adds. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was ""only the start of the journey"". An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. This is thought to cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government's scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Get On's participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: ""We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace."" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: ""This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. ""Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk."" Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: ""Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.""

"Tory backing for ID cards

The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards.

The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID. The decision follows a ""tough meeting"" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC. The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.

They have said the scheme is ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. The party has been ""agnostic"" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said. Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. ""It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.""

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards. ""The Tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it."" The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.""

"Labour's 'EU propaganda'

A ""taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise"" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.

Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of ""running scared"" of debate. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.

Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005. Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"". Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was ""fully justified"". ""We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said.

Mr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. ""Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,"" he asked. The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand. ""The government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the British people,"" he said. ""Who are they trying to kid?"" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: ""Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?"" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a ""no"" vote.

Mr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a ""level playing field"" on immigration and asylum controls. ""You are setting your face against all of these things,"" he added. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the UK, to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.

"Hague 'given up' his PM ambition

Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.

Mr Hague, 43, told the Daily Telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too ""boring"" and unfulfilling. Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench. He also told the paper he hopes to remain MP for Richmond, North Yorks, and start a family with wife Ffion. Mr Hague, who recently had published the biography of William Pitt the Younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.

He told the newspaper: ""I don't know whether I will ever go back on to the front, but don't rush me."" Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, Mr Hague replied: ""No. Definitely not."" His determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior Conservative members, who say the party needs him. Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a ""huge boost"" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench. Mr Hague became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36. He said: ""I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. ""I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling."" Mr Hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. ""Maybe I wasn't as driven by politics as I thought I was,"" he said.

"Job cuts 'false economy'  - TUC

Plans to shed 71,000 civil service jobs will prove to be a ""false economy"" that could hamper public sector reforms, according to a TUC report.

Public and Commercial Services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 November. The TUC said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the £22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. General secretary Brendan Barber warned the ""costs could easily outweigh the benefits"". ""The government's big boost to public spending is now showing results,"" said Mr Barber. ""Public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.

""They may shoot a Tory fox, but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. The costs could easily outweigh the benefits."" Next Friday's strike action by the PCS is the biggest in the civil service since 1993, hitting Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices, customs and driving tests. The union says it is concerned about pensions, sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. Last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and Jobcentres across the UK would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. The number of civil servants in Britain rose to more than 520,000 in April. Other areas the strike will affect include passports, museums and galleries, libraries and health and safety inspections.

"UK's 'useless' quangos under fire

The UK has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other's efforts, a report claims.

Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 author Dan Lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since Labour won power in 1997. He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the report and called for a ""slimming down"".

Conservative deregulation spokesman John Redwood said: ""The research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos, and slimming down the rest.

""A Conservative government will axe 162 quangos, as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government."" Lib Dem spokesman Ed Davey meanwhile said instead of the ""bonfire of quangos"" New Labour had promised, there had been an ""explosion"" of them. ""For over two decades, under both Tory and Labour governments, these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. ""Liberal Democrats would abolish many, merge others, and make any that remain properly accountable."" Labour representatives were unavailable for comment. The quango guide follows last year's government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.

Mr Lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £1.8bn a year - cash he says which ""appears to be almost entirely wasted"". As well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. He also listed what he dubbed the nine ""most useless quangos"". They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council. Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, ""surprising"". He said the £80m spent annually on the Energy Savings Trust, which promotes renewable energy, would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for British homes.

And he argued it was ""absurd"" to charge farmers for Agricultural Wages Committees, which set working and wage standards in the industry, when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour. ""If a football team can afford to pay £27m for Wayne Rooney, why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the Football Licensing Authority to the tune of over £1.1m a year?"" Mr Lewis asked. The report is published by the Efficiency in Government Unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the Economic Research Council and the Centre for Policy Studies. It says before a new public body is set up, an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.

"Howard backs stem cell research

Michael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.

The controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it. But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neurone disease. ""I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,"" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.

Mr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: ""We mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. ""Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. ""With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. ""I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. ""I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.""

Mr Howard acknowledged there were ""no easy answers"" over such an issue but it was necessary to ""have the courage to do what we know to be morally right"". He added: ""Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved."" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. Mr Howard made his remarks during a speech in Westminster to the Conservative National Women's Committee on ambitions and values.

"Howard unveils Tory asylum plans

Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.

As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. Some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.

Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. ""By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.

In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: ""It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."" He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that ""firm but fair"" immigration controls were essential for good community relations.


 - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers 
 - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents 
 - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for ""national security"" 
 - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps. Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. 
 

The Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.

Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. The plans would help achieve a ""substantial reduction"" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current ""unfair and inhumane"" system.

""We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum,"" Mr Howard said. ""By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.""

But the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans ""dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible"". Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.

He did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. Mr Howard called that suggestion ""disgraceful"".

"Campaign 'cold calls' questioned

Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing ""cold calls"".

The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. The information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a ""grey"" area if personal data is kept. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.

But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.

The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for ""voter identification"" calls. ""When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,"" he said. ""So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.""

He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: ""We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law."" A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. ""If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,"" he said.

The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. The spokesman said there was ""no yes or no"" answer and the area was ""pretty grey"". He added: ""If someone complained, then we would investigate that. Political parties are aware of the regulations. At the last by-elections, we reminded them."" Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: ""The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are ""significant"" numbers of such calls. ""I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,"" he tells the commissioner. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.

"Tory leader quits legal position

David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role.

The Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports. But on Friday he said: ""I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect."" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had ""cleverly"" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman ""totally refuted"" any wrongdoing.

Mr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.

Explaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: ""I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. ""However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. ""To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. ""I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.""

Labour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was ""very clever"" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. ""He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,"" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings ""where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner"". However, MSPs' Code of Conduct ""recognises a wider definition"" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.

But a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie's decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: ""This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. ""However it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.""

Scottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I'm sure he will be reflecting on it."" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not ""lose any sleep over it"". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year. He added: ""David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.""

"MSPs hear renewed climate warning

Climate change could be completely out of control within several decades, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is warning a committee of MSPs.

Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee. Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. Solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal UK air travel and boosting electric trains. The evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland. Sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases, as pollution from transport emissions increases.

Ecologists are warning MSPs that Scotland may have to accept ""significant intrusion"" from wind farms. It is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. Sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. Experts studying the seas off Scotland's west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month.

They predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands and Southampton have been looking at wave heights in the Atlantic over the last nine years. The project was conducted jointly by the Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute network, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre. Scientists carried out a series of studies, including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the Hebrides.

"Vouchers 'to cut winter deaths'

Pensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats, as snow and cold temperatures continue.

The party says the plans could save the average pensioner £100 every year and cut winter deaths. The government gives £200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or £300 where people are over 80. The Tories promise to keep the payments. The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: ""The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year."" The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save £100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more ""intelligently"" than at present.

"New 'yob' targets to be unveiled

Fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in England and Wales will be named on Thursday.

Ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.

Police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.

Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.

He is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. ""We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,"" he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.

Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that ""about a third"" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.

"Kennedy calls for Iraq exit plans

Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.

In a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a ""crucible of militant terrorism"". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops ""as soon as the situation allows"", he said in London. Any exit strategy must ""augment and support"" the democratic process.

""There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,"" he said. ""There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces."" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal ""regardless of the situation on the ground"".

He accused Mr Blair's government of ""being less than straightforward"" over its plans. ""Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,"" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. ""He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows."" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - ""especially Islamic countries"".

"McConnell in 'drunk' remark row

Scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk ""once in a while"".

Jack McConnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were ""a recognition that people will get drunk"". The first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell. Margaret Davidson, the independent member for the Loch Ness West, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.

When one pupil asked Mr McConnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: ""I'm sure there's no under-age drinking in the Highlands."" He went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. He said: ""I hope I'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them."" Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. ""The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,"" he said. ""Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. ""We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.""

He added: ""By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly."" SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell. ""We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. ""The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately."" But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind. ""He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s,"" she said. ""It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.""

"Brown hits back in Blair rift row

Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government.

Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of ""competing agendas"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. He said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members' jobs. It suited the purpose of Mr Baume's union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Under the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. Mr Brown said: ""To be honest I don't think you can rely on his [Mr Baume's] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. ""Mr Blair and I are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. We are determined to go on with the Gershon reforms."" He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge. On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes ""conflicting and competing agendas for government"" between Number 10 and the Treasury.

What the chancellor wanted was ""not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see"", Mr Baume said. ""Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the Treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. ""He also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. ""The problem is that on many occasions these two don't add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle."" Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a ""soap opera"" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""The battle Royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and Tony Blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.""

"Tories 'would cut number of MPs'

The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.

The plan forms part of the party's ""smaller government bill"", to be unveiled later this week. Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide whether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.

The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.

The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. ""It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?"" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: ""This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the State"".

Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the ""great unfairness"" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was ""consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom"" if the assembly was scrapped. Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. ""You have got to have a big bang. We don't want this like the House of Lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.""

"UK plan to deport terror suspects

Deals are being sought to allow the UK to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke told the Times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful. The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.

Mr Clarke told The Times: ""I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come."" He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw ""in a very positive way"". Mr Clarke said that he was seeking ""memorandums of understanding"" between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: ""I do not think the solution to the Law Lords' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. ""There are other strands that we have to do."" But the Liberal Democrat's shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.

""The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,"" he told BBC News. ""And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,"" Mr Oaten said. ""Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country."" ""Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.""

The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult. ""Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it's not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it won't be the solution."" Daniel Sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. ""The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,"" he said.

"Ministers deny care sums 'wrong'

Ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.

A report by the Fraser of Allander Institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. Deputy Health Minister Rhona Brankin has pledged to study the research. SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.

The rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the ""care development group"" of Scottish Executive experts who prepared the original costings, according to findings published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary of Strathclyde University's Fraser of Allander Institute. ""Dubious"" assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022, the report warned.

It was carried out by husband and wife economist team Jim and Margaret Cuthbert. But Ms Brankin told BBC Radio Scotland: ""We don't think we got our sums wrong. ""Obviously we will examine the findings of this new report, along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned. ""We will look in great detail at any contribution to this, because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future. ""And we are absolutely committed to doing that.""

But the Scottish National Party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. Ms Sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive's support for the policy, there were questions which needed to be answered and, if necessary, sums redone. She said: ""Serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the Scottish Executive. ""We need to know that the money is there, not just for this year or next year, but into the future so that older people, and those who are looking forward to older age, can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.""

"Blair stresses prosperity goals

Tony Blair says his party's next manifesto will be ""unremittingly New Labour"" and aimed at producing ""personal prosperity for all"".

The prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with Gordon Brown with the speech in Chatham, Kent. He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring ""radically improved"" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.

With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. Now Mr Blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of Labour's platform for a third term in government. Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.

And on Thursday Mr Blair is saying: ""I want to talk about the central purpose ofNew Labour - which is to increase personal prosperity and well-being, not justfor a few but for all. ""By prosperity I mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies, and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state.""

The Tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. On Wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and Mr Brown under the words ""How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?"" Michael Howard and frontbencher John Redwood on Thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. They say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make Britain more competitive.

The Liberal Democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. The latest speculation about relations between New Labour's two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book, Brown's Britain by Robert Preston. In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe."" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: ""Of course I trust the prime minister.""

"Guantanamo man 'suing government'

A British terror suspect held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.

Martin Mubanga claimed in the Observer that an MI6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the US camp in Cuba, following his arrest in Zambia. Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not ""well informed"". Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.

He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002. Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam. But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead. Mr Mubanga said the ""MI6 agent"" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission. Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.

His lawyer Louise Christian said: ""'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo."" And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga's transfer to Guantanamo. But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies. And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: ""I'm not organising a specific investigation into it."" Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.

He claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: ""I've lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim. He added: ""The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. They've made me what I am - even if I'm not quite sure yet who that person is."" The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. In a statement, it said: ""The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. ""He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror."" But Fair Trials Abroad director Stephen Jakobi said there were similarities between Mr Mubanga's account and those of other Guantanamo detainees. He said: ""The pattern is the same. The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo. ""Is [Charles Clarke] really pretending this is all made up?"" Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.

"Council tax rise 'reasonable'

Welsh councils should set their taxes at ""reasonable levels"" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.

Finance Minister Sue Essex said it was a ""good deal"" for local government. The £3.2bn settlement includes the ""full"" £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was ""confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels."" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that ""significant"" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. ""A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,"" said Mr Wellington. ""It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: ""I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. ""I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties."" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, ""even for those people who have moved up a band"".

The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: ""This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level."" Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement ""hugely disappointing"". He said: ""Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger."" ""This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both."" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: ""I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty."" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change ""is taking spin to the very verge of deception"". He added: ""Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.""

"Blunkett row should end - Blair

Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.

The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny. Sir Alan Budd found a ""chain of events"" linked Mr Blunkett to Leoncia Casalme's indefinite leave to remain application. At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.

On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. In his first comments since Sir Alan's announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail. But told BBC News: ""As far as I'm concerned, we have drawn a line under that.""

Asked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: ""I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains. ""He's been a tremendous colleague, he's done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. The future is something we will have to approach in the future."" The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a ""grubby government"". He said Mr Blunkett's integrity remained intact: ""He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said. ""But I think Sir Alan Budd also accepted there wasn't some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on.""

Earlier, Mr Howard said: ""There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. There were so many questions that weren't answered."" There was ""deceit at the heart of government"" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was ""a strong case for a judge-led judicial review"".

He said: ""Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that."" Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan's findings. In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry's findings. He said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.

"Minimum rate for foster parents

Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced.

Payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just £50 a week for clothes, food and other costs. Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible. However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.

Ms Hodge said: ""Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. ""We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. ""Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity."" The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.

Fostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. ""There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. ""And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets."" The charity recommends a weekly payment of £108.49 for looking after a baby. In a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as £100 per week.

The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the government's plans. Tony Hunter, the organisation's president, said: ""There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Government's proposals. ""But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.""

"Royal couple watch nation's mood

Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.

Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple's decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.

The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: ""I'm just coming down to earth."" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were ""absolutely delighted"". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.

The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them ""very happy"". Princes William and Harry said they are ""very happy"" and wish the couple ""all the luck in the future"". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.

The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. ""His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],"" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: ""I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step."" Tony Blair said he was ""delighted"" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia's Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a ""sensible and a good thing"". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince's Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.

"Muslim police stops 'more likely'

UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Office minister has said.

Hazel Blears said innocent Muslims would be targeted because of the search for Islamic extremists. Qualifications for religious leaders to enter the UK could also be made tougher, she told a Commons inquiry. Her comments have been described as ""irresponsible"" and ""outrageous"" by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC).

""The threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam, or who are falsely hiding behind Islam,"" the Salford MP told the Commons home affairs committee.

""It means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community."" It was a reality that should be recognised, she said. ""If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area,"" she added. On ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded. Last year, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak English to a certain level.

IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of ""playing an Islamophobia card"" in the run-up to a general election.

""She is demonising and alienating our community,"" he said. ""It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. ""This sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists."" Later, the prime minister's official spokesman urged people to put Ms Blears' comments into context. The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.

""What is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. ""It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,"" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.

Figures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. Separate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population. Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.

"Howard attacks cost of asylum

Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's ""chaotic"" asylum system under Tony Blair.

The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997. Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers.

Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's ""genuine refugees"".

""The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution,"" he was due to say. ""But if we are to fulfil responsibility, we have to get a grip of the system. ""Fair play matters. People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,"" he said. ""And let's be clear. Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity."" Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.

That prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. ""If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,"" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. ""If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard's policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. ""When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities. ""We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.""

Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. ""By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. On Monday, Mr Howard said: ""It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.""

"Brown outlines third term vision

Gordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labour's next general election bid.

He said ensuring every child in Britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the NHS's creation. The chancellor has previously planned the party's election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn - a key ally of Tony Blair. The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.

Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. ""As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities."" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was ""a warning shot"" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. ""It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,"" was Mr Marr's assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be ""central"". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was ""in part"" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy. And he pledged childcare would be a ""centrepiece"" of Labour's manifesto. He also predicted the next general election will be a ""tough, tough fight"" for New Labour. But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May. Mr Blair said he was taking ""nothing for granted"" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

"'Super union' merger plan touted

Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a ""super union"" of two million members.

The move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that ""nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda"" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.

"UK firms 'embracing e-commerce'

UK firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before, e-commerce minister Mike O'Brien says.

A government-commissioned study ranked the UK third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ICT). The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. Mr O'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead. The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.

It showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O'Brien said: ""The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. ""It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years."" The government would play its part in ""cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish"", Mr O'Brien said. The ""clear message"" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.

""However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,"" he added. The International Benchmarking Study was based on 8,000 telephone interviews with businesses, of which more than 2,700 were UK businesses. It is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ICT in the world's most industrialised nations.

"UK heading wrong way - Howard

Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said.

""Britain is heading in the wrong direction"", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message. Mr Blair's government was a ""bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,"" he added. But Labour's campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: ""Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again"". Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.

""We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. ""Yet Britain's response has shone a light on our nation's character. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever."" He went on to reflect on the values that ""most Britons hold dear"". Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to ""turn these beliefs into reality"" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. ""How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? ""Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?""

Mr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the ""wrong solution"" to them.

""The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. ""Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today."" The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. ""We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. ""We simply need to change direction. The election will give Britain the chance to change."" This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.

But Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: ""It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January."" ""Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. ""With Labour Britain is working. Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.

"Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party

Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk has said he wants to ""change the face of British politics"" as he launched his new party.

Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party,said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for ""truth"" - would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he was glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.

Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. And he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. On Thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.

Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week. It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had ""gone AWOL"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. ""While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,"" he said. ""I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. ""And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.""

Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. ""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

This is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.

Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!

It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.

UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.

If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.

So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!

Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!

Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!

Well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here

Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.

Veritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?

"Blair 'damaged' by Blunkett row

A majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over David Blunkett's involvement in a visa application, a poll suggests.

But nearly half those surveyed said Mr Blunkett should return to Cabinet if Labour won the next election. Some 63% of respondents in the Sunday Times poll thought his former lover - Kimberly Quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign. YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December. Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinn's former nanny had been speeded up. Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong. Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election. One in four said he should be back in the Government's top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.

Three-quarters said Mr Blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see Mrs Quinn's son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for Mrs Quinn. A total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for Mr Blunkett, with 40% saying they did not. Forty-three per cent thought Mr Blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed. Meantime, 32% said Mr Blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed. A majority, 52%, said Chancellor Gordon Brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.

A second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy. Labour lead the Conservatives by 39% to 34% with the Liberal Democrats on 19%. CommunicateResearch interviewed 401 people before David Blunkett's resignation and 601 afterwards. Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. Thirty per cent said the affair showed Mr Blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%, disagreed.

"MP's shock at long lost daughter

Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was ""out of control"" during the ""wild"" 1960s.

Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as ""Precious"" at school. Despite being told he was a ""nutter who died at sea"" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.

Mr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: ""I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead."" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a ""set-up"" but he then realised all the dates fitted. ""It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,"" said the Ealing North MP. ""I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.""

Mr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: ""The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. ""We were finishing each other sentences."" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.

"Green fear for transport ballot

The Green Party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in Edinburgh's transport referendum.

Edinburgh City Council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital. But Green MSP Mark Ballard fears people not on the council's edited electoral register may miss out. Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters, such as the transport referendum. Therefore, residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote.

However, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of February's voting deadline. Mr Ballard said: ""This vote will set the future of transport in Edinburgh for decades to come. ""It is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in Edinburgh City and the surrounding areas, are registered to vote in the ballot. ""Many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say. ""Everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible, and that means encouraging people to take part."" The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. The outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. Towards the end of February, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to Scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.

"New drink limit 'would cut toll'

More lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.

University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government's Road Safety Bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year.

A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. Professor Allsop said: ""Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver's BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit. ""Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.""

Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. They believe educating drivers is more important. The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink-driving. Road safety head Andrew Howard said: ""It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.

""Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone."" Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink-driving remained a ""major killer"", with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. The Road Safety Bill, which gets its second reading on Tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. In an article for the Times newspaper, Ms Dunwoody, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, says: ""Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. ""It is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph, they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. If you are going at 40mph, nine times out of ten they will die.""

"CSA 'could close', says minister

Ministers would not rule out scrapping the Child Support Agency if it failed to improve, Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson has warned.

But he said replacing the controversial CSA would be ""the nuclear option"". A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: ""If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.""

The committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was ""fit for purpose"", describing it as ""a failing organisation"" and ""in crisis"" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the ""abandonment option"", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.

And responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. ""But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work.""

The MPs launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up. The MPs found the £456m system from American IT giant EDS was ""nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate"". Faced with the committee's criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency's staff by 25%. The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.

It is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m, while a further £947m has been designated as ""unrecoverable"".

Michelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the £57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an ""on-going battle"" with the CSA. Her forms have twice been lost in the post, she said. ""I don't receive correspondence, I don't receive phone calls, I have to chase them all the time,"" she said. Theresa May, Tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ""We have got to find a way that's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them."" The agency's former chief executive Doug Smith quit last autumn claiming he was ""seriously disappointed"" with its performance. The committee said the National Audit Office should investigate why the EDS system had gone so badly wrong. It blamed the agency's senior management for a ""multitude of problems"" within the agency, including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff.

"Boothroyd calls for Lords speaker

Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber.

Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. ""Now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it,"" she told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. In 1999 Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords' 750 hereditary peers. That was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution. The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto.

""I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons,"" Lord Falconer told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. ""How it interacts with the Commons is a very, very important issue. ""We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes."" The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker. He is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary.

Lady Boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of Speaker. ""I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords,"" she said. ""I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords. ""I want somebody there who is going to look after that House and do a job there.

"Bid to cut court witness stress

New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.

Lord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. More video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. It is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.

Ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs' plan, Lord Falconer said: ""One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. ""The needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.

""Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant."" He went on: ""Giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you're a victim. ""Yet with a will and with support it can be done."" Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. ""You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,"" he said. ""But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it's not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.""

The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday. Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this. Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament. The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament. What they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added.

"Lord Scarman, 93, dies peacefully

Distinguished lawyer Lord Scarman, who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 Brixton riots, has died aged 93.

The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years. He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the ""great advocates of our generation"".

""His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial. ""His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.

""A great judge, a great lawyer and a great man."" Lord Scarman's nephew George Ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on Wednesday, would be ""sadly missed"".

The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, who is the most senior judge in England and Wales, said it was Lord Scarman's ""pioneering work"" which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998. ""He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,"" he said. ""He was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.""

Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the Family Justice Division, said Lord Scarman was a ""good and humane judge"" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.

The inquiry famously settled on the so-called ""rotten apples"" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority. Trevor Phillips, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, praised Lord Scarman's ""ability to listen"". He said: ""When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying. ""A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment. ""His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings. ""He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots.""

"Tory leader urges Harry apology

Prince Harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a Nazi uniform to a friend's fancy dress party, says Tory leader Michael Howard.

Mr Howard, whose grandmother died in Auschwitz, said many people would be offended by the prince's actions Clarence House has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume. Number 10 said an error was made but now Harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace. That was a message repeated by Home Secretary Charles Clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie.

But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. ""There is a reservoir of goodwill for Prince Harry, and Prince William with him, in this country, but I think he needs to remember that it can't last forever."" He added that Sandhurst would probably be good for Harry as it would teach him some self discipline. Former Labour MP Lord Janner, who is a high profile member of Britain's Jewish community, branded Harry's action's ""stupid and evil"". He told ITV: ""The time has come for him to make a public apology. It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust."" He added: ""I would send him in the army as fast as possible. I hope that would teach him not to behave like that.""

A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursday's Sun newspaper under the headline: ""Harry the Nazi."" Mr Howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is."" Mr Howard declined to say what form the statement should take. But former Buckingham Palace press spokesman Dicky Arbiter said the prince should make a personal, broadcast apology. Mr Clarke said he recognised people's concerns about the costume but argued: ""He has apologised and I think we should leave the matter there.""

"NHS waiting time target is cut

Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.

Welsh Health Minister Jane Hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, against a current target of 18 months. But she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for March 2006. The announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop. This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.

Details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the New Year. In England, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months. Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets ""to make further and faster progress on waiting lists"". ""However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England,"" he said. ""Capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that Welsh patients don't receive a worse service than patients over the border."" Health analyst Tony Beddow, from the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, called the new targets ""reasonably impressive"".

On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced £264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.

Ms Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting ""unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year"". ""We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales. Now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again,"" she said. She added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant. ""But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long."" Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Plaid Cymru health spokesman said: ""It's exactly the same target she set in 1999, with the qualification that it's dependent on a second offer. It's a failed target, from a failed minister..with a failed policy."" For the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams called the new target ""hugely unambitious"". ""It leaves patients in Wales still waiting two years before they're treated."" Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: ""We're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof. ""The Audit Commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively, and that's quite a criticism."" Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%. Statistics to the end of November showed a decline since October from 785 to 708. The number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7,613 to 6,630, or 12.9%. Ms Hutt said they were ""excellent figures"". There are 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.

"Tories plan migrant health checks

Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.

A positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. Labour said many tests were already done. The Lib Dems warned both parties against ""pandering to prejudice"".

The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. ""It's very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. ""Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,"" said Mr Howard.

""I don't think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem."" But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims. The proposals include:

- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a ""high incidence TB country"" will have to undergo a chest X-ray. 
 - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to ""demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health"". 
 - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to ""impose significant costs or demands"" on the NHS. 
 - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a ""case by case basis"".

There is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected. And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well."" The government says the Tories are ""a bit late"" to the issue. Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: ""We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. ""Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK."" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: ""This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. ""Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one."" Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. ""In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,"" she said.

"MPs issued with Blackberry threat

MPs will be thrown out of the Commons if they use Blackberries in the chamber Speaker Michael Martin has ruled.

The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send e-mails. The devices gained new prominence this week after Alastair Campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a Newsnight journalist. Mr Martin revealed some MPs had been using their Blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces.

The use of electronic devices in the Commons chamber has long been frowned on. The sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the Speaker or his deputies. The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House. He or she is always an MP chosen by colleagues who, once nominated, gives up all party political allegiances.

"Wales 'must learn health lessons'

The new health minister for Wales says there are lessons to learn from England in tackling waiting lists.

Dr Brian Gibbons, on his first full day in the job after Jane Hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats said Dr Gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile Ms Hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr Gibbons, who was a GP in Blaengwynfi, in the Upper Afan Valley, before becoming AM for Aberavon, said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales.

In November the British Medical Association said NHS staff were ""weeping with despair"" as figures showed 311,000 people were waiting for treatment in Wales, up by 2,400 on the previous month. In the same month lists in England were at their lowest for 17 years, with 856,600 people waiting for treatment. Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales: ""There is no doubt that, in managing waiting lists, England has done a lot of very very useful work, and we do need to learn from that.""

But he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health, and a balanced view of priorities was important. ""We do need a consistent across-the-board approach, recognising the patients' experience of how they use the service is going to be, at the end of the day, the main test of how the service is working."" He said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". Later, Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt, saying he ""agreed with everything she's done"" to change the health service in Wales. Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem, but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out, the rest of the assembly government's health policy would be overshadowed.

Opposition members and some Labour MPs had long called for Ms Hutt's removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times. First Minister Rhodri Morgan told BBC Wales he had agreed with Ms Hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the 2007 elections. ""She's been doing the job for five years and eight months and, apart from Nye Bevan himself, (architect of the NHS), I don't think anybody has ever done the job for so long."" Mr Morgan said he had only told Ms Hutt of the reshuffle on Monday morning, and said the NHS in Wales was Dr Gibbons' ""baby"" now. In response to Dr Gibbons' comments, Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly, said: ""It is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic."" Kisrty Williams, for the Lib Dems, added: ""If the underlying policy is going to continue, then changing the minister will serve no purpose, other than to deflect flak from Labour's MPs,"" she said. Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped ""that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months"" Asked about waiting lists, she said that waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda"" and that the Welsh Assembly Government had ""turned the corner"" on the issue.

"UKIP candidate suspended

Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.

John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: ""We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: ""He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. ""By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. ""It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies."" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: ""I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.""

Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. ""He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken."" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: ""I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.""

"End Bush 'denial' Blair tells EU

Tony Blair is urging European leaders to wake up from their ""state of denial"" over President Bush's re-election.

""America has spoken. The rest of the world should listen,"" the prime minister said in an interview with The Times newspaper, published on Friday. Mr Blair is at a summit in Brussels, where Iraq and European justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. French President Jacques Chirac reacted to his warning by saying Europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. Mr Blair has probably been closer to President Bush than any other European leader.

He said some people were in ""a sort of state of denial"" about the US election result but predicted a more ""receptive mood"" would emerge soon. America needed to listen to the world too, he said. ""The fact is that President Bush is there for four years. He is there because the American people have chosen him,"" he argued. He also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together.

Britain was ""uniquely placed"" to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the US, he suggested. He admitted he had gone to bed at 2230GMT, well before the American polls closed, thinking Mr Kerry might have won. He woke up at 0530GMT to discover Mr Bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. His words about President Bush met a cool reception from Jacques Chirac. The French president told reporters: ""Europe today has more than ever the need, the necessity, to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity. ""That is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever.""

Mr Chirac will miss an address to the summit from Iraqi interim leader Iyad Allawi, who this week criticised nations which took a ""spectator"" role to Iraq's reconstruction. Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates' late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi. He also signed a communiqu&#233; stressing the EU's commitment to securing a stable and unified Iraq. The EU also confirmed a new $21m aid package. The communiqu&#233; congratulated President Bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. The summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline European asylum and immigration decisions. Mr Blair recently said the UK would only participate in EU-wide measures where it was in UK interests but the Tories say he is surrendering a key veto. The meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe more competitive.

"Brown to outline presidency goals

Next year will be ""make or break"" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.

The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.

He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.""

His proposals were effectively a new ""Marshall Plan"" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.

Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. ""That is why next year is a test,"" he said. ""If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results."" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown's speech on Wednesday.

Cafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. Oxfam's Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The charity's director, Barbara Stocking, said: ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure."" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.

But 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing ""guff"" about scars on the world. It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005. Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. ""There's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,"" added Mr Duncan.

"Brown shrugs off economy fears

Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.

In an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK ""industrial history"" but denied he was ""gloating"". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown ""Sir Wastealot"".

The shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's ""golden rule"" had ""turned to dross in his hands"" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn. Mr Letwin told MPs: ""The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money.""

Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.

He said: ""Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. ""There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted."" Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.

Mr Brown's insistence he was not ""gloating"" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election.

It includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a ""welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history"", said Mr Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.

Mr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt ""low and sustainable"" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast. He also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. Simon Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""The proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.""

"UK troops on Ivory Coast standby

Downing Street has confirmed British troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred UK citizens from Ivory Coast.

The news came as it emerged France had begun evacuating its hostages after days of anti-French demonstrations. Trouble flared after nine French peacekeepers were killed and President Jacques Chirac ordered the destruction of the Ivory Coast's air force. A company of 100-120 UK troops is understood to have been put on standby. They are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: ""There are British nationals in Ivory Coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further, but that's all I can say at this stage.""

He added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. France has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in Ivory Coast - a former colony - after President Laurent Gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine French soldiers. The decision to destroy the African nation's small air force prompted riots against French and other foreign nationals. The Spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.

"Blair told to double overseas aid

Tony Blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid.

Some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, Oxfam says in a report, Paying the Price. The call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the G8 of top industrialised nations. ""As rich countries get richer, they're giving less and less. This scandal must stop,"" Oxfam's Barbara Stocking said.

""The world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives. ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure,"" the charity's director added. The report said: ""For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity."" It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.

It argues that the price of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development will be felt across the world. The report said: ""Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. ""Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. Poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. ""New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. ""Criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.""

Both the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world's poor nations. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: ""The government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. ""If Britain's proposal for an International Finance Facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008-09. ""These additional resources will be used to increase UK bilateral aid to Africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on HIV/Aids related work over the next three years.""

"Peace demo appeal rejected

Peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an anti-war demonstration days after the start of the Iraq war.

They had appealed against a High Court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near RAF Fairford, Glos, in 2003. The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. Sitting on Wednesday, three Appeal Court judges dismissed both appeals. They were challenging decisions by two judges in the High Court in February this year. It followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to RAF Fairford and forced to return to London under police escort. The demonstrators appealed against a finding by Lord Justice May and Mr Justice Harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.

The police were urging Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices Clarke and Rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. Craig Mackey, assistant chief constable of Gloucestershire Police, said: ""We have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence."" He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields. ""Given these circumstances, and the fact that RAF Fairford, and other military installations in the UK, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. ""From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford."" Fairford Coach Action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Their action is supported by Amnesty International and Liberty.

The ""myth that ageing is a barrier"" to contributing to society needs to be ""exploded"", the work and pensions minister has said.

This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said. It was also committed to ""stamping out"" age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing. All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.

Mr Johnson told Age Concern's Age Agenda in London the government was ""seriously considering"" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy, while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. Mr Johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system. This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said. Speaking at the London conference he said: ""Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination"".

The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were ""increasingly consigned to the past"". ""We're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously. ""And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded"". Mr Johnson said his department had a long-term aspiration of moving towards an 80% employment rate. This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force, he said.

"Jowell rejects 'Las Vegas' jibe

The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.

She told the Guardian newspaper there would be no ""Las Vegas-style"" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes ""a pile of pants"". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. ""You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,"" Mr Pound told the Today programme. ""I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,"" he said.

Ms Jowell complained of the ""scale of misrepresentation"" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to ""protect children and the vulnerable"" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: ""We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing."" And continued: ""We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way."" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.

"Ban on hunting comes into force

Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.

The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. He said police would challenge the ""one of two isolated hunts"" which are threatening to break the law.

But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. ""The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. ""You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,"" he said.

The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police ""in the near future"" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. He has rejected a ""blanket policy"" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality. John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. He said police had ""acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences"".

The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.

As well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to ""flush out"" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. ""We are not going away. We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again,"" hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said. But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that ""people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about"". He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. ""Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting,"" he said.

"Blair says UK tsunami aid to soar

Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give ""hundreds of millions"" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.

The prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in Egypt. Mr Blair insisted he had been ""intimately involved"" in ""all decisions at all times"" despite being abroad. He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead.

The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing. Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.

""I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives."" The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the £50m given by the government so far only ""six or seven million"" had been spent. It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. ""My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people,"" he said. Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. ""As you can see unfortunately I am still looking the same as I always did,"" he joked.

The prime minister took personal charge of the UK's response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day. He also spoke on the telephone to US President George Bush, and the presidents of Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.

Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in ""intensive talks"" with other G8 finance ministers. Germany proposed a freeze last week and Canada has begun its own moratorium. The chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (£1.58bn) in repayments. Tory leader Michael Howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been ""playing catch-up"" with public donations.

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week. During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday. On Friday, he will visit the Thai beach resort of Phuket, where British families are still searching for relatives.

International Development Secretary Hilary Benn will also visit Aceh in Indonesia, as well as Sri Lanka. The British public has now pledged £76m in aid with emergency supplies from the British government starting to arrive in the region on three RAF flights in a joint operation with Scandinavian countries. Two ships - the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Diligence and frigate HMS Chatham - have arrived in the disaster area. A second Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Bayleaf, is also being sent. UK charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.


 - A BBC News Special: Asia Remembered, including the three-minutes silence, will be shown on BBC One and BBC News 24 from 1130 to 1215 GMT on Wednesday.

"Straw attacked on China arms

Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.

The 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban. But Human Rights Watch says the EU is putting commerce above abuse concerns.

In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. Germany and France have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections.

He expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: ""This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square. ""There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for.""

Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. ""The code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China,"" he said.

Mr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be ""profoundly wrong"". The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.

Mr Ancram argued: ""What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... ""It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong."" Mr Straw's China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers. He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and China's part in the talks on North Korea.

"Defiant hunts put ban to the test

Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.

The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law. Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. One anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent.

The man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford. In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.

It is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.

They were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters. Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.

Mike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police. ""Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. ""However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain."" BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.

And the BBC's Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback. Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.

Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: ""We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned."" Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was ""impossibly difficult to determine"" and open to different interpretations.

Chief executive Simon Hart said: ""There has been hunting in England for 700 years. This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick. ""It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say."" Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police ""in the near future"" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.

"EU fraud clampdown urged

EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said.

The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud. It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts. The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. The report said: ""Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.

""As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources."" It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth £808m to 8,177 cases worth £644m. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency.

""Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community,"" he said. ""Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. ""The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management."" A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting. ""The quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state, and there is room for improvement,"" spokesman Jorg Wojahn said. He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a ""good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud"".

"Straw praises Kashmir moves

The UK has welcomed the decision by India and Pakistan to open a bus link across the ceasefire line dividing the disputed region of Kashmir.

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, touring South East Asian countries, praised the ""spirit of cooperation"" in achieving the breakthrough. Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process. Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris. The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday. Kashmiri politicians on both sides of the Line of Control which divides the region welcomed the move.

In a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad ""will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades"". ""This will make a real difference to the lives of Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control,"" he said. ""I warmly applaud the efforts of both India and Pakistan to make this happen. ""This spirit of cooperation will, I hope, lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region.""

On Thursday Mr Straw was in India visiting Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar where he tried his hand at making Indian bread or roti. He is due to take part in talks with the Indian government on Friday. A second bus service linking the Pakistani city of Lahore with Amritsar in India was also announced as well as a rail link between Rajasthan state and Pakistan's Sindh province. Both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in Karachi and Mumbai (Bombay). The mountainous region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than 50 years.

"UK helps raped Rwandan women

Britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the Rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with HIV/Aids.

An estimated 25,000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic Hutu leader. The five-year Department for International Development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.

The plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. It was overshadowed by Rwanda's emergence from the 100 days of slaughter, during which time the mass killings took place, and the women's fate was largely a taboo subject. But many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but, in many cases, orphans too.

As the women die, the number of Rwanda's orphans rises. Until recently, very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. That is now starting to change. This funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2,500 women. Mary Kayitesi Blewitt, founder of the Survivors Fund (SURF), one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled, said it was a recognition, before it was too late, that the survivors should be a priority for help.

"Howard denies split over ID cards

Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.

The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a ""collective view"" after holding a ""good discussion"", but admitted it was ""not an easy issue"". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.

Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans ""stink"". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would ""set out the position very clearly"" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could ""help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives"". He added: ""When the police say that you have to take them seriously"".

He acknowledged there were ""good libertarian arguments"" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the ""conflicting interests"" before reaching its decision. ""I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" He also denied he was afraid of looking ""soft"" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.

Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and ""deeply flawed"". He said: ""This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.""

The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained."" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.

"EU referendum question unveiled

The question to be asked in the referendum on the EU Constitution has been unveiled by the government.

It will be: ""Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?"" The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote in the referendum, expected in 2006. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. ""If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,"" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a ""yes"" vote.

Patriots by definition wanted the UK to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad, Mr Straw said. ""Our role as a leading member of the EU is a crucial part of securing that.""

Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question ""seems straightforward"". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as ""two separate issues"". Despite this ""underhand trick,"" the referendum bill stood ""no chance of becoming law before the election,"" he added. ""This is Tony Blair's cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on Europe he knows he cannot win."" Neil O'Brien, director of anti-constitution group Vote No, said: ""The reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the EU constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.""

The UK Independence Party said: ""If the government believes that a No vote would mean that we should leave the European Union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the EU. Then we can be out of it and better off much sooner.""

Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The sooner we get on with this, the better."" He said the question sounded ""very neutral"" and ""balanced,"" adding it would enable the argument ""to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides"". Green MEP Caroline Lucas welcomed Tony Blair's ""courage in keeping his word"" on holding a referendum. But she added: ""This treaty is a flawed document that will make the EU less accountable, less sustainable, and less just.""

Mr Blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in Rome in November, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. That promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a ""British vision for Europe"" and gives ""national governments a stronger grip"", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Blair refused to be pinned down to that date, saying Britain would hold a poll ""some time in 2006 but when, I don't know"". The paper said the prime minister ""claimed ignorance"" of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.

"Malik rejects all-black MP lists

A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.

Shahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.

Mr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. ""If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,"" he said. He added: ""It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate."" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.

But he argued: ""I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective."" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as ""painful"". ""I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,"" she said. ""The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people."" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was ""ambitious"" to improve black and Asian representation. ""We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,"" he said.

"MP attacked by muggers in Kenya

An MP has had more than £600 and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in Kenya.

Quentin Davies, the MP for Grantham and Stamford, was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital, Nairobi. He was not hurt in the mugging on Saturday evening. Several people are being questioned over the attack. He was in Kenya before travelling to Sudan with the Parliamentary committee. Local police were said to be ""surprised"" he was in the area. Mr Davies, 60, said the mugging occurred 100 yards from the Nairobi Serena Hotel and equally close to the Anglican Cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk.

He said in a statement: ""It was a frightening experience. ""Six men managed to steal up on me and grab me from behind. ""I knew I had to stay very calm and passive - you cannot fight six men"". He had to spend an extra 24 hours in Nairobi before rejoining the rest of the House of Commons International Development Committee in Dafur after the mugging. ""Naturally, I was afraid they would use a knife or gun, though they never produced any weapon,"" he said. ""Two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets.""

"Candidate resigns over BNP link

A prospective candidate for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) has resigned after admitting a ""brief attachment"" to the British National Party(BNP).

Nicholas Betts-Green, who had been selected to fight the Suffolk Coastal seat, quit after reports in a newspaper that he attended a BNP meeting. The former teacher confirmed he had attended the meeting but said that was the only contact he had with the group. Mr Betts-Green resigned after being questioned by the party's leadership. A UKIP spokesman said Mr Betts-Green's resignation followed disclosures in the East Anglian Daily Times last month about his attendance at a BNP meeting. ""He did once attend a BNP meeting. He did not like what he saw and heard and will take no further part of it,"" the spokesman added. A meeting of Suffolk Coastal UKIP members is due to be held next week to discuss a replacement. Mr Betts-Green, of Woodbridge, Suffolk, has also resigned as UKIP's branch chairman.

"'Nuclear dumpsite' plan attacked

Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded ""deeply irresponsible"" by the Liberal Democrats.

The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a ""nuclear dumpsite"".

Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a ""sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries"". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.

Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: ""I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. ""Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. ""This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. ""The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. ""The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck.""

"Labour accused of broken pledge

Labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card, the Tories have claimed.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke has been quoted as telling Labour members he wants more migrants to come to the UK. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said the comments were at odds with Tony Blair's prediction of a net cut in immigration. But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score ""cheap political points"" by muddling immigration with asylum.

London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. ""That's not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country,"" he said.

""We want more migration, more people come to study and to work. ""We want more people coming to look for refuge."" Mr Blair's was asked last Wednesday if the government's new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration. The prime minister told MPs: ""The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall.""

On Monday, Dr Fox told reporters: ""The prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week. ""The Labour Party election pledges, even when they are so incredibly vague, do not even last four days.""

The Tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on Tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants. Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack. ""This is simply a scurrilous attempt by the Tories to score cheap political points,"" he said. ""The Tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum.""

Mr Clarke said he had made clear the UK would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system. And only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted. ""Under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall,"" he added. Earlier, Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about Tory policies and then attacking the lies. He told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" The latest pre-election spats come after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a ""hard right agenda"" which would take Britain backwards.

"Labour trio 'had vote-rig factory'

Three Labour councillors in Birmingham were caught operating a ""vote-rigging factory"", an Election Court has heard.

Police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in June 2004, the hearing was told. The votes were later counted towards that month's English local elections. The men, elected to the Aston ward, deny collecting votes fraudulently. The judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.

The special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month. The case against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam and Mohammed Kazi is being brought by local Liberal Democrat supporters. They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election. Ravi Sukul, counsel for the petitioners, accused the three men of being ""deeply involved"" in illegal practices. Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.

The police were alerted and called to the premises. Mr Sukul said: ""When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present. ""Hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table."" The police officers left the warehouse, but were later ordered back to seize the documents. ""When the officers left, all the envelopes and papers were scattered,"" Mr Sukul said.

""(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed. The house was in order."" Interrupting Mr Sukul in his opening, Mr Mawrey said: ""What you are saying is, these men were operating a vote-forging factory on an industrial estate."" The court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning, where they were mixed in with other ballots. The case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other Birmingham councillors in the Bordesley Green ward, claims which are denied. Mr Mawrey is due to deliver a judgment in their case once the Aston petition has been heard. Mr Afzal, Mr Islam and Mr Kazi deny conspiring to commit election fraud to deceive the returning officer. The case continues.

"Blair returns from peace mission

Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.

Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March. Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.

The BBC's Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was ""in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit"". He added: ""Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose."" In an interview with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be ""tough, but at least we have got the first step"". Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism. He argued that Mr Sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from Gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it. Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen ""the slightest step"" the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city. He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. He also flew to Basra in southern Iraq where British forces are stationed.

"Galloway plea for hostage release

Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, kidnapped in Iraq.

Mrs Hassan, 59, who led Care International operations in Iraq, was abducted in Baghdad on 19 October. Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on Iraq. He denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the Al-Jazeera Arabic television channel.

Speaking in London on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the Respect Coalition, he said: ""I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations. ""But this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions. ""I am prepared to do anything I can to help save her life."" A spokesman later said Mr Galloway had friends in common with Ms Hassan, who he described as a prominent anti-war activist, and that he was ""willing to do anything - go to Iraq or be an intermediary or anything that's necessary"". Since her abduction, several videos of Mrs Hassan have been broadcast by Al-Jazeera. The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq. She also urged Care International, the aid agency she works for, to close its office in Baghdad, and appealed for Iraqi women prisoners to be freed. Care has since closed down all its operations in Iraq.

"Guantanamo four questioned

The four Britons freed from US custody in Guantanamo Bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.

Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links. Mr Begg's father, Azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was ""a hero"". The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers. But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he was concerned for his son Moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. As Azmat Begg arrived at the London police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was ""absolutely"" inadmissible in UK courts. In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK.

He told the newspaper: ""If an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. ""The options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. If not they will be released as soon as possible."" The men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. Louise Christian said that after being ""tortured and abused"" at Guantanamo Bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. She told BBC News she remained very concerned about their psychological state. Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. Washington has claimed all four were ""enemy combatants"" who trained at camps run by al-Qaeda. The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies.

The detainees were immediately arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when they landed at RAF Northolt, west London, on Tuesday. Massoud Shadjareh, from the Muslim Safety Forum, said: ""What sort of homecoming is this? They are innocent people."" The Muslim Council of Britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help. ""We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family,"" said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council.

"Minister defends hunting ban law

The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and ""very clear"", Alun Michael has said.

The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not. Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a ""massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting"". People had turned out ""to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law"", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed ""legally"" as far as he was aware.

Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: ""There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. ""The reality is that the law is very clear. You can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. ""If people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear. You can't hunt accidentally."" Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.

But the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. There were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act.

They have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed ""gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes"". If people tried to ""run circles around this law"" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said. Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.

"Clarke to unveil immigration plan

New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. Tony Blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no ""magic bullet"". The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system.

The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May. Ministers deny they have been spurred into action by Tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done.

Instead, they say the plans are part of an ""evolving"" process aimed at winning public confidence. Mr Clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants' families, and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants. The prime minister on Sunday said immigration would be ""toughened up"" to ensure only those immigrants with skills the UK really needs will be granted work permits. But he rejected the Tories' call for a quota on economic migrants, saying no ""arbitrary figure"" could reflect the UK's needs.

Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""We should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs... ""The public are worried about this, they are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system."" But he defended the UK's current regime, saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse. Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair.

He said: ""We will not be... pretending there is some simple easy way of processing Britain's asylum seekers in some other country, because no such other country exists."" Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said the government had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a ""shambles"". ""What we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure,"" he said. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said Labour was right to reject the Tories' idea of quotas on asylum. But he said it was yet to be seen if Mr Clarke could deliver ""a fair and efficient asylum system"".

"Mayor will not retract Nazi jibe

London mayor Ken Livingstone has again refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a Jewish reporter.

Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is ""standing by"" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a ""concentration camp guard"". At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. He said to media representatives: ""If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong."" The mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 Olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs, who arrived in London on Tuesday. ""I think it is important that the IOC (International Olympic Committee) members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic, change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget,"" he said.

On Tuesday, the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. Two motions were passed by the London Assembly, which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor's activities, on Monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments. The mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of ""examples of intrusion by journalists"" into his, and his family's private life. ""I don't suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the Holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history. ""But when reporters say to me I'm only doing this because it's my job... that's the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard.

""We are responsible for our own choices in this life, I always have been and so have reporters."" An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspended or bar him from office but Mr Livingstone said: ""There must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years.

""I have never in response to any of that modified a policy I believed to be right or modified a position I believed to be right and I don't intend to now. ""Because if I do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers."" On tape Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking reporter Oliver Finegold if he is a ""German war criminal"". Mr Finegold replies: ""No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that."" The mayor then says: ""Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?""

"Pakistani women 'must not hide'

Hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of Islam, President Musharraf of Pakistan has said during a visit to Britain.

He was speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the Pakistani community in Manchester. ""My wife is travelling around. She is very religious but she is very moderate,"" said General Musharraf. It comes after Pakistan's High Commissioner to Britain said some Pakistanis should integrate more. Dr Maleeha Lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.

Gen Musharraf told the BBC: ""Some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong."" The Pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe. ""Yes, absolutely. And I would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems, so therefore we can never address it in its totality,"" he said. ""We are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic long-term context.

""It is the political disputes and we need to resolve them, and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty. This combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism."" On Monday the Pakistani president met Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, on his first official visit to London. He is due to visit the Pakistani community in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon.

The Mirror newspaper said on Tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of Gen Musharraf's visit to Britain. The paper said the document had been found in a London street by a member of the public. It said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels, call signs and codes. Speaking in London on Monday, Gen Musharraf said al-Qaeda was ""on the run"" in Pakistan.

But standing next to Mr Blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the ""core of what creates terrorists, what creates an extremist, militant environment which then leads on to terrorism"". ""That is the resolution of political disputes.""

Mr Blair said the two leaders had talked about Afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir. ""We agreed that in Afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there,"" said Mr Blair. ""In respect of Iraq, we agreed that whatever the issues of the past, the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that Iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.""

"Visa row mandarin made Sir John

The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.

Sir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.

Both men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.

The Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a ""collective failure"" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.

Downing Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: ""You have to look at their whole career."" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith's honour: ""The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.

""In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes."" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.

"Kilroy-Silk attacked with slurry

Euro MP Robert Kilroy-Silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in Manchester.

The UK Independence Party member was arriving for a BBC radio show when the attacker emerged from behind a bush. Fellow guest Ruth Kelly MP was also hit by the slurry. Mr Kilroy-Silk said the man, who later disappeared, claimed he was ""doing it in the name of Islam"". In January, Mr Kilroy-Silk quit his BBC One show for remarks he made about Arabs, who he called ""suicide bombers"".

Mr Kilroy-Silk had already been taken off air by BBC bosses for the comments, in which he also described Arabs as ""limb-amputators, women repressors"". The remarks prompted outrage among Muslim groups. The slurry attack took place on Friday as Mr Kilroy-Silk and Ms Kelly, a Cabinet Office minister and Bolton West MP, arrived at Manchester High School for Girls for the recording of BBC Radio 4's Any Questions.

The police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. They are treating the incident as assault. The programme's host, Jonathan Dimbleby, later told the audience the MEP had been covered from ""head to toe"". Mr Kilroy-Silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.

He told reporters he was ""very angry"" and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. He said the man shouted: ""You've offended my religion, I'm doing this in the name of Islam."" ""As I started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car,"" Mr Kilroy-Silk said. ""I was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven. It went all inside the car and splattered Ruth Kelly."" A BBC spokesman said: ""He took his seat as Jonathan Dimbleby was introducing the show. Fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have."" Greater Manchester Police said people near Mr Kilroy-Silk had also been hit by the waste. Officers took statements at the scene, but no arrests have been made. Police say the suspect ran off after towards Wilmslow Road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red Vauxhall Corsa earlier. The suspect is described as white, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger beard. Police want to hear from anyone who has any information.

Mr Kilroy-Silk, an MEP for the East Midlands, resigned the UK Independence Party whip in the European Parliament in October, after criticising UKIP and stating his ambition to be leader. However, he remains a member of the party. He said on Friday he hoped to be elected party leader before Christmas. ""I think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the General Election."" But a UKIP spokesman said that would be impossible under the party's constitution, which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.

"Petrol duties frozen, Brown says

Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the Commons on Thursday.

Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. But this financial year, because of ""volatility in the oil market"", he said the duty would be frozen. During 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. He said: ""It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services. ""But this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market I propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.""

The RAC welcomed the news, calling it an ""early Christmas present"" for motorists. But the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. Environmental group Transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists. ""We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action,"" said a spokesman. In 2000 the People's Fuel Lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after Mr Brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. The chancellor did not raise duty that year, but despite threats of more protests in 2003, he added 1.28p per litre.

"Howard unveils election platform

The Conservatives would stand up for the ""forgotten majority"", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.

The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a ""failed Tory past"". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.

Campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.

In a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the ""forgotten majority"" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: ""They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.""

Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue ""down the path of ever rising taxes"". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall ""bureaucrats"". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. ""The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,"" he says.

Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: ""I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep."" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting ""clear blue water"" between himself and his opponents.

Labour's election slogan will be: ""Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again"". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of ""launching Thatcherism in instalments"" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. ""The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,"" he said.

"Lawyer attacks anti-terror laws

A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name.

Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign.

Mr MacDonald told BBC News: ""The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. ""The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. ""I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally"".

Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. ""My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. ""As far as I'm concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this."" he added.

The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday. According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare. They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. Mr MacDonald said he had ""no idea"" whether further resignations would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyers may go. ""I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,"" he said. ""They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.""

Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. ""When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review,"" she said. ""Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.""

"Turkey deal 'to help world peace'

A deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership is of ""fundamental importance"" to the peace and security of the world, Tony Blair has said.

The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were ""wrong"", Mr Blair said. It represented the achievement of an ""historic British objective"", he added. Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was ""anti-Islamic"".

Turkey's involvement with the EU would provide an ""invaluable bridge"" between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added. But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey. Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. He insisted that the Turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus.

It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership. The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a ""red line"". It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed. If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005. However, talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

"Protect whistleblowers, TUC says

The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said.

It said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 ""safety whistleblowers"" had lost their jobs since 1999. Some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions, it said. The Health and Safety Executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer. The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.

Safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation. General secretary Brendan Barber said: ""It shouldn't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. ""Workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety."" Mr Barber, who said the ""problem is far worse than official statistics show"", called for a legal system that ""protects safety whistleblowers"". He added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, ""stand little chance of redress.""

Rory O' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: ""Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. ""Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century. ""It would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect."" The TUC has called on the government to appoint ""roving"" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections. The Health and Safety Executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer, with more worker involvement.

"Kinnock to urge reform in Lords

Neil Kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the House of Lords will allow him to help ""achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform.""

On the BBC's Breakfast with Frost it was put to Mr Kinnock that he had once referred to Lords members as ""brigands, muggers, bribers and gangsters"". But the outgoing European Commissioner said his comments - made some 26 years ago - needed to be put in context. He said advocates for reform needed to be inside the Lords to vote for it. ""It was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the Lords and people there willing to vote for it.""

Mr Kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the British Council. ""History demonstrates that it's immensely useful for the British Council to have its chairman in the House of Lords and that was a conclusive factor."" Mr Kinnock said he thought about the decision for ""quite a long time"" because he had long had reservations about the Lords. But he added: ""The process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently, and consequently I did take all these factors into consideration because it's not a decision to be made glibly."" The former Labour leader said he would probably take the title of Lord Kinnock of Bedwellty - his first constituency for which he was selected in 1969.

"McConnell details Scots wave toll

At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs.

The figures came out during a statement by Jack McConnell to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. He formally expressed Scotland's sympathy for the victims of the Indian Ocean tidal wave which killed 150,000. Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort. He said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.

Mr McConnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. He said he was proud of the generous response of people in Scotland to the disaster appeal, which is expected soon to top £20m. The first minister also praised Scottish Water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone. The Scottish Executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies.

But he said Scotland was ""in it for the long term"" with help planned for fishing communities, for children's services, and for the aid charities. He said 2005 must be the year that Scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world, whether in Asia or in Africa. Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities, trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July. Edinburgh architect, Dominic Stephenson, became the first Scot to be confirmed as a victim of the Asian tsunami. The 27-year-old was holidaying on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi with Eileen Lee, 24. She is still missing.

"Police urge pub closure power

New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs.

Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. Mr Fox's comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. He rejected critics' calls for the law change to be delayed. Instead, the new Licensing Act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned, he argued.

Acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee. After the meeting, Mr Fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact. ""If it's 12.30 on a Saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there's not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn't open on Sunday anyway.

""This is about getting through to the management that they can't run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions."" Under Acpo's proposal, the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. The new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.

Mr Fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself. ""It's making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse, and the strategic planning process has been less than useless,"" he said. Mr Fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers. ""Staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people aren't being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street,"" he said. ""We have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. We have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this.""

Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs, councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. It was the status quo, not the new laws, which were causing current binge drinking problems, she told BBC Two's Newsnight. Leaked documents have suggested ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett branded new opening hours as a ""leap in the dark"". But Ms Jowell insisted his concerns had been met. The police's job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.

"Blunkett tells of love and pain

David Blunkett has spoken of his love for married publisher Kimberly Quinn for the first time.

The home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life, but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility. Mr Blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to Mrs Quinn's two-year-old son. She denies he is Mr Blunkett's. The interview with BBC Radio Sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for Mrs Quinn's nanny. The allegations, which he has denied, are being investigated by Sir Alan Budd. Mr Blunkett talked about how he fell in love - but that she resisted his desire to go public.

In an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son, he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences, even when they were painful. Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: ""I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story. ""I tried for three years to make something work. ""I haven't spoken about it and I don't intend to. Even in the biography that's being written about me I've ensured that there's as little as possible."" BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary. Shadow home secretary David Davis says Mr Blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly.

Reports have claimed Mr Blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny Leoncia Casalme's wait. The Home Office has said it would be up to Sir Alan's inquiry to decide if any such meeting was relevant. Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job. ""I work with him every day and I have always been surprised by how focused he is on the job in hand, on working to deal with things,"" she said. She told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme: ""He is just really down for the job and I hope he does (survive).""

"Housing plans criticised by MPs

""Irreversible environmental damage"" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned.

""Sustainable communities"" were being promoted without a real understanding of what ""sustainable"" means, the Environmental Audit Committee said. It said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. He said: ""We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment.""

The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low. Regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax, and builders routinely flout them anyway, it said.

Financing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required. The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said. Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee Peter Ainsworth MP, said: ""The government's housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial. ""I accept the need to improve housing supply but, as things stand, the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers, with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser."" Points raised in the report included:


 - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence. 
 - The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain. 
 - The government should consider a ""national spatial framework"" for England such as those already in place in Scotland and Wales. 
 - The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities. 
 - Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes. 
 - The government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities. 
 

Conservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: ""There is now growing evidence that John Prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England.""

"MPs' murder sentence concern

Murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new MPs' report.

The influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. The MPs also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.

""The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor."" At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. But although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. In July this year Amanda Champion's killer, James Ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.

Amanda's uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: ""Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence."" MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.

The measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.

As a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to ""remove ambiguity"" over how murderers should be sentenced. It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. The committee said the plans had not reflected the ""public disquiet"" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. Lord Woolf's Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. As a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.

Mr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliament's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. He said: ""We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances."" But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals. He said: ""By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. ""We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial.""

Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. ""There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,"" he said. But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned the MPs' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. ""The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different,"" he told BBC News.

"'No-one can define new hunt ban'

The new law banning hunting with dogs is ""so poorly drafted"" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.

The accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to ""chase away unwanted animals"" from his farm. Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.

North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra. He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act. Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defra's lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was ""not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence"".

Mr Opik said: ""Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act. ""Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - 'chasing away' which isn't even covered by the Act. ""However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. ""How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away?"" Tory MP Peter Luff, another co-chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was ""so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence"".

""It is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. However, I seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating."" Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: ""There is no confusion, it is a matter of simple common sense. ""If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence. ""If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting.""

"Hospital suspends 'no Welsh' plan

An English hospital has suspended plans to stop treating Welsh patients who have waited more than three months.

Hereford County Hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. GPs in Wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. But after talks with Powys Health Board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in January. Hereford Hospital Trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. Shocked health officials in Powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. Andy Williams, chief executive of Powys Local Health Board, had said it was ""a totally unacceptable way to behave"".

Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was ""struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys"". He had told BBC Radio Wales: ""I have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients I am paying them to treat."" But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there. He said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between England and Wales.

The target is 12 months for Welsh patients, but just three months in England. The contract with the Powys health board was worth £7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients. In a statement before the suspension of the idea, the Welsh Assembly Government said the situation was ""unacceptable"". ""But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate,"" said the assembly government. ""Although we will be challenging Hereford's decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients. They will be contacted by their GPs in the next week."" Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: ""It is with real regret that we have taken this step. ""We want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to Powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service. ""In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital. ""We appeal to Powys Local Health Board to allow Powys people to choose Hereford for their treatment.""

"Tories pledge free sports lessons

Children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future Tory government, the party has said.

The Club2School policy would provide up to £250m yearly for local sports clubs in the UK to deliver after-school sport. The extra coaching would be funded by the National Lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. Shadow home secretary David Davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.

The plans would help tackle the ""fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world"", he said. Shadow sports minister Lord Moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy. ""We aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the UK."" The Tories say Labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. Government figures show that in England in 2002 only a third of schools at Key Stages 1, 3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at Key Stage 2, met that target. The Tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only £41m had been spent. But the Big Lottery Fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.

"Faith schools citizenship warning

Schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.

Independent faith schools were singled out by Ofsted chief, David Bell, for not doing enough to promote the ""wider tenets of British society"". Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be ""intolerant of intolerance"". Diversity ""certainly must not mean segregated or separate"", he said. Mr Bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.

Badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.

Mr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a ""common heritage"" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. ""I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society,"" said Mr Bell. The Ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to Muslim schools. ""Many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony."" Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were ""tricky issues"". But he argued that ""we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation"". ""I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,"" said Mr Bell.

"Ministers lose slopping out case

The Scottish Executive has lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison.

Armed robber Robert Napier, 25, won £2,450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint, eczema, when slopping out at Barlinnie Prison. Napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights. On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.

The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates. More than 310 actions have already been raised in the Court of Session and sheriff courts in Scotland. An executive spokesman said: ""We will study this judgement in detail. Much has changed to address the issues raised in the Napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at Barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated. ""Today's judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases."" Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought £5,000. He was awarded compensation last April after winning his case.

Executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should ""be beyond reasonable doubt"". This is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in Scotland. However, civil litigation is settled on the test of ""a balance of probabilities"". Judge Lord Cullen, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Hamilton, ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. Napier's lawyer Tony Kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others. Mr Kelly said: ""There are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out, overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today's judgement."" Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been ""a fiasco from start to finish"". He said: ""Ministers were fully aware of the state of Scotland's jails. Funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling I suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts. ""A short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost.""

"Escaped prisoner report ordered

First Minister Jack McConnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.

Michael Ferguson, 36, escaped after being allowed out of the high-security Carstairs unit. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave. The Scottish Executive said ministers would be notified but it would ""not be common practice"" to sign approval. An executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. Ministerial responsibility for Carstairs rests with Rhona Brankin, the deputy health minister. Ms Brankin said: ""The first minister has called for a review of what has happened, we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this."" Ms Sturgeon has written to Mr McConnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out. She said questions must be answered about his escape, if the public is to be reassured about safety. Police are still searching for Ferguson, who failed to return after a trip to East Kilbride on Monday.

The Scottish National Party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of Ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers. She said: ""The Scottish Executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of Mr Ferguson was a matter for Carstairs. ""However, my understanding is that, under the mental health legislation, the decision to grant this patient - and any restricted patient - leave of absence, would have required direct and specific authorisation by Scottish ministers."" She added: ""I have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact. I have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on. ""This is not an attempt to apportion blame, but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases.""

Police said Ferguson posed a danger to the public. BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation. He said: ""We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs. ""The executive concedes that it is up to Scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it. ""But at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised."" Scottish Conservative leader, David McLetchie, said earlier it was ""almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen"".

The executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor ""in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers"". She said: ""Ministers were told of that, notified of it, but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off. ""They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision."" Ferguson, who slashed a man in a doctors' surgery in Coatbridge in 1994, had been out to see his fianc&#233;e Annabella Holmes, 47, whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in South Lanarkshire. He is described as being 5ft 9ins tall, slim, with blond hair, blue eyes and a fair complexion. Ferguson was wearing a black jacket, grey jeans, black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen. He has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye. Ms Holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of Ferguson since Monday. Strathclyde Police asked anyone who spots Ferguson to contact Sergeant Keith McDonald on

"Chancellor rallies Labour voters

Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry, telling supporters the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election.

The chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts. Speaking at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead, Mr Brown claimed the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands. He said Tory plans to cut £35bn tax would ""cut deep into public service"".

To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country, he told activists. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: ""I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. ""Never again Tory boom and bust.

""This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more."" Turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.

He said after seven years Labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to ""the only party trusted with the economy"". It was now a ""party not just of employees, but of employers and managers"", he said. In the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly ""warm"" to Mr Brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. The prime minister is to take part later on Saturday in an interactive question and answer session, fielding queries sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign.

"Councils 'must find Gypsy sites'

Ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers, amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.

Councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by Gypsy communities on rural land. More money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister Yvette Cooper. In November, MPs urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop. Ms Cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. That scheme has paid out £25m in four years, with £8m available for 2005.

""There are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning Gypsy and traveller sites,"" said Ms Cooper. ""Firstly, local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. And secondly, they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites. ""The result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the Gypsies and travellers. ""That is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites, as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment."" Under the new regulations, expected to be in force in the spring, officials will be able to serve ""temporary stop notices"" aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. Many MPs with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern England, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.

Andrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: ""We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. ""New accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers, as they often do. ""Living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals, legal action and eviction is no one's idea of fun."" In their November report, MPs from the committee scrutinising the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. Numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities, said the MPs. In turn, the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. Two of the most controversial traveller sites - Cottenham in Cambridgeshire and Minety in Wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.

"Plaid MP's cottage arson claim

A Plaid Cymru MP believes UK security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on Welsh extremists.

It is 25 years since the start of 12 years of fire-bombings, attributed to a shadowy group known as Meibion Glyndwr. Plaid Cymru's Elfyn Llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved, with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote. Ex-Welsh Office Minister Lord Roberts of Conwy denied security services were involved. In March this year, North Wales Police reopened the case, saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield DNA evidence.

Meibion Glyndwr - which means ""sons of Glyndwr"" - began burning property in December 1979 in protest at homes in rural Wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from England. The group was linked to most of the 220 or so fire-bombing incidents stretching from the Llyn Peninsula to Pembrokeshire. The campaign continued until the early 1990s. Police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist. Although one man, Sion Aubrey Roberts, was convicted in 1993 of sending letter bombs in the post, the arson cases remain unsolved.

As a solicitor, Elfyn Llwyd represented Welsh singer Bryn F&#244;n when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign. F&#244;n was released without charge . But now, as MP for Merionnydd Nant Conwy and Plaid Cymru's Parliamentary Leader, Mr Llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not Meibion Glyndwr. He believes that elements of the British security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit Plaid Cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections. The claim is made in an interview for BBC Wales' Maniffesto programme to be shown on S4C on Sunday.

Mr Llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others, suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the role that they took wasn't the appropriate one, i.e. like an

agent provocateur

and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible."" The programme also heard from Lord Roberts of Conwy, who was a Welsh Office minister at the time. He denied that the security services played any improper role. Mr Llwyd's theory has also been questioned by Plaid Cymru's former President, Dafydd Wigley. He accepted that the fires damaged Plaid Cymru's public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the IRA and animal rights activists.


 - Maniffesto can be seen on S4C on Sunday, 12 December, at 1200 GMT.

"Hatfield executives go on trial

Engineering firm Balfour Beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the Hatfield rail crash in 2000.

Four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed. Balfour Beatty's railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Balfour Beatty managers Anthony Walker and Nicholas Jeffries, and Railtrack managers Alistair Cook, Sean Fugill and Keith Lea all face individual charges. All five men, along with four others, are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. It is expected the trial could last as long as a year. The accident, on 17 October 2000, happened when the London to Leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. The accident on the East Coast Main Line sparked major disruption. The overall responsibility for the line was Railtrack's - the company that has now become Network Rail. Those who died in the accident were Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds; Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottingham; and Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand.

"Final hunts held as ban looms

Hunts in England and Wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later.

Thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets, many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a Thursday. The ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 GMT on Friday. The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.

But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. Others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.

Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law. Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: ""We've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do. ""But if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, that's against the law and we're confident they'll be brought to justice."" At the headquarters of Quorn hunt in Leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. BBC correspondent Sarah Mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.

She said many people did not share the Countryside Alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue. Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News people's lives ""revolved around hunting"". He described the ban as ""ridiculous"" and ""badly thought out"" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.

At the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid. But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.

The alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on Saturday. The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. A spokesman said: ""Basically, it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well."" The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. He said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.

"Falconer rebuts 'charade' claims

Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said.

Ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill amid chaotic scenes in the Commons on Tuesday. Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear.

The bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. Ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. Critics fear it could allow ""killing by omission"" through withdrawing treatment, including food and fluids.

Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. But changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland. ""It is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen,"" he said.

On Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs. The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. But that only came after MPs bombarded Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. Eventually, he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes, prompting claims of a shambles. The deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.

Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords. He told BBC News: ""We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life. ""The motive has got to be to end suffering."" He denied the concessions were a ""political manoeuvre"" forced by panic about the rebellion. It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a ""sensible solution"", he said. ""I don't think it is something to be embarrassed about. These issues are not easy to deal with,"" he went on. BBC political editor Andrew Marr said Mr Lammy was ""waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast"" after his performance. But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an ""excellent job"". Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, one of the chief critics of the plans, condemned the debate as a ""charade"" and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.

"School sport 'is back', says PM

Tony Blair has promised that ""sport is back"" as a priority for schools.

The prime minister launched a £500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. ""It's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,"" Mr Blair said. But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.

The latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options. Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London. He said: ""You've got to bring back school sport. It's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. It's still very, very important.""

Earlier, Education Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed ""a coherent framework"" and ""dedicated funding"". These were training for PE teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. He added the government had originally pledged ""for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education"" a week. The proportion was currently at 62%, and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. The money for the initiative will come from a new £500m fund.

The £500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. Shadow spokesman for sport Hugh Robertson said: ""I suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer."" He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an ""anti-competitive sport agenda"" had been pursued in recent years. Martin Ward, of the Secondary Heads Association, said members did not like ""ring-fenced funds"" and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.

"Anti-terror plan faces first test

Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.

Tories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against the plans. Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens. The government is expected to win Wednesday's vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords.

The Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday. It proposes ""control orders"", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.

The two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. ""Those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Mr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. The foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at London's Belmarsh prison. They are held under laws which the Law Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March.

The new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords. But the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.

In a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are ""excessive"". It argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan ""wrongly infringes the right to liberty"" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. Mr Davis told Today: ""It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned.""

He questioned why there was ""such a rush"" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""We believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians."" Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be ""rash and negligent"" to ignore their advice. Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued.

"Former NI minister Scott dies

Former Northern Ireland minister Sir Nicholas Scott has died at a London hospice, his family has announced.

The former Conservative MP for Kensington and Chelsea, died after a long illness diagnosed as Alzheimer's. The 71-year-old served in Northern Ireland from 1981 to 1987 during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. As a Northern Ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass IRA escape from the Maze in 1983.

In education, he encountered criticism over school closures and the future of the Catholic training colleges. He also merged the New University of Ulster and the Ulster Polytechnic to create the University of Ulster. Sir Nicholas was a strong defender of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was held in esteem in Dublin government and SDLP circles. But he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him ""Minister of Discord"". After leaving Northern Ireland in a reshuffle, he became a UK disability minister. Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996. His deselection followed a series of scandals including being found slumped in the street by police during the Tory Party conference in Bournemouth and taken back to his hotel.

Sir Nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol. After his sacking, he bitterly said that despite the support of Cabinet ministers and Tory backbenchers, the Eurosceptics in his constituency were ""absolutely determined to get rid of me"". His colourful career also included a very public disagreement with daughter Victoria over civil rights for the disabled. Sir Nicholas admitted he misled MPs when he denied his department had been involved in wrecking tactics designed to kill the Disability Bill in 1994. Victoria, a lobbyist for disabled rights, denounced her father's actions and heaped insult on injury when she joined the calls for him to resign. He joined the backbenches two months later.

"Blair rejects Iraq advice calls

Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.

The prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the Attorney General. Earlier, Conservative MP Michael Mates joined calls for a probe into claims Lord Goldsmith's statement to Parliament was drawn up at Number 10. Mr Blair said the statement was a ""fair summary"" of Lord Goldsmith's opinion.

""That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say. He has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue, saying it had been dealt with ""literally scores of times and the position has not changed"". Lord Goldsmith has denied being ""leaned on"" and says the words written were his.

The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. Mr Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence, told the BBC on Friday: ""That, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule."" He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charles's marriage plans. The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said.

Mr Mates added: ""We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers' advice to the government has been published. ""And this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister."" This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: ""Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it."" In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.

But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. Mr Sands' book suggests it was actually written by Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. She told the BBC the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code.

""My view is we need the House of Lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened,"" she said. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General. On Thursday, Lord Goldsmith said his statement had not been ""written by or at Number 10"". ""In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions,"" he said.

"Police probe BNP mosque leaflet

Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.

Anti-racism campaigners in Swansea have handed copies to South Wales Police. Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church. The building on George Street has been derelict since the 1980s.

Taha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public. ""I'm quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the BNP in Swansea,"" he said.

""The BNP has tried in the past to get into Swansea and this is another example of them trying again. ""I am in no doubt that the BNP are not needed and not wanted here."" A South Wales Police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. According to the BNP's website, they have been posted to homes in the Castle ward. The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet. The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion, but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. Swansea Unite Against Fascism (UAF) is meeting this week to plan a campaign. Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people. It is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.

Andy Richards, of Swansea UAF, said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the BNP.

""The people of Swansea will not put up with this."" Swansea's Muslim community bought the former church, just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helen's Road, in the late 1990s. Mr Idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building. ""It is a landmark building in Swansea and would otherwise just crumble,"" he said. ""It is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner. ""It will be a Muslim community centre. It's a holistic place used for education, weddings, deaths and births."" He said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions Muslims had to travel to Llanelli for cultural events.

"Blair says mayor should apologise

Tony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his ""Nazi"" comment to a Jewish reporter.

Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is ""standing by"" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a ""concentration camp guard"". Mr Blair told Five's Wright Stuff show: ""Let's just apologise and move on."" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.

Mr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.

""A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,"" he said. ""Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing."" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. ""It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,"" he said. ""I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that's a matter of great regret.""

The row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a ""German war criminal"".

Mr Finegold replies: ""No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that."" The mayor then says: ""Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?"" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. ""If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,"" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.

"Jowell confirms casino climbdown

Tessa Jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the UK to 24, in a move branded a ""humiliating retreat"" by the Tories.

It puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos, originally outlined in the government's Gambling Bill. Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large. The Culture Secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.

But Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a ""shambles"". ""This announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government. ""Instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill, to liberalise the rules governing gambling, the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present."" Shares in British casino operators London Clubs International, Rank Group and Stanley Leisure, who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos, fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement. Ms Jowell's deputy, Richard Caborn, said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue, and responded to the concerns raised. ""Limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling,"" he said. ""We also believe it's right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos.""

He added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas. Church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos. Salvation Army spokesman Jonathan Lomax said: ""The proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period, which we think should last at least five years, will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling."" But British British Casino Association Chairman Penny Cobham said her members were ""outraged"" by the decision, which followed a campaign in the Daily Mail newspaper. ""There was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos. Talk of a casino on every High Street was just a scaring tactic.""

"Security papers 'found in street'

An inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the Pakistani president's visit to London were found by a member of the public.

The files are believed to contain detailed security arrangements for Gen Pervez Musharraf's visit this week, including police codes. Scotland Yard said the policing operation had been reviewed. A spokesman said President Musharraf's safety had not been compromised, as the papers had been handed in promptly. ""We cannot discuss who was responsible for the documents, only that they contained the policing arrangements for the official visit,"" said the spokesman.

The papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in Mayfair and given to the Mirror newspaper. The police spokesman said the newspaper handed the report over on Monday. The force's Directorate of Professional Standards is investigating the circumstances surrounding the loss of the documents, he said. Gen Musharraf held talks with Tony Blair on Monday. He arrived in Britain on Sunday night after flying from the United States, where he met President George W Bush. He is due to visit the Pakistani community in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon.

"Blair congratulates Bush on win

Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president.

Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was ""fractured, divided and uncertain"", Mr Blair said. It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.

But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by ""military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values"" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most ""pressing political challenge"" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to ""build anew their alliance"".

""All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so."" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election ""a true celebration of American democracy"". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his ""warmest congratulations"", saying: ""We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom."" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.

Mr Bush's first task was to ""rebuild a sense of domestic purpose"" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: ""Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism."" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an ""umbilical cord"" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.

""Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. ""Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come."" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.

Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.

"Howard 'truanted to play snooker'

Conservative leader Michael Howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.

Mr Howard said his time at Jack's Snooker Hall in Llanelli in the 1950s had not done him ""any lasting damage"". But he told the Times Educational Supplement that truancy was ""very bad"" and said ""firm action"" was needed. Mr Howard also called for a return to O-levels and more classroom discipline.

Mr Howard eventually left Llanelli Grammar School - and the snooker hall - to go to Cambridge University. He said: ""I don't think it's done me any lasting damage. Nor has it made me a snooker world champion. ""There might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.

""I'm just being honest. I think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it."" Another player who has failed to win snooker's world championship - Jimmy ""the Whirlwind "" White - has previously admitted missing lessons, instead spending his days in smoky halls. ""Tony Meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there,"" Mr White said, ""We loved the game and the atmosphere. ""School went out of the window. I went for a while and then started taking time off."" Mr Howard's fellow Welshman Ray Reardon - known by his fellow professionals as ""Dracula"" - won the snooker world championship six times, having left school at 14 to work as a miner. And Terry Griffiths, like Mr Howard from Llanelli, won the tournament in 1979. It is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at Jack's.

But Ms Short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the UN. She said only the UN had the ""moral authority"" to lead the relief work. Ms Short resigned as international development secretary over the Iraq war. ""I think this initiative from America to set up four countries claiming to co-ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the UN when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up,"" she said. ""Only really the UN can do that job,"" she told BBC Radio Four's PM programme. ""It is the only body that has the moral authority. But it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers."" Ms Short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters. The US was ""very bad at coordinating with anyone"" and India had its own problems, Ms Short said. ""I don't know what that is about but it sounds very much, I am afraid, like the US trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the UN system,"" she added.

"Guantanamo four free in weeks

All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.

Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led ""war on terror"". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after ""intensive and complex discussions"" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.

But he added: ""Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity."" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still ""serious questions"" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a ""legal no-man's land"". ""Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.""

Azmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: ""If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there."" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: ""They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. ""They didn't do that. They colluded with it."" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: ""People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. ""I don't see any difference in this case."" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a ""major human-rights scandal"" and an ""icon of lawlessness"". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as ""long overdue"". Civil rights group Liberty said it was ""delighted"" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.

Director Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to ""practise what it preaches"" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.

"Tories attack EU asylum moves

David Blunkett has been accused of using the ""politics of confusion"" to disguise new EU immigration measures.

Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain. The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.

He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK. ""If we don't like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people,"" he said. The home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his Tory opposite number Mr Davis. ""The government is employing the politics of confusion - I think, deliberately,"" argued Mr Davis. ""By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto."" On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of British borders. He said an enlarged 25-member EU needs a streamlined decision making process. Mr Davis said once Britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant.

He accused the government of being ""pathetic"" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of ""surrendering"" on the issue. And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over. Mr Blair told his monthly news conference Britain had the ""best of both worlds"" and would keep the veto. ""There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls,"" he said. ""With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe."" Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.

The 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting (QMV) system. Under this scheme larger states such as Britain are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states. Britain is expected to retain an ""opt-in"" right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a European asylum solution. ""If we don't work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours,"" said Mr Oaten. ""The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it's right that we don't do this in isolation.""

"Cherie accused of attacking Bush

Cherie Blair has been accused of criticising George W Bush's policies in a private address she gave during a United States lecture tour.

The prime minister's wife is said to have praised the Supreme Court for overruling the White House on the legal rights of Guantanamo Bay detainees. The Tories said she broke a convention that British political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad. But Downing Street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer. It said she was not expressing political opinions. Mrs Blair's remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in Massachusetts. She said the decision by the US Supreme Court to give legal protection to two Britons held at Guantanamo Bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law. She also described the US legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by Mr Bush relating to sodomy in Texas.

BBC news correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said Mrs Blair was likely to face further calls for restraint, since the US election is imminent. ""There have been some objections from people reasonably close to the Bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election,"" he said. ""Conservatives here too have made their feelings clear. ""Cherie Booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career. She has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts. ""It's not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing.""

"Tsunami 'won't divert Africa aid'

UK aid to help the victims of the Asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from Africa, Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised.

Mr Blair told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not ""invade"" the money Britain wanted to spend on Africa. Questioned about the disaster, he said his faith in God had not been shaken. He added he would give new figures on the number of tsunami-related British deaths to the Commons on Monday. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Friday that about 440 Britons were either dead or missing in the disaster.

Mr Blair told Sunday's programme: ""Since Jack Straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they haven't moved a great deal, which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers. But we just can't be sure. ""It is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures, all countries are struggling with this.""

He said the £50 million originally allocated from the Department for International Development was now ""well on the way"" to being spent. But the exact allocation could not be clarified until the World Bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected. Within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the long-term costs of reconstruction, he added. But he pledged that Africa - which sees a ""preventable"" tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict, disease and poverty - would not be neglected. As Britain takes up its presidency of the G8 group of leading nations, Mr Blair said ministers had a big agenda for Africa. ""For the first time we have a plan that won't just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within African countries and conflict resolution,"" he said. ""A lot of the problems in Africa come from conflict, that again are preventable, but only with the right systems in place.""

"Mandelson warning to BBC

The BBC should steer away from ""demonising"" ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has said.

The European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell's campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street ""sexed up"" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.

The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard's past.

Mr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. ""What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. ""In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. ""I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. ""I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before.""

Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbell's return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of ""abusive politics"". ""The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,"" he said on Sunday. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. ""This feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might,"" she said.

"Blair 'pressing US on climate'

Tony Blair is pressing the US to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Downing Street has indicated.

Officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator John McCain recently visited Mr Blair. Climate change was an issue the prime minister ""wanted to progress"" during the UK's presidency of the G8 and EU in 2005, said a spokesman. But he played down reports Mr Blair was considering a new US-friendly treaty.

According to the Times, the UK leader wants to end US isolation with a ""Kyoto-lite"" agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. He is said to have discussed the idea with Mr McCain during his time at Number 10. The prime minister is said to believe the United States' refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol on emissions is undermining other countries' resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. So far the US has refused to sign up to the Kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. President Bush's advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.

Europe, which disputes the claim, has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the United States and developing countries. Mr Blair's reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions, says the Times. But there is still apparently ""little prospect"" of America agreeing to cut emissions, which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. Mr Blair was left blushing on Wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.

"Police chief backs drinking move

A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.

However, Norfolk police chief Andy Hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed. ""I don't subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it,"" he said. His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government's plans be put on hold. Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February. ""I feel that is a premature position to be taking,"" he said. Among those who have criticised the plans are the UK's top policeman Sir John Stevens.

The Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking ""epidemic"". However, Mr Hayman said: ""It would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, 'I'm very sorry'. He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation. ""My view is that I have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen, "" he said. However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking. But he is confident problems in the early days can be ""ironed out"". He believed the majority of people favoured this law change and ""we have to accept that lifestyles are changing"". But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account.

Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a ""tiny minority"" of violent binge drinkers. A six-month transitional period starts on 7 February during which time venues can apply for extended licences. The Conservatives have called for 24-hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved. On Monday, the Lib Dems also called for a delay. Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours."" Chief constable Mr Hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems. ""If you come to Norwich on a Friday or Saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed. ""However, I want industry to succeed in Norwich and I want Norwich to be the recognised nightspot of East Anglia. ""There is no way I want to say we cannot manage it or police it. We can.""

"Game warnings 'must be clearer'

Violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing, the trade and industry secretary has said.

Patricia Hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18-rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on Sunday. She is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include ""high levels of violence"". Parents are expected to spend millions on video games as Christmas presents.

Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. His mother, Giselle, said her son's killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game. Police investigating the Stefan's murder dismissed its influence and Manhunt was not part of its legal case. Ahead of Sunday's meeting in London, Ms Hewitt said she was proud of the UK's ""vibrant games industry"" but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults. Roger Bennett, head of gaming industry body ELSPA, said banning violent games would be wrong. He said: ""We don't want to go down that route. We have seen that the government is supportive of the industry."" The government is holding a further meeting on Friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the British Board of Film Classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer. Ms Hewitt said: ""Adults should be treated as adults and children as children. It is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors.

""Equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children. ""Video games are different to films or videos, and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do. ""We need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement."" Her call was backed by Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Tessa Jowell who said: ""You wouldn't let your child watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You wouldn't let them go to a strip club. ""So you shouldn't let them play an 18-rated game. It's the same principle - adults can make their own informed choices, but children can't always and need to be protected."" Anyone convicted of selling an 18-rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to £5,000. Rockstar Games, the makers of Manhunt, has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults.

"Mallon wades into NE vote battle

Middlesbrough mayor Ray Mallon has been drafted in to boost the Yes campaign as the North East assembly referendum enters its final week.

The former police chief, dubbed Robocop for his zero tolerance style, clashed on Thursday with Sunderland No campaigner Neil Herron. Mr Mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. But Mr Herron said North East people did not want or need an assembly.

The pair met on the platform at Sunderland station as Mr Mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. But Mr Herron - who gained fame as one of Sunderland's ""metric martyrs"" and is running his own No campaign alongside the official North East Says No campaign - said he was not convinced by Mr Mallon's arguments. ""The reality is that it is not going to deliver,"" he said. ""Labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. If you can't sell a deal in that time, it is a bad deal."" On Wednesday, Mr Mallon provoked fury by branding the official No Campaign ""two-bit Tories"" in a confrontation outside its Durham headquarters. ""The campaign is being run by two-bit Conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the North East; they are interested in hitting the Labour party over the head,"" he said. Mr Mallon is a late recruit to the Yes campaign after rejecting overtures from No campaigners including, he claims, Tory leader Michael Howard.

Most local observers believe the contest is too close to call, although little recent polling has been carried out. Yes campaign chairman John Tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. He added: ""The government exerts a lot of political power in the North East. The accountability should be in the North East as well."" He also defended the decision to attack the official No campaign's alleged political allegiances. ""We felt we had to show what people were behind the No campaign - London Tory spin doctors."" Graham Robb, spokesman for North East Says No, said the Yes campaign's decision to get personal dragged the campaign ""into the gutter"" and showed they were ""rattled"". And he hit back at Mr Mallon's claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region. ""It can push paper around but it can not get people moving,"" he said. Some 487,939 people had returned their ballot papers by Wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. The deadline for voting is next Thursday, 4 November.

"Howard rejects BNP's claim

Tory leader Michael Howard has dismissed claims that his immigration policy was ""moving onto the turf"" of the British National Party (BNP).

BNP leader Nick Griffin told the Independent he expected some BNP voters to switch to the Tories over the issue. But Mr Howard said he rejected the idea that the Tories and BNP appealed to the same voting instincts. Asked if he would welcome BNP voters he told the BBC: ""I don't want anybody to vote for these extremist parties"". He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If you want good community relations in this country...then you have to have firm, fair immigration controls.""

The Tories have promised an upper limit on the number of people allowed into Britain with the slogan: ""It's not racist to impose limits on immigration"". All parties are stepping up campaiging in the run-up to the general election, widely expected to be called for 5 May. Labour has unveiled its own ""points system"" for ensuring migrants who want to work in the UK have skills that are required, but have rejected immigration quotas. The Liberal Democrats have warned both parties against ""pandering to prejudice"".

Mr Griffin told the Independent the Tories' plans were ""a definite move onto our turf"". He said: ""I quite freely accept that on a nationwide basis, the Tories will con enough people to make a significant hole in our vote."" Asked whether he was comfortable with the perception that the Conservatives and the BNP appeal to the same voting instincts, Mr Howard told the BBC: ""I reject that entirely"". He said he found BNP's policies ""abhorrent"" but he said the UK had to take a different approach to immigration, which he said was out of control. ""The government doesn't want to limit it in any way, we do, there's a legitimate difference between us there which we can discuss in a calm, rational and reasonable way,"" he said. He again rejected newspaper speculation that his own father entered Britain illegally.

"Tories opposing 24-hour drinking

The Tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control, despite backing a law change last year.

Spokesman David Davis said ministers had failed to make his party aware of concern among senior police that plans would cause more anti-social behaviour. Notts police chief Steve Green said innocent people would suffer. But Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said a delay would be ""disastrous"" and she accused the Tories of opportunism. The government would go ahead with the changes which would give police more power to tackle excessive drinking, she added. Earlier chief constable Green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises. ""If you look at the Market Square in Nottingham, if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of?"" he asked on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.

He warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night. Earlier this year the Royal College of Physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an ""epidemic"" of binge drinking. Minister Richard Caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises. It is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once. Earlier Tony Blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers.

""My view of this is very clear: we should have the same flexibility that other countries have and then we should come down really hard on those who abuse that freedom and don't show the responsibility,"" he told MPs. ""The law-abiding majority who want the ability, after going to the cinema or theatre say, to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced, we shouldn't have to have restrictions that no other city in Europe has, just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol, who go out and fight and cause disturbances. ""To take away that ability for all the population - even the vast majority who are law abiding - is not, in my view, sensible."" This week a judge claimed easy access to drink was breeding ""urban savages"" and turning town centres into no go areas. Judge Charles Harris QC made his remarks as he sentenced three men for assaults carried out while drunk and high on drugs after a night out.

"New foot and mouth action urged

A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's ""lackadaisical"" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.

Public accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was ""dragging its heels"".

That comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been ""dreadfully slow"" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.

The outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. ""Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,"" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.

Ministers had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between ""two and three times"" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, ""but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations"".

Mr Leigh said being ""better prepared"" would also help avoid the need for ""mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak"". A Defra spokesman said: ""We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. ""However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.""

"Correction agency plans dropped

Plans to create a single correctional agency for Scotland have been scrapped.

The Scottish Executive will not now merge the Scottish Prison Service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. The National Correctional Agency would have provided a 'one-stop' justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. Instead, Scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. The plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.

Scotland's reoffending rate is high, with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. This is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. Ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments, which provide community sentences, might have provided an answer. However, following a consultation on the idea, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson has decided to drop the plans. Instead, Ms Jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.

She will announce the move in her Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to ""break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community"". The new measures will place a new statutory duty on the SPS to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. A national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise Ms Jamieson on the SPS's role and performance in reducing reoffending. The minister said: ""Better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there. ""Communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better. ""It costs the taxpayer £35,000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing. ""Taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison. ""Therefore, as we continue to invest in the service, it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves, to ministers and to parliament.""

"Tutu's Guantanamo release call

Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo Bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the UK.

His comments follow news that all four Britons held by the US in the Cuban camp will be freed within weeks. The South African archbishop said detentions without trial were ""unacceptable"" and ""distressing"". Twelve foreign nationals are being held indefinitely without trial in the UK under anti-terror laws. Referring to the detentions in Cuba, Archbishop Tutu told BBC News: ""It is utterly unacceptable. ""The rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don't use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty.""

Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US at Guantanamo Bay for almost three years. On Tuesday Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons that the US had agreed to release the four after ""intensive and complex discussions"" over security. The Britons were detained as part of the US-led ""war on terror"". The archbishop added: ""Whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released, what is happening to those left behind? ""We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.

""Now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to Britain and the United States. It is so, so deeply distressing."" Following Mr Straw's announcement, lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. Foreign nationals detained in the UK are being held at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. In December the House of Lords, the UK's highest court, ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws. But the men are still behind bars.

Archbishop Tutu criticised the measures, saying: ""I am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening, even in Britain."" Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, has called on the government to ""practise what it preaches"" and either free or charge the detained men. But the Home Office defended the measures. A spokesman said: ""These individuals cannot currently be prosecuted because some evidence, such as that provided by third parties, cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk. ""It is also currently the case that intelligence gained from covert intercepts cannot be used in a court of law.""

"Blair's hope for Blunkett return

The events leading to David Blunkett's resignation must not ""swept under the carpet"", the Tories have warned.

On Wednesday Tony Blair said he hoped the former home secretary would serve again in government in the future. Mr Blunkett quit in December after a probe linked him to the visa application of his ex-lover's nanny. Mr Blair said he left ""without a stain on his character"" but Tory Dominic Grieve branded the way Mr Blunkett's office operated as ""scandalous"". Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I know David very well and I believe him to be a man of real integrity and real ability and I was very sad for him as to what happened.""

He said Mr Blunkett still had an immense amount to offer the country but he was not making any ""guarantees or definitive statements"" about future jobs. But shadow attorney general Mr Grieve said: ""While I don't rule out the possibility that Mr Blunkett may return as a minister, I don't think it's something that can simply be brushed under the carpet."" Senior Labour backbencher Martin O'Neill, who chairs the Commons trade committee, said he believed the prime minister would want one of his ""praetorian guard"" - a reference to the elite body guard of Roman emperors - back alongside him. But colleague Ian Gibson, who chairs the science and technology committee, said there was a ""question mark"" as to whether Mr Blunkett could serve at cabinet level again.

"February poll claim 'speculation'

Reports that Tony Blair is planning a snap general election for February 2005 have been described as ""idle speculation"" by Downing Street.

A spokesman said he had ""no idea"" where the reports in the Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph had come from. The papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a ""Baghdad bounce"" following successful Iraq elections in January. A British general election was last held in February in 1974. In that election, Edward Heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the Liberals. Harold Wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election

The latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a February poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over Conservative leader Michael Howard. But that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to ""cut and run"" after less then four years of a parliamentary term. The papers report that Alan Milburn, Labour's head of elections strategy, has played a key role in the plan for a February election, which would include a New Year advertising blitz. New Labour's campaign, both newspapers said, would be centred around the slogan ""Britain is Working"". A Labour Party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for Mr Blair, but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in February. Most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 May. The last election was in June 2001.

"Gurkhas to help tsunami victims

Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.

The deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.

However a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: ""Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. ""This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.""

Indonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. ""We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,"" he said. ""We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well."" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.

"Abbas 'will not tolerate' attacks

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last Friday's suicide bombing in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.

In an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, Mr Abbas said such attacks were against Palestinian interests. The Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting ""a 100% effort"" to end the violence, Mr Abbas added. The attack, which killed five, was the first of its kind since he took office. Mr Abbas confirmed Israel shared information with the PA in the hunt for the organisers of the attack. The Israeli government refuses to accept Syria's denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing. Israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on Monday, explaining Syria's alleged involvement. British foreign minister Jack Straw said there had been a ""continuing stream"" of information suggesting Palestinian militant groups were operating from within Syria.

In an email interview in the British newspaper the Independent, Mr Abbas said: ""We believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with Israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy."" He added: ""We have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we, the Israelis, or the world allow it to slip away."" Tuesday's meeting on Palestinian reform is being hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Also due to attend are US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, World Bank officials and foreign ministers from 23 European and Arab countries. The conference was a ""vital step"" in renewing the peace process, Mr Straw said. ""It's a high-level attendance, which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events,"" he added. A spokesman for Mr Blair said the Prime Minister expected the conference to discuss ""a comprehensive, co-ordinated and, above all, practical work plan for both the Palestinian Authority and the international community"". Israel will not attend, but is said to be closely watching the outcome.

"Thousands join strike in Wales

Thousands of civil servants were on strike across Wales on Friday in protest at planned job cuts.

A range of services in Wales were affected as civil servants in Wales joined the UK-wide strike. The strike, called by the Public and Commercial Services Union, was the biggest by civil servants in a decade. The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales. The worst-affected area in Wales will be the Department of Work and Pensions where 2,000 jobs are threatened. Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham. Gordon Brown issued a defiant statement about the strike, saying the action would not affect the government's ""determination"" to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare, education, transport and the fight against crime. ""Our decisions mean more police, more teachers, more doctors and more nurses,"" he said. ""We will provide help with information, relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector, but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment."" The UK-wide action hit Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices and driving test centres. The strike also affected the Welsh assembly building in Cardiff Bay, where only pass-holders were allowed in.

Pickets were in place across Wales, with protests around the country. PCS Union spokesman Jeff Evans said: ""In Wales the civil service is major employer, there are more civil servants employed in Wales proportionately than in any other part of the country. ""Our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country. ""Parts of Objective One areas and Welsh-speaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts."" The chancellor has said that the cuts will allow funding for more teachers and police. Piers Freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at Companies House, in Cardiff. He said: ""The majority of people have decided not to come in because of the threat to their jobs. ""I joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension, as we thought, and pay, and it's those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs. ""People like pensioners need a face-to-face service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose."" PCSU deputy general secretary Hugh Lanning, who was on the same picket line, said: ""We're asking for them to negotiate not just to make announcements. ""There's a sensible way to do things and at the moment they're not even talking about how to go about it sensibly."" ""The ballot was for one day's action. No further action is anticipated without a further ballot of staff."" The Welsh Assembly Government said: ""This is a strike about national civil service issues. It is not about specific issues local to Wales or the assembly.

"Top judge clashes with ministers

The UK's top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen.

Lord Woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence. But he told MPs the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, was insisting he should have the final say in such cases. Lord Hutton's inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries.

The government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against Lord Woolf's wishes. Lord Woolf, who is Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, was giving evidence to the Commons public administration select committee's inquiry into public inquiries. He said he had not been involved in the choice of Lord Hutton, who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction. But he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so, which judge it should be. In written evidence to the committee, Lord Woolf said: ""I have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ... I intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation.""

Judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue, such as the intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he said. He argued: ""The subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved. ""In addition, the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed, the judiciary, as a result of the appointment, may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government."" He told the MPs: ""Anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me.""

Lord Woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns. But that situation could change with new legal reforms. The issue had been ""overlooked"" when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions. ""What I am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen,"" he said.

Lord Woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle. A Department for Constitutional Affairs spokeswoman said Lord Woolf and Lord Falconer agreed about what happened in practice. ""Their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence - a very narrow dispute, in Lord Woolf's words,"" she said. ""As Lord Woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice. ""Judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs."" Parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.

"Tory expert denies defeatism

The Conservatives' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned Michael Howard the party could not win the next general election.

The Times on Monday said Australian Lynton Crosby told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the Tories' Commons presence by 25 to 30 seats. But Mr Crosby said in a statement: ""I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view."" Mr Howard later added there was not ""one iota"" of truth in the report. The strategist helped Australia's PM, John Howard, win four elections. Mr Howard appointed Mr Crosby as his elections chief last October. Mr Crosby's statement said: ""The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week."" It added: ""The Labour Party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people.""

"Lib Dems target the student vote

Students can decide the fate of MPs in some seats at the next election, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has claimed.

The party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. The figures assume all students will vote in their university town. In fact, some may vote where the parents live. The Lib Dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. But the Tories would also end fees and Labour says both would cap people's ambitions.

The Lib Dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the Lib Dems from second place to beat Labour, and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the Tories. Launching his campaign to win students' votes at the London School of Economics, Mr Kennedy urged students to ""make their mark"". He underlined Lib Dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to £2,000. He said: ""Top-up fees put students off university, especially those from a poorer background. ""And is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks?"" Mr Kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the Iraq war, which his party opposed, as a defining issue.

Labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3,000. Ahead of Mr Kennedy's launch, a Labour spokesperson said: ""Like the Tories, the Liberal Democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration, closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions. ""They are committed to abandoning Labour's targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under Lib Dem plans students would even have to study near home."" The Conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.

They say the Lib Dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the ""goodwill"" of the chancellor.

Shadow education secretary Tim Collins is on Thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for 14 to 16-year-olds to tackle what he says are ""crippling skills shortages"". The Lib Dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university, not in their home towns. Although the expected 5 May election would be during term time, students can vote by post. The Electoral Commission and National Union of Students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. Some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. If the election is on 5 May, voters need to register by 11 March.


 - The seats where the Lib Dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: Bristol West, Cardiff Central, Leeds North West, Cambridge, Manchester Gorton, Sheffield Central, Oxford East, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central, Liverpool Riverside, Holborn and St Pancras, Oldham East and Saddleworth, Manchester Withington, Islington South and Finsbury, Birmingham Yardley, Surrey South West, Taunton, Orpington, Haltemprice and Howden, Eastbourne, Isle of Wight, Dorset West, Bournemouth East, Wells, Canterbury, Cities of London and Westminster, Bournemouth West, Westmorland and Lonsdale.

"Custody death rate 'shocks' MPs

Deaths in custody have reached ""shocking"" levels, a committee of MPs and peers has warned.

The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said. The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate ""amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group"".

Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had ""presented themselves"" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. It questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided.

Increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said. Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: ""Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.

""Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives."" ""These highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill-suited to meet even their basic needs. ""Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered. ""Until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and meet our duty of care to them.""

The committee also highlighted ""deeply worrying"" cases of children and young people taking their own lives. Between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres. It picked out the case of Joseph Scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in Stoke Heath Young Offender Institution in March 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. It revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16-year-old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times. Even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness, he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order. Nine days into his sentence, Joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet.

"New rules tackle 'sham weddings'

New rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.

From Tuesday, most non-EU citizens will need Home Office approval to marry. The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year. But immigrants' group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. When the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister Des Browne said: ""Our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse."" Under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the UK only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.

But from Tuesday all non-EU nationals, apart from citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Norway, intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office 'certificate of marriage approval'. To get a certificate, costing £135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the UK. Those without a settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will have no right to marry in the UK.

Once they have the necessary documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in England or Wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. They can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice. Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were ""not proportionate"" and ""discriminatory"".

""These rules means in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. ""We're currently taking a legal opinion on this. We'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court,"" Ms Beynon said. The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"". The committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the Human Rights Act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added.

Over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. In January 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in Leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. And last November Samuel Amoah, a Belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the UK, was jailed for three years. Several other cases are currently going through the courts. The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions. Registrars' spokesman, Mark Rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. ""They will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. Certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,"" Mr Rimmer said. Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. ""It may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the UK than it is to marry, for example, in Holland, Germany or France. ""I think it's a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,"" Mr Rimmer said.

"Ministers 'naive' over phone-taps

The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.

Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries. Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: ""[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. ""It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."" Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.

Under the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge. Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.

Some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. Human Rights group Liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal. He has opted for a system of ""control orders"" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. These orders will again involve a UK opt-out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights. While accepting that people ""have to be prepared"" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had ""qualms"" about the home secretary's new plans. ""We have to fight terrorism with all our means, but not so far as to change our way of life,"" he said.

"Schools to take part in mock poll

Record numbers of schools across the UK are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government.

Some 600 schools have already signed up for the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 run by the Hansard Society and aimed at boosting interest in politics. Pupils in the schools taking part will learn the skills of speech writers, canvassers and political candidates. Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said engaging young people's interest was ""essential"" to the future of democracy.

He added: said ""Young people who are engaged and motivated by the political process are essential to the future health of our democracy. ""The mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters. ""By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future."" The Hansard Society, the Electoral Commission and the Department for Education and Skills are running the programme. Pupils will stand as party candidates, speech writers and canvassers. Michael Raftery, project manager at the Hansard Society, said: ""The Y Vote Mock Elections for schools mirror the excitement and buzz of a real election, raising awareness of citizenship, and the benefits of active democracy."" The mock votes will take place around 5 May, widely expected to be the date of the general election. Information packs, including ballot papers and manifesto guides, with elections happening in early May were sent out to the 3,000 schools invited to take part.

"Blair dismisses quit claim report

Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.

""You don't do deals over jobs like this,"" the prime minister told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004. Mr Blair said the claims were ""reheated from six months ago"" and that he was concentrating on running the country. Mr Blair said: ""I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.

""What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country."" The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other.

It claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down. According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: ""Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down."" But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.

Mr Peston told BBC News: ""My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. ""What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. ""I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."" But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: ""When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. ""All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims."" He admitted to a ""sense of frustration"" about the allegations which he said had been made ""countless times"".

There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""Marshall Plan"" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a ""load of nonsense"". Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so.

Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of ""squabbling like schoolboys"". He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: ""This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better."" The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was ""getting in the way of good government"". ""Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election."" During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a ""big role"" at the general election.

"Jamieson issues warning to bigots

Scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches.

Cathy Jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the Scottish Executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised Celtic and Rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with Old Firm matches is a key objective. Ms Jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round Scottish Cup clash between the Glasgow clubs at Parkhead on Sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.

They plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs, church leaders, senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme, Ms Jamieson described Friday's meeting as ""very productive"" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. Ms Jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a ""trigger"" for tensions and violence. Clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters' groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem.

Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. She said: ""We can't get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence. ""That is the kind of thing we want to stop and that's the kind of thing supporters' groups are very clear they don't want to be part of either, and they will work with us to try and deal with that.""

Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: ""The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them. ""We have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top, who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches, to be able to stop them attending the games. ""That's the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games,"" she said. Praising Celtic and Rangers for their efforts, she said: ""I don't think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs. ""Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people.""

"Clarke plans migrant point scheme

Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.

He is proposing a points system similar to Australia's but would avoid the quota system planned by the Tories. Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but ""needed proper policing"". The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a ""clear choice"" on the issue. The Conservative Party Co-Chairman said the British electorate had a choice between a Labour government that had ""done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit"" on immigration and a Tory one that would impose quotas.

The home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to ""ensure we can know everybody who is in the country"". Speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost, he said ""economic migrants are of great value to this country"", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a ""burden on society"". He said: ""We will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.""

The home secretary, whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on Monday, also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. ""The issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,"" he said. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the Tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.""

Mr Howard has said Britain should take its fair share of the world's ""genuine refugees"". But he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, called on Mr Clarke to denounce the suggestion Britain's hospitality was being tested by immigration. ""Tell that to the 44,000 doctors in the NHS and the 70,000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means,"" he said. ""Ditto the teachers, from South Africa, Australia, Jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools."" The Refugee Council said Mr Howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.

"Clarke defends terror detentions

The home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.

House of Lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week. They said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for British suspects. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to Parliament early in the new year with proposals.

He insisted that he would not be rushed into judgement but would examine the law lords' findings in detail. ""My duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are."" Mr Clarke's comments came in response to an emergency question from Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath. Mr Heath said the judgement contained ""unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal"". He said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation's security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made ""no contingency plans for the present circumstances"".

""These detainees should be prosecuted and tried. Simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option."" Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as ""competently possible"" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice. ""If you do, we will give you every support."" The law lords' ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement on the same day, Mr Clarke said: ""I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year. ""In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.""

But the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week. Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law."" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US.

"Voters 'reject EU by two to one'

British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.

The Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.

Ballot papers in the poll will ask: ""Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?"" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.

The treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. ""If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,"" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a ""yes"" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question ""seems straightforward"". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as ""two separate issues"".

"Kennedy questions trust of Blair

Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a ""fundamental lack of trust"" of Tony Blair as prime minister.

He said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the Lib Dems ""what you see is what you get"". He made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on Channel Five in a session on The Wright Stuff programme. Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.

Mr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. ""1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,"" he said. ""We don't actually hear the argument any longer: 'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. ""You don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote."" But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people. ""There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,"" he said.

""What we've got to do as a party - what I've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get."" Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. Mr Blair has already spent a day with Five and Michael Howard is booked for a similar session.

"Terror detainees win Lords appeal

Detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK's highest court has ruled.

In a blow to the government's anti-terror measures, the House of Lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. Most of the men are being indefinitely held in Belmarsh prison, south London. The law lords said the measures were incompatible with European human rights laws. The men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. The ruling creates a major problem for Charles Clarke on his first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. The Liberal Democrats say Mr Clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor, David Blunkett. Belmarsh prison has been dubbed Britain's Guantanamo Bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws.

The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. However those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland.

On Thursday, senior law lord Lord Bingham said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"". Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. ""It deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford.""

He said the weakness for the government's case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for British suspects. Lord Hoffmann said: ""The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these."" But Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.

In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: ""I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Ben Emmerson QC, representing seven of the detainees, said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. He said they had been given no idea when, if ever, they would be released, had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. When the men were first held, they took their cases to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). The commission ruled on 30 July, 2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as British people could not be held in the same way. But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.

"Blair to face MPs amid feud talk

Tony Blair faces his first prime minister's questions of 2005 after a week of renewed speculation about his relationship with Gordon Brown.

Meanwhile, the chancellor is leaving Britain on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight poverty issues. But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. Labour MPs have warned against disunity and Tory leader Michael Howard may well take up the theme in the Commons. The Tories have already accused the prime minister and his chancellor of behaving like ""schoolboys squabbling in a playground"".

Michael Howard is likely to want to capitalise further on the spat when he goes head-to-head with the prime minister in the Commons. At a campaign poster launch on Tuesday, Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor.

Later this week the prime minister is due to set out the themes of his party's next election manifesto, which for the past two polls have been drawn up by the chancellor. Mr Brown, meanwhile, is visiting Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya to highlight the plight of many Africans hit by Aids, war and famine - issues which Mr Blair has also spoken out on. The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs.

On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: ""They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line."" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. In Mr Peston's book Mr Brown is alleged to have told the prime minister: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.""

"Tories unveil quango blitz plans

Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.

Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than £4.3bn. Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.

The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. Their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.

Announcing the plans, Mr Redwood said: ""Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. ""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" His party leader, Michael Howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. ""Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain,"" he said. ""In the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. They've seen their pensions knocked for six. ""They're being squeezed by extra taxes. The forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic Britain."" The government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. The Liberal Democrats have said they would cut the number of Whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.

"Clarke faces ID cards rebellion

Charles Clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on Monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial ID cards bill.

Up to 30 Labour MPs could oppose the scheme during a Commons debate. Mr Clarke, who took on the post on Thursday after David Blunkett quit, has rejected calls to ""pause"" on the bill. Tory leader Michael Howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards. The Liberal Democrats oppose the plans.

Mr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of ""liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears"" by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties. He writes that it is actually a ""profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society - which is the right to live free from fear crime and fear"". Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail. He is also expected to cut the £85 cost of the card and passport, for the elderly and those on lower incomes.

Mr Howard last week said his front bench team had reached a ""collective view"" to back ID cards after holding a ""good discussion"", but admitted it was ""not an easy issue"". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. But former shadow attorney general Bill Cash said there was still ""very deep"" disquiet about the plan among senior Tories. He told BBC Radio 4's Today the government was ""intensely authoritarian"" and was creating ""increasingly a Big Brother society"". Critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim.

Ministers say it would help the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime. But opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the Madrid rail bombing. On Sunday, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy repeated his call for a ""pause"" in considering the legislation.

He told BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme that Mr Clarke had a ""real opportunity"" on Monday following the departure of Mr Blunkett. ""If you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the Identity Cards Bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the New Year? ""That is the sensible way to go about it but I think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all."" The first cards would be issued in 2008 and, when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them. The new bill would also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents.

"Labour pig poster 'anti-Semitic'

The Labour Party has been accused of anti-Semitism over a poster depicting Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.

Prospective Tory candidate Andrew Mennear, whose Finchley constituency contains a large Jewish community, branded it ""tasteless"" and offensive. The poster shows the two men's faces superimposed on winged pigs and says ""the day the Tory sums add up"". Labour said the poster was ""not anti-Jewish, but anti-Tory"".

It is one of four designs e-mailed to Labour members, who were asked to vote for their favourite. Mr Mennear, who was sent the e-mail by a friend, said he had been ""shocked"" by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified. He said there was nothing more distasteful for a Jewish person than to be associated with a pig. ""I am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent, but these sort of things can cause great offence. It clearly wasn't thought through. ""It is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact, but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn.""

The campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as Holocaust Day, a ""difficult"" time for many Jewish people, Mr Mennear added. A Labour spokesman denied the campaign was anti-Semitic. ""As we said at the time the James report (the Tory backed inquiry into possible public spending savings) was published pigs will fly before the Tory's sums will add up. This poster is making a serious point,"" he said. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""While the Conservatives are concentrating on the issues that matter to people, such as lower taxes and controlled immigration, it is clear to see that the Labour Party is not. People will not be fooled.""

"Iraqis win death test case probe

The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.

The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights. And the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out. Their families will be appealing against the judgement.

The families' solicitor Phil Shiner described it as ""a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the UK"". Father-of-two Mr Mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in Basra in September 2003. He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.

Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction. But Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that UK jurisdiction could extend to a UK-run prison, but did not apply ""to the total territory of another state"". They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction. The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.

And it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred ""has been timely, open or effective"", the judges said. After the ruling Carla Ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation Redress, said: ""It is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. ""There must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. Only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible."" Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003. Both sides were granted permission to appeal.

Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: ""Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. ""I can't say anything further for obvious reasons. The MoD are considering whether to appeal."" But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : ""Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out. Because we don't want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it',"" he said. ""The Ministry of Defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.""

"Burglar defence guidelines issued

Householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting ""honestly and instinctively"", new guidelines say.

The law also protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon. The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use ""reasonable force"". The guidance, relating to England and Wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. Doing what you ""honestly and instinctively"" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.

And the law protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of ""excessive and gratuitous"" force. The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use ""grossly disproportionate"" force. Their demands have been backed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens. Tory frontbencher Patrick Mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member's bill in Parliament.

The government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: ""I believe in that old adage 'an Englishman's home is his castle'. That's exactly what should be the case and I believe the current law provides that."" An ""informal trawl"" of CPS records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted. They included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in Cheshire, before beating him up, throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.

A CPS spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. In one of Britain's highest profile cases, Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras, in 1999. The conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. Mr Martin was freed from prison in July 2003. The guidance published on Tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. In cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were ""determined"" they would be dealt with ""as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible"", it said.

"Woolf murder sentence rethink

Plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.

There was an outcry three months ago when the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf - published its proposals for England and Wales. It had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. But that has now been changed to one-sixth, with no reduction for those killers given a ""whole life tariff"". At the time Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.

But director of the Victims of Crime Trust, Norman Brennan, accused Lord Woolf of having an ""arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public"". The National Association of Probation Officers said the move would be ""political suicide"". In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be ""weighed carefully"" by a judge so they did not lead to ""an inappropriately short sentence"". Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.

In a statement issued on Wednesday Lord Woolf said: ""I have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the SGC has vastly improved the final guidelines. ""I am confident, as a result, that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending."" Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who sits on the SGC, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. ""What the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. ""It represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity,"" he said.

"Probe launched on Ken Nazi jibe

An investigation by the Standards Board is under way following allegations that Ken Livingstone has brought his office into disrepute.

The probe follows the London mayor's comments to a Jewish journalist comparing him to a concentration camp guard, after a party about a week ago. The local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others. It has the power to suspend or bar Labour's Mr Livingstone from office. A complaint was made to the body by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Commission for Racial Equality.

Speaking after the investigation was announced Bob Neill, leader of the London Assembly Conservatives, said: ""He has behaved in a manner unbecoming of his office and in so doing, has shown extraordinarily poor civic leadership. ""His administration is now in crisis."" On Sunday, Deputy Mayor Nicky Gavron told the BBC's Politics Show she believed the Mayor of London would say sorry on Tuesday for offending the wider Jewish community. The Prime Minister Tony Blair is among those who have called for an apology but so far the mayor has refused.

The mayor accused Oliver Finegold, of the Evening Standard newspaper, of ""doorstepping"" him at a ""predominately gay event"" held for MP Chris Smith. Ms Gavron said she thought Mr Livingstone's comments were ""inappropriate"" but she did not believe the mayor was anti-Semitic. She said: ""I work very closely with Ken so I can speak of what he's like in his guarded and unguarded moments and... he is in no way anti-Jewish, I wouldn't for a moment work with him if he were. ""On the other hand, I think his remarks were inappropriate and I believe it is important, and I believe he will, come to the point where he says, 'I regret that I have caused offence to the wider Jewish community'. ""I hope he will do it soon and it is mooted that he is going to make some sort of statement on Tuesday.""

"'Few ready' for information act

Thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the Freedom of Information Act, due to come into force next month, because of government failures, say MPs.

From next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from Whitehall departments to doctors' surgeries. But an all-party committee said it was ""not confident"" many would be ready. It blamed the Department for Constitutional Affairs for a ""lack of consistent leadership"".

The Act comes into effect in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, on 1 January while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.

But the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an ""unusually high turnover"" of staff within the department, which had ""seriously interfered"" with its work, said the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee. It said, despite four years of preparations, some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. The DCA had ""failed"" to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a ""lack of consistent leadership"", the MPs found. Committee chairman Alan Beith said: ""The DCA has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared. ""Our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the DCA, which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime, has been lacking."" A spokesman for the DCA said: ""The DCA has provided - and will continue to provide - strong, clear leadership. ""It has delivered a simple, liberal fees regime, guidance on the Act which has been widely praised, and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.""

"Blunkett unveils policing plans

People could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in England and Wales unveiled by David Blunkett.

The plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. The home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. Local people would also be able to ""trigger"" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. Local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. And police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous, would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources.

Mr Blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. The home secretary's powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after Mr Blunkett's battle with Humberside chief David Westwood over intelligence failures on Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

Opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. Tory spokesman David Davis said the proposals were ""little more than a taxpayer-funded PR exercise"" ahead of a general election predicted for next May.

Police forces were already ""buried"" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them,"" said Mr Davis. Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police. ""But these measures will only work if they're matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets.""

Before delivering a statement to MPs, Mr Blunkett was joined by Tony Blair at Welling School, in south east London, which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. Mr Blunkett said he wanted ""to go back to a time when I was very young, when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work"". The prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and ""not the minority who want to cause trouble"".

Mr Blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. He has also started to recruit 25,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. An extra £50m was promised on Tuesday so 2,000 new CSOs can be recruited now rather than next year. Within two years, every force will be expected to keep to a ""coppers' contract"" on what kind of service the public can expect. A Mori poll this summer suggested policing, unlike health and education, was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. There will also be ""specific exercises"" to encourage black and Asian people to join the police at senior ranks.

"Jack Cunningham to stand down

Veteran Labour MP and former Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election.

One of the few Blair-era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997. Mr Cunningham went on to become Tony Blair's ""cabinet enforcer"". He has represented the constituency now known as Copeland since 1970. Mr Blair said he was a ""huge figure"" in Labour and a ""valued, personal friend"".

During Labour's long period in opposition, Mr Cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs, the environment and as trade spokesman. As agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over BSE. He quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all-party committee on Lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches.

Ex-chatshow host Robert Kilroy-Silk has attacked UK policy on immigration saying Britain's open door approach is hitting low wage ""indigenous"" workers.

The Veritas leader said the only people to benefit from immigrants from places like Poland were employers, landlords, members of the 'metropolitan elite'. The MEP said his party would only admit foreigners who were required because they had specific skills to offer. And he argued asylum cost £2bn a year for 14,000 successful applicants.

Mr Kilroy-Silk said that worked out at £143,000 per successful asylum seeker. He said Veritas wanted to grant an amnesty for all those in Britain claiming asylum and who have children and deport everyone else. Britain should take its fair share of asylum seekers under the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, he argued. And Mr Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to spend an extra £500m a year to help provide for refugees abroad.

"Regiments' group in poll move

A regiments' campaign group is to target nine marginal Labour seats at the General Election.

Save the Scottish Regiments will also field a candidate against Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram in East Kilbride. The group, which is unhappy at defence merger plans, is endorsing opposition candidates in nine seats. The marginals are Aberdeen South, Dumfriesshire, Dundee East and West, South West Edinburgh, Ochil, Stirling, East Renfrewshire and Western Isles. The campaigners unveiled a huge poster featuring Black Watch soldiers fighting the war in Iraq before they announced their election plans.

Former Scots Guardsman Allan Hendry will challenge Mr Ingram. The group said it is well organised, with 350 volunteers, and will be announcing at least one other candidate later. It added that it can only be stopped from inflicting serious damage on Labour if the government reverses its plan to merge the six Scottish regiments.

Scotland's only Conservative MP Peter Duncan said the Save the Scottish Regiments had done a ""superb job"" in fighting against defence cuts. He added: ""Their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops, and have shown a steely determination to make Labour pay for their betrayal. ""I have been honoured to speak at their rallies throughout Scotland."" Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said it had received a ""big boost"" from the campaign's decision to endorse SNP candidates in four marginal seats.

""Labour's arrogance has been their undoing. In trying to get rid of Scotland's historic regiments, Labour MPs will end up being scrapped themselves,"" he said. However, Labour MP George Foulkes said the campaigners would not make any difference to the outcome of the election and would not win the argument. ""A serving soldier knows that what Labour is proposing is right,"" he said. As well as their election move, Save the Scottish Regiments will join other campaigners at a rally in London in the spring. Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announced last year that Scotland's regiments would be combined into a single unit. The move was part of overall Army reforms.

"Row over 'police' power for CSOs

The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.

The powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday. The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with ""potentially confrontational"" situations. But the government said the move would help police ""build safe communities"". Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as ""eyes and ears"" for the police.

""They should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is,"" she said. CSOs can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. The powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. Ms Berry said this ""dramatically changes"" their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. She said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.

But Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers ""just that little bit of edge"". She denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.

""The powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling,"" she said. The Home Office has produced its own report on CSOs which it describes as ""encouraging"". Ms Blears said the study shows CSOs are ""making a real difference"" in the fight against crime. But the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer.

Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.

""While the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone,"" he said. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the research is inconclusive. There are about 3,500 CSOs in England and Wales but the government intends to have 25,000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of £50m. They already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.

"Sport betting rules in spotlight

A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.

The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year. It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating. The all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting. They include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years. Lord Condon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two-year penalty was ""derisory"". ""You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports. ""Symbolically, a higher penalty, perhaps as the Bill passes through the two Houses, might be appropriate.""

The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up ""audit trails"" - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.

Lord Faulkner of Worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said: ""Whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption. ""It is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately."" The panel's aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating, assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right. As well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting, there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves. Betting exchanges allow punters to back (to win) but also lay (to lose) a horse. This means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways.

"Councils prepare to set tax rises

Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.

Authorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%. The finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. They say much additional government money is for new initiatives. Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: ""Last week in parliament I announced an additional £419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland. ""That's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint."" Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme: ""Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.

""We think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services."" The councils' umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. Mr McCabe has promised them about £8.1bn next year. ""However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services,"" a Cosla spokesman said. Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. The Conservatives accuse the Scottish Executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.

The Tory finance spokesman, Brian Monteith MSP, said: ""Its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs. ""Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what we've seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill."" There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. Linda Knox, Director of the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre at Strathclyde University, said: ""With this current settlement the increase is slowing. At the same time, the burdens on councils are greater than they were. ""The settlement figures don't include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of £325m - in efficiency savings across the settlement period."" Education will be protected from any cuts but Linda Knox says this will mean other services will suffer. She said: ""In practice, that will mean a 4-5% cut for other services. On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.""

"Whitehall shredding increasing - Tories

Civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the Tories suggest.

Some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the Freedom of Information Act's implementation on 1 January. Departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records. But the Tories want the information commissioner to investigate. The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years. But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.

Liberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was ""acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act"". ""Both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny."" Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker said the episode painted an ""unflattering picture of the inner workings of government"". ""It is clear that the government's initial enthusiasm for open government has turned to self-serving cynicism."" Dr Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers.

The Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year - up 22,000 on four years ago when the Act was passed. The number of files destroyed by the Ministry of Defence and the departments of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry has also risen dramatically. Dr Lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner Richard Thomas. Earlier this week, Mr Thomas said he was looking into Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. He said he ""totally condemned"" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January.

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served ""no current purpose"", Mr Thomas said. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or ""the destruction of important records"". The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.

"MPs assess Scots fishing industry

A group of MPs are on a two-day fact-finding mission to Scotland to gather evidence for a report into the UK's fishing industry.

Members of Westminster's environment, food and rural affairs committee will be touring fish markets and talking to fish processors. They will also talk to Fisheries Minister Ross Finnie and scientists. MPs are deciding whether to recommend a new system of ""community quotas"" to conserve fish stocks. The aim is that fishing ports like Peterhead or Fraserburgh would be allocated a quota and local people would decide how to fish it. The scheme is a variation on the local management committees already being established by the European Union.

Details are contained in a Royal Commission report for the UK Government, along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely. Six members of the committee will be in Scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in Aberdeen and Peterhead. They will also speak to Mr Finnie, representatives of the Royal Society and the Sea Fish Industry Authority. Committee chairman Austin Mitchell said some way has to be found of harvesting mixed fisheries without wasting stocks.

"Research fears over Kelly's views

Scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary Ruth Kelly's religious views could hamper vital scientific research.

Ms Kelly, who is Catholic, is reported to be ""pro-life"" and has opposed embryo research. Medical Research Council Professor Nancy Rothwell said Ms Kelly's views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists. The Department for Education and Skills would not comment on the concerns.

A spokeswoman said: ""It is not news that Ms Kelly is a Catholic but we are not going into any details on this."" But she added that claims Ms Kelly was in charge of a £1bn university research budget were not true. It was down to the Higher Education Funding Council and the research councils to decide on universities' research allocations. British law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells, master cells that can develop into all the body's tissue types. This cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments. However, it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos.

Professor Rothwell, who is also vice-president of research at Manchester University, told the Times Higher Education Supplement it would worry her ""a great deal"" if ministers were anti-stem cell. She said: ""The views of ministers in the DfES do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists. ""You can't have a higher education policy that is at odds with the government's science policy."" Head of developmental genetics at the National Institute of Medical Research, Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, said he had witnessed the confused situation in the US where many religious groups opposed the practice. He said: ""If someone as senior as Ruth Kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country. It is very worrying."" But fertility expert Lord Winston said he thought it was ""rather good"" ministers held ethical views. Concerns have also been raised by ""pro-choice"" organisations that Ms Kelly's views might affect sex education policy in schools.

Family Planning Association chief executive, Anne Weyman, said teaching pupils about contraception and abortion were key. ""Young people must be informed about all the issues within sexual health, which include contraception and abortion. ""I think it is very important that the government maintains its commitment to the teenage pregnancy strategy."" Currently, individual schools devise their own sex education policies based on a framework provided by the DfES. Ms Kelly has not set out her detailed views on either issue yet, but has said she intends to put parents first in education policy. This would include the quality of teaching, classroom discipline and academic standards in schools, she said.

"Army chiefs in regiments decision

Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.

A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.

Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.

Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: ""The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. ""They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world."" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: ""They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly."" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.

"Student 'inequality' exposed

Teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.

The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. But the percentage of poorer students ""hardly changed at all"", said its chief executive, Sir Howard Newby. Increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.

The Hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. Participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in Kensington and Chelsea, 65% in the City of London and Westminster and 62% in Sheffield Hallam, down to 10% in Bristol South and Leeds Central and 8% in Nottingham North and Sheffield Brightside.

Sir Howard said the report highlighted the ""entrenched divisions"" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. He told BBC News: ""We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. In fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. ""The issue is, I think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people.""

He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.

Tuition fees and student loans in England and Wales - and the different fee regime in Scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994. In the poorest areas, the gap was 30% in women's favour and growing faster than anywhere else. The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: ""We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."" Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. From 2006 upfront tuition fees in England would be removed, with grants for the less well off. The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: ""It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. ""Tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access."" The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. The National Union of Students argued the opposite - that the situation was ""likely to get much worse, with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration"".

"Kennedy to make temple address

Charles Kennedy is set to address 2,000 people at a Hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters.

The Liberal Democrat leader will visit the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Temple in Neasden, north west London. He will say Labour ""can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of Britain's ethnic minorities"". Mr Kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of ""all races"" over the Iraq war and call for a ""balanced approach"" to tackling terrorism. Saturday's speech comes days after the Lib Dems launched their ethnic minority mini-manifesto. Mr Kennedy is to tell the audience: ""Many people in Britain, of all races, cultures and religions, were angry about the way we were taken to war in Iraq. ""And they saw the principled stand the Liberal Democrats took at the time.""

He will also say that the Lib Dems want to ""restore Britain's reputation on the world stage"" by fighting international poverty and climate change, and protecting human rights. Mr Kennedy will say that a ""balanced approach"" to tackling terrorism would mean ""tough measures to make Britain safe - but not at the expense of people's fundamental legal rights like has happened at Belmarsh"". He will say it also means acting through the United Nations on terrorism. Mr Kennedy held talks with Tony Blair on Friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest. He said afterwards that the Prime Minister had offered some ""movement"" to address his concerns. The plans face trouble in the Lords if Conservative and Lib Dem opposition continues.

 ""Trust, plain-speaking and straight talking is something which matters so much to me as a politician and as a man that I have decided, of my own volition, to request an independent review of the allegations that I misused my position.""

""I don't think anyone can say I have said one thing in public and done another in private."" ""It would be dangerous territory if I wasn't practising what I preach which is to always accept responsibility, always accept the consequences of your actions. 

 ""None of us believe countering terrorism is about party politics.""

""I accepted by necessity we have to have prevention under a new category which is to intervene before the act is committed, rather than do so by due process after the act is committed when it's too late,"" he said in reference to new anti-terrorism measures.

"No election TV debate, says Blair

Tony Blair has said he will not take part in a TV debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election.

""We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no,"" he said at his monthly news conference. In October Tory leader Michael Howard said Mr Blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go head-to-head. In recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate, although it has never happened. Before the 2001 election, plans for a debate between Mr Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy collapsed. In 1997 a debate between Mr Blair and John Major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed. Televised debates have become the high point of the US presidential election campaigns.

"What the election should really be about?

A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. Here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected Spring poll.

We've called for the state pension to be increased from £79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £105.45. That's what we're calling for. Many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.

We've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. This will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. Once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. It's our way of putting the politicians on notice. We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. Before 1997 most pensioners voted Conservative. In 1997 and 2001 they voted Labour. But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around. They cannot take that vote for granted.

Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue. He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.

That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.

We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs. Various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. We don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out.

It is hard to say whether we will be successful. We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.

Repealing the Hunting Bill.

We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. We are hoping to hear in the New Year. Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid. So there's a lot of legal territory to go. We are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. Whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. It is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.

It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face. It's exactly what the prime minister did not want. He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.

People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. It is another sort of form of shooting for sport. The principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant.

We will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK. We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors. With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.

I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure. But it will mobilise public opinion. Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.

The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.

Firstly, we have our website. It features our campaigns and changes every day. Secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. Thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. We will invite the opinion formers, MPs, journalists and others. The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.

I think we will be successful. It's very much the language being used by the main political parties. Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.

Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. We have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing. Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about £750. If you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that.

If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. What it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.

We will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.

"Brown and Blair face new rift claims

For the umpteenth time, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.

This time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. It dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. As he told journalists: ""I am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. There is a complete unity of purpose."" And he again heaped praise on Mr Brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for Mr Brown after the election.

So why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? By now Mr Blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. He snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. Well, not really, as it happens.

And he repeated what a great man Gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. Although in the next breath he declared: ""I get increasingly alarmed by what I read in the newspapers"" before catching himself on and quickly adding: ""In so far as I read them of course."" He probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.

As far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options. The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. If that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. The second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous Downing Street grid - to avert just such allegations.

Either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. And there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. Firstly, the prime minister insisted on Wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get G8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt.

Then, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Aid minister Hilary Benn and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott - without mentioning the other. All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. The fact that he used an article in the Guardian newspaper to set out what he believed ""should"" be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of Britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit Africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister's ""turf"" - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. The prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. But the big fear with many on the Labour benches now is that, unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry, it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.

"Blair 'said he would stand down'

Tony Blair promised Gordon Brown he would stand down before the next election, a new book about the chancellor claims.

But the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the Cabinet, according to the book. The book by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other. The book, Brown's Britain, said Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust.

The author's sources, all unnamed ""allies"" of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, said the prime minister felt the Iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party.

The book, serialised in the Sunday Telegraph, alleges that Mr Blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy PM John Prescott in November 2003 of his intention to stand down. ""At that stage he saw Gordon Brown and said, 'look you are the next most influential member of the government, I need your help to get through the next year,"" Mr Peston said. ""I myself recognise that I'm going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.'"" But he changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims.

Mr Peston told BBC News: ""My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. ""What the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. ""I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."" There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. Rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold Mr Blair's monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""Marshall Plan"" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster.

Former welfare minister Frank Field MP criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on GMTV's Sunday Programme.

""What sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out?"" the Labour MP for Birkenhead asked. He said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so. Conservative policy co-ordinator David Cameron, MP for Witney, added: ""If it wasn't so serious it would be funny. ""But it is serious - you've got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime, poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other."" Carol Walker, BBC News 24 political correspondent, added: ""There is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign. ""And clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.""

"Blair dismisses quit claim report

Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.

""You don't do deals over jobs like this,"" the prime minister told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004. Mr Blair said the claims were ""reheated from six months ago"" and that he was concentrating on running the country. Mr Blair said: ""I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.

""What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country."" The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other.

It claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down. According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: ""Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down."" But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.

Mr Peston told BBC News: ""My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.

""I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."" But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: ""When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. ""All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims."" He admitted to a ""sense of frustration"" about the allegations which he said had been made ""countless times"".

There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""Marshall Plan"" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a ""load of nonsense"". Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so.

Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of ""squabbling like schoolboys"". He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: ""This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better."" The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was ""getting in the way of good government"". ""Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election."" During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a ""big role"" at the general election.

"Could rivalry overshadow election?

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.

Along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues, they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of Britain. It is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: ""For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can."" Those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.

Meanwhile the likes of Health Secretary John Reid and Labour peer Lord Haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. And they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. Lord Haskins even suggested Mr Blair should reinstate Mr Brown as the central figure in the election planning.

But this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. They believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. And it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip. Few in Westminster actually believe that, simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.

For example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. Even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories, they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.

Mr Blair talked about the ""New"" Labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label. And Mr Brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. That claim was repeated in Robert Peston's book, a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive Downing Street soap opera is nowhere near its final act.

For his part, Mr Brown insists his only motivation was to get Labour re-elected.

The trouble is, both men have fallen short of offering simple, straightforward denials of the central claims. So they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. The first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. They started with and are sustained by ""friends"" of the two men. One only had to listen to the chancellor's friend and former spin chief Charlie Whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister's apparent attempts to confound Mr Brown's leadership ambitions. But it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides.

There are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. It is no secret in Westminster, for example, that Downing Street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.

Then there are the actions of the men themselves. Gordon Brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. The prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. Meanwhile large numbers of backbench MPs insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media-only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. Either way, there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the Labour party serious damage. There are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. But with probably only four months to the next election, that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.

"Brown in appeal for Labour unity

Gordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.

The chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be ""diverted or distracted"" from tackling the challenges faced by the country. His only ""motivation"" was to ensure Labour was re-elected, he insisted. Mr Blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for Gordon Brown as old news. According to a new book, Brown's Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.

In an interview with BBC One's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Blair said: ""I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't. ""What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.""

In a separate interview with BBC political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Brown said: ""It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government. ""I think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that I have. ""That is my purpose in politics, and that is what every day I seek to do. And I am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is Tony Blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip. ""The only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country."" Mr Brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on Saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.

But Mr Peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other and that Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war. He then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book. Andrew Marr said: ""This is enormously damaging. Gordon Brown knows it as well as Tony Blair. ""I think the relationship is genuinely, privately, very poor indeed. Things are very difficult."" He added: ""Lots of ministers believe Tony Blair will attempt to move Gordon Brown out of the Treasury after the election. ""That depends on whether there's still a Labour government and their majority.""

Senior MPs are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of Labour backbenchers on Monday.

Health Secretary John Reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging Labour's re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven. Fresh speculation of a rift recently followed Mr Blair and Mr Brown's separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""Marshall Plan"" for Africa.

"Blair pledges unity to Labour MPs

Tony Blair has sought to reassure Labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the party's bid for a third term in power.

Mr Blair was speaking to MPs amid fresh rumours of a rift with Gordon Brown. A new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to Mr Brown to stand down before the next general election. The chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo Alan Milburn for a Labour poster launch this week. Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on Monday: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. A new book, Brown's Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, says Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.

It has caused a new wave of concern among Labour MPs gearing up to defend their seats in an election, widely expected to be held in May, and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the PLP meeting. Health Secretary John Reid earlier warned that Labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. He told BBC News: ""Those who co-operate or inspire these books, in my view, have to know that, whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure, they always do it by damaging the record, the unity and the re-election chances of the Labour Party and the government."" Mr Blair on Sunday dismissed claims of broken promises, saying: ""I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.""

In a separate BBC interview, Mr Brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by ""gossip"". ""It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government,"" he said.

On Monday, Mr Blair's spokesman said: ""The prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want."" Mr Brown says he discussed the election campaign with Mr Blair on Saturday and promised to play his part.

Mr Peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"". Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war.

He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. Mr Brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything Mr Blair told him. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox likened the two men to ""self-obsessed schoolboys"". Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said their personal ambition was ""getting in the way of good government"". Ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock said Mr Blair and Mr Brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage Labour or British interests. He told BBC Radio Five Live that Mr Brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.

"Blair and Brown criticised by MPs

Labour MPs have angrily criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.

A meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise Labour's election hopes. The PM insisted nothing would derail Labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. Mr Brown will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. In what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside Alan Milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader John Prescott for the event in London on Tuesday. Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001.

Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.""

The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. New speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in Brown's Britain, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, which suggested Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown. Labour's Paul Flynn said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had a ""scorching"" from MPs adding: ""It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other.""

Backbencher Stephen Pound said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if Mr Blair and Mr Brown did not ""stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing"". Lord Campbell-Savours, a former MP, challenged Mr Brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. Mr Prescott said MPs were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.

""They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday. Mr Prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.

The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. ""Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,"" he joked. Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let ""gossip"" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. The Conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the Liberal Democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.

"Labour MPs' fears over squabbling

If there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of Labour MPs it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.

And it was largely that fear that led to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. As one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: ""It is time they realised it's not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt."" It is a sentiment that is now running throughout the Labour benches with MPs eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.

As Paul Flynn said: ""What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect.""

Stephen Pound echoed the message, saying: ""We know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the Labour Party but for this country, is the appearance of division. We remember the 1980s"". They backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped, the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be ""named and shamed"". The dressing down appears to have done the trick, with Mr Brown joining his alleged rival Alan Milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in Mr Brown's stead - and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at an election poster launch. But the effect of all this is to have achieved two things. Firstly, nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors. Even Mr Prescott admitted that, had he still been a backbencher, he would have been giving Mr Blair and Mr Brown the same message.

Secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has, to all intents and purposes, kicked off. But whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen.

Even as the MPs were expressing their fears it emerged that, while Mr Brown is in Africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. And he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be ""New"" Labour through and through. Similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. None the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the Brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand. For example, will those Brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister's timing or subject matter, as may have been the case in the past? What all seem agreed on, however, is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. Mind you, we have heard similar pledges before.

"'Poll Idols' face first hurdles

Vote For Me - ITV1's Pop Idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.

Over the next four days, hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. The winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election, which is expected in the spring. But opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics. ""Any of them would make competent MPs,"" former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Mr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of ""odd balls"" and the show will engage ordinary voters. ""If it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that,"" he said. But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of ""corrupting politics"".

He said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters ""with that bunch of nutters"". To give Sir Bernard his dues, Monday evening's opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. Among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyth's birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister. The show follows the time-honoured Pop Idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.

The contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. Then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. They were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-ITN political editor John Sergeant, with television host Lorraine Kelly taking the Nicki Chapman role. But the real star of the show is Kelvin MacKenzie, in the Simon Cowell, Mr Nasty seat.

The former Sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. His advice for one young contestant was to ""get a haircut and a brain transplant"". Wheelchair user Kevin Donnellon was asked: ""Why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled?"" ""Don't you care about the Inuit?"", implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner Barry Lim. ""I don't care about them. I care about myself and when the sun's shining I think - fantastic,"" replied Mr MacKenzie.

Mr Lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes. ""When the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers Mr Brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in Britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax,"" observed Mr MacKenzie. ""That was an total disaster. I just couldn't seem to think of things to say,"" a crestfallen Mr Lim confided in the show's presenter, Jonathan Maitland. Irfan Hanif, a 25-year-old doctor from Bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by Mr MacKenzie's suggestion that instead of being treated by the NHS, young drunks should ""given a good beating"" and left to die. Dominic Carman - son of late libel lawyer George Carman - was voted through to the final 25, on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. Opinion was more divided over Rodney Hylton-Potts, a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. Mr MacKenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress. ""He could join the rest of the crooks in the Houses of Parliament."" But Ms Kelly said she ""would not trust him as far as she could throw him"". The series continues throughout the week, with the public given the chance to evict one prospective MP every night. ITV will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner, but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.

"Labour seeks to quell feud talk

Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.

Mr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.

The event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: ""You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.""

He refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: ""Of course I trust the prime minister."" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe"". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign ""which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country"".

Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: ""The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H."" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.

The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs.

On Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: ""They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line."" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. ""Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,"" he joked.

"Labour's election love-in

Peace and love have been in short supply in the Labour party in recent days.

If press reports are to be believed, Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of Labour's next election manifesto. But the pair were all smiles on Tuesday morning, as they joined John Prescott to unveil Labour's latest poster campaign. The event - at Old Billingsgate Fish Market on the banks of the Thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity. And the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. It was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.

The first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - Labour's speakers crackled to life with the sound of Booker T and the MGs. Then a VW camper van trundled into view, decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages - ""lowest mortgage rate for 40 years"". As the side-door slid open, it looked for one glorious moment as if the Cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together, Scooby Doo-style. But, sadly, it wasn't the Cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking Labour students. Two were dressed as Regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting ""the longest period of economic growth for 200 years"". Another pair of students were in a Beatle wig and Sgt Pepper jacket to highlight the ""lowest interest rates since the 1960s"".

The remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the ""lowest unemployment since the seventies"".

The politicians - led out by John Prescott - were soberly-suited as always. The event may have been designed to highlight Labour's economic success under Mr Brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge. The chancellor walked side-by-side with Mr Milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone. But it was Mr Milburn who took centre stage, speaking of the ""positive campaign"" the party hoped to stage in the ""coming weeks and months"".

The mobile poster vans would ""let people know Britain is working again"". Mr Brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of Labour's ""shared purpose"" and ""united dedication"". It was left to Mr Prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor's record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming Labour has met all of its promises. The event was carefully stage-managed to underline Cabinet unity. And, more specifically, to demonstrate the ""central role"" Mr Brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of Mr Milburn.

But keen students of body language will have had a field day. There was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only Mr Prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself. Mr Milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor, as he spoke, nodding thoughtfully. But it was the former health secretary's final gesture, placing an arm on Mr Brown's back as they walked away from the microphones, which was perhaps the most telling. Thanks for dropping by Gordon, he might have been saying.

"Howard taunts Blair over splits

Tony Blair's feud with Gordon Brown is damaging the way the UK is governed, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed in a heated prime minister's questions.

Mr Howard asked: ""How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?"" That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters. But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people's priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour. ""He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to,"" he said. The chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book.

Brown's Britain, by Robert Peston, says there is mutual animosity between the two men. It claims Mr Blair said in November 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election. But he went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him, it says.

Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe."" Mr Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday. He again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit.

The Tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor. He declared: ""He is the deals on meals prime minister. No wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater."" He continued: ""How can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government, how can they clean up our hospitals when they don't clean up their act?"" Mr Blair said he would not respond to ""tittle tattle in books"" and promised to hail Labour's record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order ""from now until polling day"". Later at their poster launch Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how ""juvenile"" the prime minister and chancellor were.

Labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on Tuesday, where Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. But Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy told BBC News: ""The government is clearly split at the top. This kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody."" Later this week Mr Blair is expected to outline the direction of his party's next election manifesto. The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made Mr Peston's book.

"How political squabbles snowball

It's become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.

But this analysis in fact gets it wrong. It's not just children who fight - adults do too. And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.

Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.) Now this isn't because the participants are stupid - it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them. Indeed, there's even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. Nothing as obscure as ""post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory"" which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.

It's often referred to as the ""prisoner's dilemma"", based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. The story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime, and are locked up in separate cells. But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. Without a confession, the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.

Clearly the prisoners' best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime. And he tells them that if they don't confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they'll get life. Now, if you are prisoner confronted with this choice, your best bet is to confess. If your partner doesn't confess, you'll get off completely. And if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life. The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. Don't worry if you don't entirely follow it - you can to look it up on Google, where there are 283,000 entries on it.

The prisoners' dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively, but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.

A cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both Russia and America would be better off with just a few arms, rather than a lot of arms. But as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other, an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms, results in arms levels that are too high. What economics tells us is that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it's hard to escape the perverse logic of it. It's no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. Somehow, the incentives have to change.

In the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. Every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments, solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. An example, is the famous rule that ""one divides, the other chooses"" as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in. If the rest of the party can enforce that, they'll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.

"Blair looks to election campaign

Tony Blair's big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.

That poll may still be about 16 weeks away, but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing. The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. There was a detailed account of the government's past record, with a major emphasis on the economy and public services. There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown. And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly ""New"" Labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.

There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a ""New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society"". His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. And, for some, that means showing that New Labour actually does stand for something - that it is, as he said, more than ""an electoral device"".

To that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters. In a key section, he declared: ""In our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity. ""For the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. Every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood. ""Every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. Every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance. ""Home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it. ""The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions"".

Under what is to be the general election slogan ""Britain is working"", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour. That might get under the skin of Mr Brown, but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor Britain has had. Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men, in so far as there is one, is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.

An unremittingly ""New"" Labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. The chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance, although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle. With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word. But for now, all eyes have been focused on the next general election. And for many in Westminster, Mr Blair's performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 May.

"Tories unveil quango blitz plans

Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.

Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than £4.3bn. Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.

The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. Their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.

Announcing the plans, Mr Redwood said: ""Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. ""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" His party leader, Michael Howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. ""Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain,"" he said. ""In the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. They've seen their pensions knocked for six. ""They're being squeezed by extra taxes. The forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic Britain.""

The government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng attacked the Tory plans. ""The Conservatives are committed to cutting Labour's public spending plans by a massive £35 billion,"" he said. ""Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police."" The Liberal Democrats have said they would cut the number of Whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.

"Peers debate Crown succession law

Peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.

Labour peer Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. The private member's bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. The Fabian Society's Sundar Katwala said the change was ""long overdue"" and that he expected a ""warm response"". The political reform group's general secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme there were some ""very out-dated features"" at the heart of Britain's constitution.

""In 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. ""We hope they are warm towards it and don't say this is the wrong time."" He pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. Mr Katwala added: ""This is long overdue. Parliament will have to do it eventually, the government, and I hope all of the political parties, might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos.""

But he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support, it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. He said he hoped the bill would be a ""gentle nudge"" to the government and suggested it would ""demand a response"". The bill, which is in the Lords for its second reading, has been adopted by former chief whip Ann Taylor in the Commons. The rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the Act of Settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for Parliament to determine the title to the throne.

"UKIP's secret weapon?

By any measure, New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner.

This is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for Bill Clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory. But Morris is no ideologue. He has worked as election strategist for any number of Republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from Mexico to Uruguay. Now he is back in London as the UK Independence Party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the Ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko. If there is one regular criticism levelled at Morris, it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. That he enjoys the game more than the politics.

So why Britain and why UKIP which, despite its recent EU election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. On this subject, Morris appears almost evangelical.

""I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman. ""I had just written a piece saying how the English Channel was now wider than the Atlantic which he liked and it went from there"". But what is it about UKIP that particularly attracts him? Many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics. ""I think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism"". A great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a New Yorker post 11 September. ""It is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better, who don't believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined. ""That's international bankers, the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and, primarily, the European Union"".

So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. ""The Tory party is schizophrenic about Europe. But until somebody says they are willing to leave the EU they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as Michael Howard is pledged to do). ""It's like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: 'before I can proceed with the robbery I want to make clear I am not going to shoot anybody'"". Possibly a very American analogy, but another great soundbite. ""The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain - and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it"".

So is UKIP's job to destroy the Tories, as former member Robert Kilroy-Silk once notoriously declared? ""No. The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move.

""But it's not just to shift the Tories. I think UKIP had a huge amount to do with Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and I think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"". And, while we are on the subject of Mr Kilroy-Silk, Mr Morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites. ""Robert Kilroy Silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one"".

So what is the big plan for the general election. How will he achieve the breakthrough? ""Look, we are not going to be forming the next government,"" he said. Neither does UKIP have to fight every seat. As with the 2004 US presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in Britain. So, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the Commons. He also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll. ""The internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). People just did it"". ""Anything can happen in the next general election. There is an inherent instability at the moment. ""Labour and the Tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"".

That might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with UKIP and others holding the balance of power. It is a huge task, surely. But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is Labour's for the taking. UKIP's performance in last year's European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus. And after all, he has a reputation to sustain.

"More reforms ahead says Milburn

Labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power, the party's election chief Alan Milburn has said.

He pledged Labour would encourage more people to achieve their aspirations. ""What we want is for more people to earn and own,"" Mr Milburn told BBC Radio 4's Today show. Tory Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin called Labour ""a brilliant machine for talking about things"" but said it did not deliver policies the country needs. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats' President Simon Hughes said: ""New Labour has lost people's confidence in a way Old Labour never did."" Mr Milburn told Today that Labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in Britain.

Pressed on incapacity benefits, he said the tax and welfare system must ""provide the right incentives to people"". ""No-one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work, providing the right level of support is there for them"". However, backbench Labour MP Karen Buck warned against proposed changes in such benefits. She told the Today programme: ""If the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work, on the one hand. And it is not going to improve our electoral chances on the other."" Mr Milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between Gordon Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair.

He stressed that Mr Brown would play the same role that he did in the last election. Mr Milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to Labour's Fabian Society, in which he also praised Mr Brown as one of the leaders of the party's reform process. In the speech, he backed choice in schools and hospitals, wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system. Mr Milburn insisted that government reform must continue. ""Our task is to rebuild the New Labour coalition around 'one nation politics' that recognise, while life is hard for many, all should have the chance to succeed,"" he said. ""There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. In our first two terms we have raised it. In our third term we have to break it."" Voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the 1960s, he also told his audience.

Oliver Letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services, such as cleaner hospitals, discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets. He said ministers had not delivered cleaner hospitals, with 5,000 people dying from infections last year. New Labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools, and which would give parents choice, he went on. For the Lib Dems, Simon Hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn't be tuition fees and more debt ""have been given exactly the opposite"". He added: ""Under New Labour, all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative.""

"Teens 'know little' of politics

Teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics - and have little knowledge.

Only a quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that Labour was the government, the Tories were the official Opposition and the Lib Dems were the third party. Almost all could identify Tony Blair, but only one in six knew who Michael Howard was, and just one in 10 recognised Charles Kennedy. The ICM survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog Ofsted. Nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for. And 4% of those questioned thought the Conservatives were in power - while 2% of them believed the Lib Dems were. The survey also looked at issues of nationality. It found the Union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being British. Many of the pupils also looked on themselves as English, Scottish or Welsh, rather than British; while the notion of being European hardly occurred to anyone.

"Defection timed to hit tax pledge

With impeccable and precisely-calculated timing, Tory defector Robert Jackson and his new Labour bosses have attempted to overshadow Michael Howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending.

With just about everyone in Westminster now working towards a May general election, Mr Howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the Tories' resolutely depressing poll showings. The big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts. And it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. He and his shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now, but without any concrete pledges. But Mr Howard announced that, of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings, £12bn will be used to plug Labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in Mr Letwin's first budget. He would not be precise, but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax. But he did, for the first time, say there would be such tax cuts.

""At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less"". It is the Tories' attempt to open that famed ""clear blue water"" between them and the Labour party and return to a traditional Tory agenda that will both reassure the middle England voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core Conservative voters. So it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when Robert Jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the Labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact. Mr Howard, however, was dismissive. ""These things happen from time to time. There are disagreements between Robert Jackson and me.

""The election is not going to be decided on what Robert Jackson did,"" he added. And that is certainly true. The election will be decided on ""the economy stupid"". Other issues like the Iraq war and the ""trust"" thing will also play a major part. But it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote. And many on the Tory benches have been crying out for Mr Howard to get back onto the old Tory tax cuts agenda. Mr Howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first. With polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts, he has suggested that is exactly what he will do. Whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen.

"Tory leader unveils spending plan

Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save £35bn in government spending by tackling waste.

The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. ""Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did"", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.

The bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the ""unfair taxes"". ""Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,"" Mr Howard insisted. ""Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. ""So part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. ""The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.""

Mr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by £1.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James' proposals.

Mr Howard said: ""All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less."" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: ""None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is £35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard."" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: ""People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of £35bn worth of savings. ""This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities."" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests. And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.

"Kennedy looks to election gains

They may not know quite how to describe their position in British politics - the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.

But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a ""fading"" force. And he insisted there was ""no limit"" to his party's ambitions in the coming poll. And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.

And Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party's Westminster HQ. He would make no predictions other than that he expected the Lib Dems to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election.

The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives. He was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to ""prop up"" either of the other big parties after the election.

There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats. The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.

Labour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Lib Dems allowing the Tories to win some seats. But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power. The Lib Dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on Iraq. But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.

"'Best person' for top legal job

The ""best person for the job"" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.

Under reforms, the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions. ""The lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor,"" said courts minister Christopher Leslie. The Constitutional Reform Bill was entering its second reading on Monday. Mr Leslie said: ""The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons."" Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK's highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.

In December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. The peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed. Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor. He said: ""What matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. ""It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.""

Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an ""exceptional institution,"" providing a ""champion of the independence of the judiciary"". The government had initially proposed to take this institution and ""smash it to pieces,"" Mr Grieve said. Convention should be ""nurtured and celebrated,"" but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have ""great difficulty"" in getting the Bill through Parliament. Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the Bill was ""largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive"". But the Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham admitted the lord chancellor's role and office ""cannot be frozen in aspic"".

"The memory driving Brown's mission

The memory Gordon Brown says keeps returning to him - the one that he says is burnt into him - is that of a 12 year-old girl, whose parents died of Aids, and who is HIV positive herself.

Mr Brown seems haunted by her eyes, desolate of all hope. And then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism: an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of Kenya's largest slum, advancing with crowded menace, flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing, before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of ""free education - free education for all"". Mr Brown's message generally, that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered. But he is such a pivotal figure in British politics, it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this. His answer, in part, is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father's church. Ever since, he says, Africa has been important to him.

I've absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt. But he also believes it is time for the world to see a new Gordon Brown. Not the dull, reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion - and it just so happens the Labour Party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators.

There's also a sense of liberation. If Mr Blair won't allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he'd much rather be out examining social problems in the raw. It also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties: scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself. If he can help the world's poor just a little, then it shows politics isn't worthless. But is his vision for Africa too grand? Can poverty in the continent really be halved? Brown replies that no one thought the Berlin Wall would ever come down either. He's still got to overcome - not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world - but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just won't in the end spend wisely.

"Howard dismisses Tory tax fears

Michael Howard has dismissed fears from some Conservatives that his plans for £4bn tax cuts are too modest.

He defended the package, saying it was a plan for the Tories' first Budget and he hoped to be able to go further. The Tories on Monday highlighted £35bn in ""wasteful"" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. Labour and the Liberal Democrats say the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. The Tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party's MPs that Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. Now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted.

Tory backbencher Edward Leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the Financial Times: ""I would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts."" Interviewed on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show, Mr Howard said: ""It is perfectly true that I am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.

""On the other side, there are people who say we won't be able to achieve these tax cuts. ""I think we have got it about right."" Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes. He added: ""I would like to be able to do more, and over time I am sure we will be able to do more, but at the start, we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go, in our first Budget. ""I have got to be responsible about this.""

The latest Tory plans came as campaigning for the election - widely expected in May - gathered pace. The Liberal Democrats launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the ""authentic opposition"", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees. Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable also branded the Tory plans as ""fantasy economics"". Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a ""fraudulent prospectus"". The party on Tuesday challenged the Tories to publish the full report from David James, the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. But the Tories are in turn demanding that Tony Blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.

"Donor attacks Blair-Brown 'feud'

The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.

Duncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its ""poor"" response to the Asian tsunami crisis. His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point. Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour £50,000. He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.

The 52-year-old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.

Robert Peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. Mr Bannatyne said: ""Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. ""Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition."" The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.

And he branded the UK government's response to the tsunami as ""piecemeal and poor"". ""The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,"" he said. ""The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more."" British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon's Den. But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.

In a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown's prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour's election. But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not ""perceived as a problem by the voters,"" adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was ""not an alternative source of opposition to the government"". He warned the ""Abstentions Party"" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair's promise to produce an ""unremittingly New Labour"" election manifesto. His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain's biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.

"Howard and Blair tax pledge clash

Tony Blair has said voters will have to wait for Labour's manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.

The premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget. Mr Blair derided Tory claims they could cut £35bn in ""wasteful spending"" saying the party had got its sums wrong. The two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. Mr Howard told MPs that ""every independent expert"" from the International Monetary Fund to the Institute of Fiscal Studies had suggested the ""government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes"". Mr Blair replied: ""I think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the Treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right."" The Tories on Monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn, although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.

They also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. But Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes. The Liberal Democrats have also launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the ""authentic opposition"", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees.

"What really divides the parties

So what is the gap between Labour and the Tories nowadays?

One Starbucks, one Rymans and one small Greek cafe as it happens. Both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters, with Labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the Tories' new headquarters in Victoria Street, just down the road from the Commons. That should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. Unlike 2001, there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside, or to buy scooters, to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events.

And, to all intents and purposes, we already appear to be in that general election campaign. Certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator Alan Milburn, in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish New Labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event.

""Welcome to the unremittingly New Labour media centre,"" he said. And I'll bet he hadn't checked that one with Gordon Brown. Along with Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson and Minister for Work Jane Kennedy, he then went on to tear into the Tory plans to scrap the New Deal welfare-to-work scheme, which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300,000 in unemployment. And they ridiculed the claims made on Monday by Michael Howard that he could save £35 billion of Labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £4 billion of tax cuts. Labour has come up with a figure of £22 billions worth of efficiency savings so, understandably perhaps, believe Mr Howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra £13 billion. These figures, based on the two parties' own detailed studies, will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. Wednesday was just the start.

"Amnesty chief laments war failure

The lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups, Amnesty International's chief has said.

In a lecture at the London School of Economics, Irene Khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 September, 2001. She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. And it had to fight poverty, not just focus on political rights for elites.

Ms Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems. ""What's a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war,"" she said. ""By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war."" Ms Khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world. ""The human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights,"" she said. That was accompanied by a crisis of governance, where the United Nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account.

The Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism. ""Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups,"" she said. Ms Khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system. There needed to be a drive to use simpler language, talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. Such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world, she said.

The human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. Al-Qaeda, for example, was not going to be impressed by a traditional Amnesty letter writing campaign. More also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations. Amnesty International members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation's work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife. ""We would be an elitist bunch working for the elites, for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read,"" she said. Despite her concerns, Ms Khan dubbed herself a ""hope-monger"", saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.

"Blair sees greater Bush consensus

George W Bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as US President, Tony Blair has said.

The prime minister said Mr Bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism. He understood that ""the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights"", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper. Mr Bush was sworn in at a ceremony in Washington DC on Thursday.

Echoing the new US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of US policy since the war in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with Mr Bush. The president understood that while military and security measures were important, there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the world's problems.

Turning to critics' fears that the US was poised for further military action, Mr Blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against Iran. The prime minister conceded that the US had ""what appears to be a harder position"" towards the state than Europe. But the prime minister pointed out that until now the US had allowed Britain, France and Germany to take the lead in trying to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. Following claims that US forces had worked inside Iran to identify potential targets, Mr Blair was asked if the SAS had also been in the country. ""We never answer questions about special forces, but do not take that as indicating an affirmative,"" said Mr Blair.

Mr Blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights. ""It is significant, in my view, that he is coming to Europe as his first foreign visit,"" said Mr Blair. Following his inauguration, Mr Bush is due in Europe at the end of January.

"Kilroy-Silk quits 'shameful' UKIP

Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk has quit the UK Independence Party and accused it of betraying its supporters.

The MEP said he was ashamed to have joined the party, which he labelled as a ""joke"". He plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called Veritas - Latin for truth. UKIP leader Roger Knapman said he would ""break open the champagne"", adding: ""It was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'."" However, he did say the ex-chat show host had been ""quite useful initially"". ""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the (European) election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" Mr Knapman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Knapman rejected the idea Mr Kilroy-Silk posed a threat to UKIP and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party.

Mr Kilroy-Silk explained his reasons to his East Midlands constituents at a meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire. His decision came as UKIP officials began a process which could have triggered Mr Kilroy-Silk's expulsion. It marks the end of his membership of UKIP after just nine months. It began with a flood of publicity which helped UKIP into third place in last June's European elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership.

Mr Kilroy-Silk accused his fellow UKIP MEPs of being content with growing fat ""sitting on their backsides"" in Brussels. He told BBC News 24: ""I tried to change the party, I nagged all the way through the summer to do things, to get moving because I thought it was criminal what they were doing, it was a betrayal."" Mr Kilroy-Silk also told Sky News there was ""masses of support"" for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen.

UKIP won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the European elections on the back of its call for the UK to leave the European Union In his speech, Mr Kilroy-Silk says the result offered UKIP an ""amazing opportunity"" but the party's leadership had done nothing and ""gone AWOL"". There were no policies, no energy, no vision and no spokespeople, he said. ""The party is going nowhere and I'm embarrassed with its allies in Europe and I'm ashamed to be a member of the party,"" said Mr Kilroy-Silk.

He said his conviction in Britain's right to govern itself had not changed. He would continue that campaign outside UKIP when he contested the general election in an East Midlands constituency. Reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to UKIP's disciplinary committee for bringing the party into ""disrepute"". On Thursday, the party challenged Mr Kilroy-Silk to stand down as an MEP so voters can get a genuine UKIP candidate.

"Blair blasts Tory spending plans

Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a ""ludicrous improbability"".

The prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in ""wasteful"" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing ""inefficiencies"" which had ""burgeoned"" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: ""The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.

""I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,"" he said. ""It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government."" Mr Blair added: ""They, the Conservatives have learned nothing."" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.

Mr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. ""So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight."" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. ""Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,"" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for ""huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy"". ""The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,"" he concluded.

Gordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be ""distracted or diverted"". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: ""We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.""

Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning ""the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto"". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of ""misrepresenting"" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. ""He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,"" Mr Letwin said. ""Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?""

"Lib Dems' 'bold' election policy

Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an ""honest choice"" at the next general election.

With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. It is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the Lib Dems and the other two. With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack. Now he is promising to levy a ""modest"" increase of the same amount on earnings over £100,000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. They are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. That last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less.

Labour and the Tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.

Inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases. In many ways the argument between the Lib Dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. But, unlike the old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see ""modest"" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. That is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.

Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not ""foment an artificial debate"" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas. Once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, Mr Kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party. Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be ""significant players"" in the poll. He repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. Mr Kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a Labour government with a small majority would amount to a ""massive vote of no confidence "" in Tony Blair's government. That suggests the Lib Dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful, even pivotal position in a vastly different House of Commons after the next election. It is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.

"Kennedy's cautious optimism

Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.

In his 22 years in the Commons, he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and, he might say, the UK's political and electoral system. But even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time. ""Look, I have already said I am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around,"" he said. He still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another Labour victory of some sort. And his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the Lib Dems as the ""real"" opposition.

But doesn't that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second? He is prepared to go this far: ""A clear conclusion has been reached, including by Conservatives, that the Conservatives are not going to win this election. ""Therefore the potential is there for the Liberal Democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election, given that we have the capacity to take on Labour and win as well as take on the Conservatives and win. ""This is really going to be the first modern three party UK election that we have all experienced"". But haven't we been here before, with suggestions in the 1980s that Labour was finished. Won't voters looking for an alternative to Labour still naturally gravitate to the Conservatives? ""The problem is that, geographically, the Conservative party has melted away in about a third of Britain. ""We have supplanted them as the main alternative to Labour in whole tracts of mainland Britain. And they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary Britain"".

Mr Kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned Labour voters.

He insists his three headline commitments, to be financed from a 1% tax increase on those earning over £100,000 a year, will appeal right across the political spectrum. They are to replace the council tax with a local income tax, provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees. He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour. ""I think the tax argument has moved on a lot in British politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election,"" he said. Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.

""We are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies"".

""That is a clear cut choice for people, one I am very comfortable with and I think will distinguish us from the others"". As to his own future, he is clear. If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament ""on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us"". That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that, if the Tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party. Perhaps then Mr Kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side.

"Hague 'given up' his PM ambition

Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.

Mr Hague, 43, told the Daily Telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too ""boring"" and unfulfilling. Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench. He also told the paper he hopes to remain MP for Richmond, North Yorks, and start a family with wife Ffion. Mr Hague, who recently had published the biography of William Pitt the Younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.

He told the newspaper: ""I don't know whether I will ever go back on to the front, but don't rush me."" Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, Mr Hague replied: ""No. Definitely not."" His determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior Conservative members, who say the party needs him. Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a ""huge boost"" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench. Mr Hague became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36. He said: ""I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. ""I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling."" Mr Hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. ""Maybe I wasn't as driven by politics as I thought I was,"" he said.

"UKIP candidate suspended in probe

Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.

John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: ""We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: ""He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. ""By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. ""It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies."" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: ""I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.""

Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. ""He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken."" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: ""I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.""

"Boothroyd calls for Lords speaker

Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber.

Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. ""Now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it,"" she told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. In 1999 Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords' 750 hereditary peers. That was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution. The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto.

""I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons,"" Lord Falconer told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. ""How it interacts with the Commons is a very, very important issue. ""We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes."" The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker. He is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary.

Lady Boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of Speaker. ""I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords,"" she said. ""I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords. ""I want somebody there who is going to look after that House and do a job there.

"New UKIP defection to 'Veritas'

The UK Independence Party has lost one of its two London Assembly members to Robert Kilroy-Silk's new political party, expected to launch on Wednesday.

Damian Hockney said ex-chatshow host Mr Kilroy-Silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a eurosceptic party. He said Mr Kilroy-Silk had made him deputy party leader of Veritas, Latin for truth. Sources close to Mr Hockney said around eight other members of London UKIP were also planning to jump ship.

Details of the coming week's events were hammered out at a meeting at Mr Kilroy-Silk's Buckinghamshire home on Sunday, the BBC News Website was told. The news came after UKIP suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. UKIP asserts that Mr Hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. Mr Hockney meanwhile told the BBC: ""I believe that Robert Kilroy-Silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the UK Independence Party.""

On the suspension of Mr Houston, UKIP said those who selected him knew nothing of his views. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade.

The document reportedly said: ""We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.

"Baron Kinnock makes Lords debut

Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has officially been made a life peer during a ceremony in the House of Lords.

He will be known Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty - after his former constituency. Lord Kinnock - who led Labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of Britain's EU commissioners. A former critic of the House of Lords, he has said he will use the Upper House to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education. ""I accepted the kind invitation to enter the House of Lords as a working peer for practical political reasons,"" he said when his peerage was first announced. ""It is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression."" During his induction into the Upper House, Lord Kinnock was accompanied by Lords Leader Baroness Amos and Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, a former aide to the ex-Labour leader. It has been a long journey for the new Lord Kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south Wales valleys. Born in 1942 in Tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother, he attended Lewis Boys' School in nearby Pengam, known then as the ""Eton of the valleys"". From there he went to Cardiff University, where he met his future wife Glenys, now a Labour MEP.

After a brief career as a tutor for the Workers' Educational Association, he became an MP at the age of just 28 for his home seat of Bedwellty (later Islwyn). He gained a reputation as a left-wing firebrand, voting against his own Labour government's spending cuts proposals in 1975, and later rejecting a junior post in James Callaghan's administration. But he joined the shadow cabinet in 1980, and after Labour's heavy defeat in the 1983 he was elected leader. He took on the far-left Militant Tendency and began the long process of returning his party to the centre ground. He was not expected to win the 1987 election, when Margaret Thatcher was still riding high, but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to John Major, and stepped down. He remained an MP until 1995, when he resigned to become European commission for transport. Four years later he became vice-president of the European Commission, with responsibility for internal reform. As he assumes the title of Lord Kinnock, he has also become chairman of the British Council, which promotes the UK's reputation for arts, science and education.

"Terror powers expose 'tyranny'

The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.

Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tells BBC News of his personal response to the move.



There is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of Britain. Or so says Home Secretary Charles Clarke. My reaction? So what? It is not that I am cynical or just do not care. I care about this country very much.

But in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us. My point is, the British have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.

I was born on 25 August, 1938. The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler. A week after my first birthday, the threat had become reality. We were at war. My father wore a uniform for five years. After 1945 we yearned for peace at last. But in 1946 Winston Churchill told us - from the Baltic to the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across Europe. Behind the Iron Curtain, another genocidal psychopath, another threat. Josef Stalin triggered the Cold War, with the Berlin blockade in 1948. My whole generation was blighted by it.

We were threatened by the nuclear holocaust, the nuclear wind, the nuclear winter. We built shelters that would have sheltered nothing. We spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals. We took silly precautions. Some fought it; some marched futilely against it. Some pretended it was not there. The Cold War lasted 43 years, but we remained a parliamentary democracy. By the early seventies it was terrorism as well. Al Fatah, Black September, Red Brigades, but most of all for us the IRA and the INLA. Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny. That was why the tyrants lost. Civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. Evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes , and one judge, no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised. Informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle. But habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal was not abolished. Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism. Its leaders want to destroy our society; so did the IRA.

It is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA. It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA. It is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the IRA. The prime movers are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the IRA. But we did. And without becoming a tyranny. Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny. But a tyranny is based on the citizen's terror. This is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired.

An interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but I suggest we move one step further. Our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and 'hunting' in the 'shadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart. Rather than focusing upon effect, we should consider the cause, because terrorism does not begin with bombs. Why not try a foreign policy of compassion, it can only enhance our democracy, and share our freedom.

I agree with Frederick Forsyth. We really can't deal with terrorism by turning Britain into a fascist state. What we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians. If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any. Our security services, behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty, rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it, while the real villain gets away. Remember there were no WMD in Iraq. Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.

In this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out. Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?). When ID cards become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the Data Protection Act, and will be readily available to people like GCHQ, with no control by the person whose ID is being checked.

The threat now is new. You cannot compare the threats of past years with now. Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001. The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology. A Kilo of Semtex will flatten a building, a Kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.

The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no. However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.

As somebody of Chinese origin, I can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. Whilst life wasn't perfect, we could make better for ourselves. Now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. We have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions. We have a Prime Minister who spends too much time meddling in US politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of British Citizens at home or abroad. Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions. Let's hope the BBC doesn't get gagged for letting people express their views. The people have the right to know and the BBC's role is to Inform, Educate and Entertain...

I agree. Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties. In the end, the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. The terrorists have already won.

I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth. Yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate. The idea that the ""new terrorism"" demands new powers is erroneous. The evidence of any real terrorist capability in the UK is scant. Ricin, for example, is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.

If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not. We will have lost the precious freedom which Bush and Blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others.

I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they ""knew best"".

When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.

Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully. The government is seeking to introduce a police state. The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years. We are sleep-walking into this. Wake up!

An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence. 2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it. Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses. It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked. We won't have much of a society left to debate !

He's correct in most of what he says. Mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in Northern Ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young Catholics to join the IRA. Administrative detention of Muslims could have a similar effect now.

Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.

I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on. There is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the U.K. but it is very doubtful whether al-Qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. The rise of surveillance cameras, ID cards, the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times, this is the stuff of nightmares. Add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the Home Secretary, and I genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit. Where will this end. As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.

Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise. Thank you.

Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides. He also forgets basic Human Rights were suspended then as now. Experienced Judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times. For very little return and maximum alienation. These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.

Forsyth is wrong. The nature of the current threat is new. It is no longer to our armed forces, as the Soviet threat in the Eastern bloc was. It is to you and I. The terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. The best comparison is therefore the blitz, 1941. At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public. We must not forget we are at war.

I'd say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major UK target is a ""When"" not an ""If"" probability. I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK. People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.

I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government. The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government. I believe what this government is doing, is, at the very least, highly questionable and at worst, sinister. At what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the British Isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly? Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. It should be of great concern to everyone.

I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him. I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one. I think that the attack on Iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism.

How true. There are extremely worrying parallels between Britain now and Germany during the 30's. I never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within.

Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed. As a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not. That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently. Let us hope not.

Frederic Forsythe's comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole, and Britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe's opening comments suggest.

I am reminded of a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson. ""A nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither.""

The government are faced with an incredibly difficult task, and have made a policy to deal with it. It's all very well criticising that policy, but if Mr Forsythe can't draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative, I say 'So what?' to his opinions.

Frederick Forsyth's rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable. He distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against New Labour. This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.

I rarely find myself agreeing with My Forsyth, but in this instance I think he is correct. The rule of law must prevail, civil liberties are worth defending. If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?

I agree absolutely. By introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. Our democratic system is not perfect, but as Churchill points out it is ""better than all the others that have been tried"". Terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom.

I do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here. The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose. Totalitarianism always requires an outside threat, justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want. The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.

Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people. The IRA wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement.

Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views. I do not believe the government's plans are justified. There is over reaction to and the negative influence of the US President's interpretation of democracy and freedom. He uses the same arguments that were current before the WWII, the Wars to ""liberate"" Iraq, Afghanistan with Syria and Iran to come. We are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations.

Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests. Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'

Thomas Hobbes would be smiling in his grave at Labour's propositions. Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian. Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests. But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. Simply put, he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign, as protection against his fellow, barbaric, man. Hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity, and rightly so. I hope New Labour suffers the same treatment.

I agree with Mr Forsyth's views. The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy. They must not be allowed to get away with it.

Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. Has he forgotten about shoot to kill, torture, internment without trial, collusion with loyalist death squads etc?

My background is somewhat similar to Freddie's so I am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.

Whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive, it is, unfortunately, also the first step towards totalitarianism. Who is to decide whom is a suspect? Why should we believe them? Who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years? What is to stop false denunciations? What of those falsely accused who will lose their careers? Who will support their families? Will their children still go to school? It smacks to me of the methods of Nazi Germany, Stalin's Russia, Ceausescu's Romania - the list goes on. It looks as if a new dark age is coming.

I see that opinion on Mr Forsyth's remarks are divided. The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of. But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power. After all, today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! And that day, you'll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. Our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces, you have to be shown to be deserving of it. If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.

I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. We, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods. I grieve for the future of my children, it's no wonder they're adamant they don't ever want any of their own.

This government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.

Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/

I agree with Mr Forsyth. Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear. The facts turned out to be very different. If individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. We become animals too.

I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order. Mr Forsyth links ""Islamic fundamentalism"" to the new ""threat"". However it appears that he has misunderstood the term ""Islamic fundamentalism"". It should be pointed out that a Muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the Qur'aan and the teachings of the last Prophet Muhammad is an Islamic Fundamentalist. This person does not commit suicide in any shape or form, nor does she/he kill innocent women, men and children. This person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her/his actions by being good to others. The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new ""threat"" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam. They have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions. On top of that, they claim to be following Islam in its true form!

I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.

Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on. During the IRA bombings there were massive explosions in Canary Wharf, to the right of where I write this, and also to the left in the City of London. Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq. Even when England was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. We have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including ID cards, which Winston Churchill decided had to go since, he said, the average Bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally I can still remember my old ID card number). Hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered.

What can I add to Mr. Forsyth's eloquently put arguments... except applause! Well done that man for standing up and being counted in the ""war against tyranny"".

"'Super union' merger plan touted

Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a ""super union"" of two million members.

The move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that ""nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda"" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.

"UKIP MEP attacked German 'empire'

A UK Independence Party MEP suggested Germany saw the EU as an 'empire' and was cheaper than using tanks, a new documentary has revealed. Mike Nattrass, UKIP's deputy leader, made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last September's Hartlepool by-election campaign. But challenged on the remark, he denied accusing Germany of using the EU as cover for a ""4th German Reich"". He says he was not ""German-bashing"" but saying peace was the EU's founding aim. The meeting was shown in a BBC 3 film on ex-UKIP MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. The former chat show host quit the party earlier this month, calling it a joke.

The documentary showed Mr Nattrass, apparently talking about the EU, telling the meeting: ""The Germans are the big losers here but they don't care because to them the project is worthwhile. ""It's like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from Germany into Hungary, into what they call the Sudetenland - Czechoslovakia, places like that. ""So it's cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in."" On Tuesday, he told the BBC News website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with MEPs of different nationalities in the European Parliament. He argued that peace was the only reason for having the ""outdated"" EU as there was no economic justification. Pointing to Germany's trade interests as a country in the centre of Europe, Mr Nattrass said: ""The fact is that the EU benefits Germany but it does not benefit Britain. ""I'm not at all German-bashing. It's the truth."" A UKIP spokesman said: ""Mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them.""

The documentary showed some of the tensions between Mr Kilroy-Silk and his fellow MEPs after UKIP took third place in last year's European elections. He denied wanting to be leader until October 2004, when he told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme he aspired to the job. Asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions, Mr Kilroy-Silk said: ""There was one thing I said that I shouldn't have said at the time. ""I was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do, I should have told the truth."" The film also included footage of a row between Mr Kilroy-Silk, MEP Nigel Farage and party leader Roger Knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the UKIP whip in the European Parliament. Mr Kilroy-Silk told them he had not left the UKIP group - a move he announced shortly after the meeting. He told Mr Farage: ""Don't tell lies Nigel, now you've told too many. Most of the trouble had been caused by you."" UKIP officials claim it was in fact Mr Kilroy-Silk, not Mr Farage, who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of MEPs.

Later in unguarded, off-air comments in a television studio, Mr Kilroy-Silk was heard saying he was irritated by ""defending some of these right-wing fascist nutters"". Mr Kilroy-Silk separately said he had argued against UKIP working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin. A UKIP spokesman said there were more than 40 MEPs in the same group in the European Parliament. They were from a broad spectrum - some right-wing, some left-wing - but with a shared belief in the ""unfeasibility of the EU as it is now"". He did not defend other groups' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as Mr Kilroy-Silk had a right to criticise Arab states. London UKIP MEP Gerard Batten said: ""Robert has made a variety of comments about UKIP and its MEPs. ""There are of course two sides to every story. What Robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party, but not the title of leader."" Mr Kilroy-Silk is to launch his own parry, Veritas, in Westminster on Wednesday.

"Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party

Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to ""change the face of British politics"" as he launched his new party. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for ""truth"" - would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.

Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining ""an already crowded field on the right of British politics"". On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.

Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had ""gone AWOL"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. ""While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,"" he said. ""I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. ""And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.""

Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. ""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

Veritas? It's the BNP in an expensive suit!

It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in ""lies and spin"", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend. In my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-Islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.

I think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. It really is time that the UK government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. In addition as an Ashfield constituent I would be more than interested in Kilroy -Silk opposing Geoff Hoon!!

Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe. We benefit enormously from our membership of the EU, we need to be at the heart of Europe, leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go, not running away from it.

All mouth and trousers. A clown. Trouble is, any votes he collects may just end up helping New Labour into a third term.

Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England. This new party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland.

Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the USA forever!

At last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. The electorate is disillusioned with British politics. Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.

Both UKIP and RK-S are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. The interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people's bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about their petty tiff?

Many people believe you Kilroy. You may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.

The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating. One can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.

I've always thought that Kilroy-Silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.

Brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!

Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. Hopefully the UKIP members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.

Fantastic news. Pro-Europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. The Conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, European and general elections. Robert Kilroy-Silk's ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters') worst enemy.

As a euro-enthusiast I could not be more delighted by Kilroy-Silk's behaviour. He took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.

If every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long! You've got to hand it to Kilroy-Silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.

Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP. I believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the EU and to show our people what belonging to the EU really means. The EU's comments last week about Michael Howard's plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the EU and not individual member states. The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better

Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name? Is this indicative of the man - contradictory, vain and pompous?

I think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point. British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. They are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. As a result I feel our democracy is being abused and I want it stopped. If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.

Honestly, who really cares? Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.

As one of Kilroy-Silk's East Midlands constituents I hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. I feel insulted by having him represent me in the European Parliament.

UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of UKIP's democratic nature.

Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not. He tried to make it work, but they didn't seem to want to grow up. He was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy. Good luck to the man, I say.

Oh please! This is an amusing irrelevance. There is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive 'Eurosceptic' argument. They will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic Europe Union. Future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.

The refreshing thing about Robert is that he is open, honest and straight. What other politician can claim this. I have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. I shall be voting for him.

The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP. Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list. He has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the European Parliament.

I wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk. While he's a clown and a one man band at the moment, he's a populist and that's always dangerous.The man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters, that seems to be one of the factors in success.

Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.

The man I once found cringe worthy on Day time TV, could well turn out to be my country's knight in shining armour. He expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me. What's more, I look forward to the day when he claims victory, wrecks the EU, and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!

Great Stuff. The longer the UK dithers over Europe, the richer we in Ireland become, as the only English-speaking country fully committed to Europe. Oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.

This is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.

Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!

It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.

UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.

If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.

So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!

Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!

Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!

Well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here

Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.

Veritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?

"Civil servants in strike ballot

The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.

The Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.

PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.

""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented ""a formidable force"" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.

Opposition to raising the retirement age is ""one thing all the unions are agreed on"", our correspondent added. Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. There was ""some possibility"" of the strike action being avoided, he added.

"Blair Labour's longest-serving PM

Tony Blair has become the Labour Party's longest-serving prime minister.

The 51-year-old premier has marked his 2,838th day in the post, overtaking the combined length of Harold Wilson's two terms during the 1960s and 1970s. If Mr Blair wins the next election and fulfils his promise to serve a full third term, he will surpass Margaret Thatcher's 11 years by the end of 2008. In 1997, Mr Blair became the youngest premier of the 20th century, when he came to power at the age of 43. The last prime minister to be installed at a younger age was Lord Liverpool, who was a year his junior in 1812.

Mr Blair's other political firsts include becoming the first Labour leader to win two successive full terms in power after the 2001 Labour landslide. And the birth of the Blairs' fourth child, Leo, on 20 May, 2000, was the first child born to a serving prime minister in more than 150 years. The last ""Downing Street dad"" was Lord John Russell in 1848. Labour won a huge majority of 167 over the Conservatives in 2001, but Mr Blair has since been criticised by many in his own party. The war in Iraq and reforms of the health service and education system have provoked dissent from backbenchers.

Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer under Mr Blair, became Britain's longest-serving chancellor of modern times in 2004. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said the chancellor would be best placed to take over from Mr Blair. When asked about the future leadership of the party, he told ITV Wales' Waterfront programme: ""That contest is a long way away and it will occur only when the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, decides he's subscribed all he can and then wants to go. ""I think that the main contender will be Gordon Brown, who is a man of virtually unmatched capability and now great experience."" Both Mr Brown and Mr Blair rose to prominence when Lord Kinnock led Labour between 1983 and 1992.

"Tories leave door open for Archer

The Conservative Party would deal ""sympathetically"" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.

Dr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for ""vindictiveness"" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.

A jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.

He won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. ""I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. ""I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.""

Tory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. ""After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,"" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: ""I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial."" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.

"Mandelson warns BBC on Campbell

The BBC should steer away from ""demonising"" ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has said.

The European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell's campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street ""sexed up"" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.

The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard's past.

Mr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. ""What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. ""In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. ""I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. ""I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before.""

Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbell's return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of ""abusive politics"". ""The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,"" he said on Sunday. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. ""This feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might,"" she said.

"'Debate needed' on donations cap

A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.

Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.

There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.

Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.

The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.

"Conservative backing for ID cards

The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards.

The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID. The decision follows a ""tough meeting"" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC. The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.

They have said the scheme is ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. The party has been ""agnostic"" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said. Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. ""It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.""

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards. ""The Tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it."" The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.""

"Howard denies split over ID cards

Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.

The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a ""collective view"" after holding a ""good discussion"", but admitted it was ""not an easy issue"". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.

Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans ""stink"". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would ""set out the position very clearly"" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could ""help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives"". He added: ""When the police say that you have to take them seriously"".

He acknowledged there were ""good libertarian arguments"" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the ""conflicting interests"" before reaching its decision. ""I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" He also denied he was afraid of looking ""soft"" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.

Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and ""deeply flawed"". He said: ""This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.""

""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained."" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.

"Taxes must be trusted - Kennedy

Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.

A day ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to ""painful economic realities"". He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises. Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. The Lib Dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and Wednesday's speech did not announce new policies.

Speaking at the Commonwealth Club, Mr Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. He said. ""Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending."" The Lib Dems would cut ""low priority"" spending, including the government's ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund.

Those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said. The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. Now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the ""polluter who pays"".

The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises. Mr Kennedy said: ""That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. ""With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down."" He challenged the Treasury to open up its books so the National Audit Office can report on the government's performance.

Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said: Liam Fox said ""If Charles Kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments. ""The reality is, the Lib Dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year. "" And Chancellor Gordon Brown said the Lib Dem figures did not add up. He accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.

"Galloway targets 'New Labour' MP

George Galloway is to stand against pro-Iraq war Labour MP Oona King at the next general election.

Mr Galloway, who on Thursday won £150,000 in libel damages from the Daily Telegraph said he would contest Bethnal Green, in London, for Respect. The Glasgow Kelvin MP, who was expelled from Labour over his anti Iraq war stance, accused Ms King of being a ""New Labour stooge"". Ms King said she was ""delighted"" at the chance to take on Mr Galloway.

Mr Galloway's current constituency is set to disappear under planned boundary changes in Scotland.

The 50-year-old MP launched Respect, the Unity Coalition, in January along with 1,000 anti-war activists, and the Muslim Association of Britain. The party's declared aims are an end to the occupation of Iraq, the repeal of anti-union laws and the end of privatisation. Speaking from a cafe in Brick Lane, east London, Mr Galloway said he had accepted the party's invitation to stand with ""great honour and pride"".

He added: ""Here in this constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow there is a New Labour stooge MP. ""A stooge who will sing any song, make any speech, do any dance, do anything she is told to by Tony Blair - irrespective of how her constituents are adversely affected or how strongly they feel to the contrary."" Ms King has represented the constituency since 1997. She said: ""I'm delighted I've been given the chance to finish him (Mr Galloway) off, and believe me I will. ""I know many people around the country will be grateful, not least his constituents in Scotland who he has shamelessly abandoned."" In June's European Parliament elections, Respect failed to gain enough votes for an MEP but did come first in Tower Hamlets borough, most of which is covered by the Commons constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow.

A month later it gained a council seat in a by-election in St Dunstan's and Stepney Green ward, Tower Hamlets. Mr Galloway said that in next year's expected general election and local elections a year later, the party would ""turn the East End of London into a fortress"". Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for Bethnal Green and Bow from the Bangladeshi population, which makes up almost half the electorate. The Telegraph was sued for libel by Mr Galloway after the newspaper claimed he received money from Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. The newspaper said it was in the public interest to publish the claims, based on documents found in Baghdad. Mr Justice Eady said he was ""obliged to compensate Mr Galloway... and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation"".

"Election deal faltered over Heath role

The Tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 after Liberals demanded Sir Edward Heath quit in return for co-operation.

Documents released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic February general election. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government. But it partly collapsed over the Conservative leader's own role, prompting the Queen to ask Harold Wilson to form a Labour government. The February 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control. Sir Edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis, a miners' strike and the subsequent three-day week. Labour emerged with the most seats - but its 301 MPs were 17 short of the number Mr Wilson needed to form a majority.

Sir Edward, who had received more votes but had fewer MPs, believed he had the authority to remain at Number 10 providing the 14 Liberal MPs would support his government. He said the Liberals could keep out Labour in three ways: lend ad hoc support to his minority government, help draw up the government's programme, or have up to three Cabinet members in a coalition with the Conservatives. According to the documents released at the National Archives, the ""friendly and easy"" first meeting indicated that both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal. Mr Thorpe was in high spirits, having just led his party to a historic jump in support. He also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties. But Sir Edward said that was impossible because the Labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a Conservative-Liberal pact.

Hours later Sir Edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as Mr Thorpe's colleagues refused to support him. ""Jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally,"" reads a telephone memo for Mr Heath.

""They feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister. ""Asked if this was his own view he said - no it was not, I am very close to Ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult."" The following day, the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: Mr Thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and Sir Edward's resignation. Mr Thorpe told Sir Edward: ""I am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you. ""Somehow I personally hope that we can work something out.""

Four hours later, Sir Edward called the Liberal leader back to Downing Street in a last attempt at a deal. The minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated. ""The PM said he was bound to tell Mr Thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister. Mr Thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister's colleagues."" Documents show that Sir Edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a Labour-led coalition. But he already knew Mr Wilson would not form a coalition with either the Liberals or the Conservatives because of the opposition of the Labour left. Within hours of his final talks with Mr Thorpe, Sir Edward told the nation he was resigning and the Queen invited Mr Wilson to form a new minority government.

"UKIP outspent Labour on EU poll

The UK Independence Party outspent both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the European elections, new figures show.

UKIP, which campaigned on a slogan of ""Say no to Europe"", spent £2.36m on the campaign - second only to the Conservatives' £3.13m. The campaign took UKIP into third place with an extra 10 MEPs. Labour's campaign cost £1.7m, the Lib Dems' £1.19m and the Greens' £404,000, according to figures revealed by the Electoral Commission on Wednesday. Much of the UKIP funding came from Yorkshire millionaire Sir Paul Sykes, who helped bankroll the party's billboard campaign. Critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. But a UKIP spokesman said Labour and the Conservatives had spent £10m between them on the last general election. ""With the advantages of public money the others have, the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space,"" he added.

"Labour battle plan 'hides Blair'

The Tories have accused Tony Blair of being ""terrified"" of scrutiny after Labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election.

In a break with tradition, the party will ditch the leader's battle bus and daily press briefings in Westminster. Instead Mr Blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the party's message. Labour election chief Alan Milburn denied the party was trying to ""hide"" the prime minister.

He promised ""the most positive and upbeat election campaign Labour has ever run"". But Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said Labour's plans showed Mr Blair was ""terrified of facing proper scrutiny"".

""At a time when the British people are looking for more accountability and openness, this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question, 'What have they got to hide?'"" The general election is widely expected next May and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations. Mr Milburn said the economy would take centre stage in Labour's campaign in what would be a ""watershed"" election and the ""last stand of the Thatcherites"". Mr Milburn said Labour's slogan would be ""Britain is working - Don't let the Tories wreck it.""

The tone of the campaign, said Mr Milburn, would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people. The approach is particularly designed to appeal to women voters, he said. Mr Milburn brushed aside questions over why the chancellor was not present at the Cabinet meeting to discuss election strategy particularly since such importance was being given to the economy. ""I'm not privy to everybody's diary,"" he said. Mr Brown has headed Labour's preparations for previous polls but Mr Milburn is taking that role this time. In a break with the past, Labour will not hold a daily news conference in London. It will not be a ""battle bus"" style campaign either, he said.

In previous elections, each party leader has had their own battle bus transporting national newspaper, television and radio reporters to staged campaign events around the country. Mr Milburn said Labour's media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters, with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister. Mr Milburn said there would also be a greater effort to set up face-to-face meetings between ministers and the electorate. Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell is also returning to advise Labour on media strategy and campaigning.

Mr Milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether David Blunkett would have a prominent role in the election. Liberal Democrat chief executive Lord Rennard suggested Labour was avoiding news conferences in London because it wanted less scrutiny of its record and proposals. ""Tony Blair seems to have disappeared from Labour leaflets and broadcasts,"" he said. ""In contrast Charles Kennedy will feature prominently in the Liberal Democrat campaign right across the country.""

"Campbell returns to election team

Ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell will return to the fold to strengthen Labour's general election campaign, the party has confirmed.

Mr Campbell has consistently made public his keenness to play a part in the poll, expected in May. Both Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott have welcomed his return. ""He is a strong Labour Party member,"" Mr Prescott told BBC One's Breakfast With Frost programme.

Mr Campbell quit Number 10 in August 2003 after being Tony Blair's right-hand man at the 1997 and 2001 elections. Labour have refused to discuss his exact new position and have not said how it would affect his Downing Street replacement David Hill. ""Of course Alastair's going to be part of the election campaign and I think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that,"" Ms Jowell told Sky News.

But she said his return would not put anybody else's ""nose out of joint"". ""This is the daft thing about the way in which politics is written about,"" Ms Jowell added. ""There's room for everybody. We serve the country better if we make room for all the talent."" A Labour source told the Sunday Times Mr Campbell would ""effectively front"" the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title.

Labour strategists told the paper he would be ""set loose"" on Conservative leader Michael Howard in attacking his party's economic record when it was in power. ""They used pictures from the 1970s in the 1992 campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent - and now it's our turn,"" the source told the paper. ""Making Michael Howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of 15% even if it was more than a decade ago."" Mr Campbell was at the centre of the government's row with BBC over Andrew Gilligan's story about the Iraq weapons dossier. The Hutton inquiry cleared him of ""sexing up"" the dossier in the run-up to the Iraq war. Since leaving Downing Street, he has toured the country with his one man show, An Audience With Alastair Campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for Channel 4.

"Conservative MP defects to Labour

A Conservative MP and former minister has defected to Labour.

Robert Jackson, 58, MP for Wantage in Oxfordshire, said he was disillusioned with the party's leadership and its ""dangerous"" views on Europe. Prime Minister Tony Blair declared himself ""delighted"", saying Mr Jackson would be warmly welcomed by Labour MPs. Mr Jackson, who has clashed with his leaders over tuition fees and Europe in the past, served as higher education minister between 1987 and 1990. In a letter to his constituency chairman he wrote: ""It is in the country's best interest that Tony Blair rather than Michael Howard should form the next government."" While saying he admired Mr Blair's ""courageous"" leadership of the country, he bitterly criticised the Conservatives stance on Europe. ""The Conservative Party's hostility to Europe has now hardened to the point at which it advocates the unilateral denunciation of Britain's treaty obligations,"" he wrote.

Mr Blair said Mr Jackson was a ""decent, fair-minded and dedicated public servant... who will be warmly welcome by Labour MPs and members"". ""As he rightly says, [the Conservatives] have learned nothing from their two election defeats and are, if anything, drifting further rightwards,"" he added. A spokesman for Michael Howard said Mr Jackson's views on policy issues were ""very different"" from those of the party leadership. ""He believes students should pay tuition fees, that Tony Blair should not be criticised over his handling of the Iraq war and that more powers should be given to Europe,"" the spokesman said. He added that it was not surprising Mr Jackson had chosen to leave the Conservatives. Mr Jackson is due to stand down at the next election. He is the third Conservative MP to defect to Labour since 1997.

"Tory 'stalking horse' Meyer dies

Sir Anthony Meyer, the Tory backbencher who challenged Margaret Thatcher for the party leadership in 1989, has died.

He was 84, had been suffering from cancer for many months, and died at his London home. That failed ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge made it easier for Michael Heseltine to mount his own bid. That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot. Meyer's constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge. Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer was born on 27 October, 1920. Educated at Eton, and at New College, Oxford, he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy. He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament. His prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line.

"UK youth 'interested' in politics

The majority of young people are interested in politics, holding ""strong opinions"" on policies and have a ""keen appetite"" for direct action.

Research undertaken for voting watchdog the Electoral Commission suggests 81% of 16 to 20-year-olds feel strongly about issues like crime and education. The survey findings are being released to coincide with the launch of the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 initiative. Mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the UK.

Electoral Commission boss Sam Younger said: ""We know that young people often feel disengaged from democratic life and we believe in working creatively to encourage their interest and participation. ""Mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters,"" he said. The survey of a sample of 500 British 16 to 20-year-olds and 500 21 to 25-year olds ""showed Britain's young people are far from apathetic about issues that matter to most of their lives"". The Y Vote initiative is being run jointly by the Electoral Commission, the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election, possibly on 5 May. Michael Rafferty, who is mock elections project manager at the Hansard Society, said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the UK participating in the mock votes.

"MPs issued with Blackberry threat

MPs will be thrown out of the Commons if they use Blackberries in the chamber Speaker Michael Martin has ruled.

The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send e-mails. The devices gained new prominence this week after Alastair Campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a Newsnight journalist. Mr Martin revealed some MPs had been using their Blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces.

The use of electronic devices in the Commons chamber has long been frowned on. The sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the Speaker or his deputies. The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House. He or she is always an MP chosen by colleagues who, once nominated, gives up all party political allegiances.

"Talks aim to avert pension strike

Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.

Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.

The five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.""

Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

Talks aimed at averting national strikes over pension reforms have ended without agreement after 90 minutes.

Five public sector unions met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead.

"Parties warned over 'grey vote'

Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.

A survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a ""decisive blow"" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.

He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to ""support us all in an ageing society"". ""Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,"" Mr Lishman said. ""Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."" In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. Age Concern says the over-55s are ""united around"" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.

The report was welcomed by Conservative shadow pensions secretary David Willetts. ""The pensioners' voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into Blair's cool Britannia,"" he said. ""Labour's continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government."" He pointed to Tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing, strengthen company pensions and encourage savings. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously. He highlighted the party's promises to raise the basic state pension, provide free long-term care for the elderly and replace council tax, seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes. Labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to Incapacity Benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.

"Blair to face trust issue head on

Tony Blair says he will be facing the issue of trust and his own integrity head on during the election campaign.

During a question and answer session with first-time voters on Five News, Mr Blair said he had no option but to ""confront it"" by talking to people. He also dismissed claims government plans to get 50% of young people into university would devalue degrees. He was not ""forcing"" anyone to go to university, but places should be there for those who wanted them, he said. In answer to a question from 22-year-old Liverpool student David Dunne about concerns over the prime minister's personal integrity, Mr Blair said talking was the only answer. ""You've just got to confront it and say to people let's have a discussion on the things that worry you, the things that make you say 'I can't trust you' or 'I am against you on this.'"" The ""worst thing in politics"" was that the electorate only got ""little snatches of policy"" from things like Prime Minister's Questions and the news headlines. This was why he wanted to ""get out of the 30 seconds on the news,"" he added.

By talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them, even if they did not agree with them, he said. Mr Blair also faced questions about British policy on Iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme. He insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying: ""Sometimes people say because of what has happened in Iraq this is the next place."" Instead there was a real chance of a ""peaceful resolution"" to the problem, he said.

"CSA chief who 'quit' still in job

The head of the ""failing"" Child Support Agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation.

Doug Smith's departure was announced by Work Secretary Alan Johnson on 17 November as MPs grilled him over the agency's poor performance. His ""resignation"" was referred to by both Tory and Lib Dem leaders during that day's prime ministers questions. Officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules.

Mr Smith's departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the Child Support Agency. In January the MPs who make up the Commons Work and Pensions Committee published a highly critical report into the ""failing"" agency noting the chief executive ""has now left"" and hoping ""the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation"".

On that day's Today programme Mr Johnson was asked why Mr Smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked. He replied: ""The chief executive decided it was time to move on, there is a new chief executive coming in."" It now emerges that the widespread belief Mr Smith, made Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year honours, had left, was wrong. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman confirmed Mr Smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found. ""No date was ever given for Doug Smith's departure,"" she said adding that the post had been advertised.

Tory work and pensions spokesman David Willetts said families affected by CSA failings would wonder why Mr Smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced. The CSA has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.

The work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was still building up. It is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m, while a further £947m has been designated as ""unrecoverable"". The MPs found American IT giant EDS' £456m system was ""nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate"".

In November, when he surprised MPs and the watching media by announcing Mr Smith's departure, Mr Johnson said: ""I should tell you that Doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead. ""Doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post. ""So Doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins."" Lib Dem Sir Archy Kirkwood, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said that when Mr Johnson had announced Mr Smith was going he got the ""clear impression"" the CSA chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case, and he may be seeking new employment opportunities.

He added his committee was ""duty bound"" to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the CSA and it would be ""premature"" to say anything further on the issue at the moment. But committee member and Tory MP Nigel Waterson said he was ""amazed"" Mr Smith was still in his job. ""When Mr Smith and the secretary of state came to give evidence, we were led to believe he was going shortly,"" he said. ""Even if he was working out three months notice, he should have been clearing his desk by now."" Asked on Thursday about Mr Smith's position Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's World at One he thought it was a ""non-story"". He added that he had been absolutely open when he announced Mr Smith's departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a ""different thing"". ""The major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we've got the right people,"" he added.

"Blair moves to woo Jewish voters

Tony Blair has pledged to ""never, ever, ever"" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.

The prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: ""If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically."" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were ""anti-Semitic"". These were ""not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,"" Mr Blair insisted.

One poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.

Others compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: ""I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so."" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: ""The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. ""If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.""

Mr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.

Neither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone ""should have withdrawn the comment immediately"" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. ""I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it."" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.

"Parties' plans for council tax

Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.

Pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said they would rather go to jail. The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was ""fundamentally flawed"" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.

Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be ""radical reform"". The party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade. A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. An independent inquiry into its findings, the Lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005.

The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. They say they can save £4bn on ""government waste"", of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of £340. It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500. The Tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.

The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland. The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least £300m. They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a ""ceiling"" on what the richest pay. The party says it would aim for a £5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a £7,000 allowance for the over-65s. After that income would be taxed up to £100,000. The Lib Dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.

"Labour in constituency race row

Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group.

Local councillor Lyn Brown was selected for West Ham, east London, in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women. An Operation Black Vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet Labour party chairman Ian McCartney for discussions. Mr McCartney recently announced party consultation on all-black shortlists. However, Labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the West Ham result.

Ashok Vishwanathan of Operation Black Vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected. ""I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates,"" Mr Vishwanathan said.

Last month the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances. A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. ""We will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward,"" the spokesman said. Ethnic minorities make up 8% of the United Kingdom population but only 2% of MPs - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group. Twelve of them represent Labour, and one is a Liberal Democrat. If ethnic minorities were represented in the House of Commons in proportion to their numbers in the population, there would be 42 ethnic minority MPs.

"MPs tout Lords replacement plan

A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.

The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. MPs and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords. Tony Blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the Lords in Labour's manifesto.

But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a ""large majority"". And they list former Conservative leader William Hague and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock as supporters of the plans. The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber. Their plan would see the House of Lords being renamed the Second Chamber of Parliament, and its members would be known as MSCPs.

There would be 385 MSCPs, including 270 elected members, 87 appointed members and 16 bishops. They would serve for between 12 and 14 years. Mr Cook said holding elections for MSCPs on the same day as those for MPs might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. He added: ""Over the last year I have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. ""What could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our Parliament?""

The group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable. It wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a ""largely democratic"" second chamber in their manifestos. Mr Clarke said the issue ""went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system"". And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed. ""The problem, I think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him,"" he said. ""We are providing a consensus"". The Elect the Lords Campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate. ""We believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny,"" said co-ordinator Peter Facey. ""In lieu of any other such clear proposals, the government must permit that to happen.""

"Hague's six-figure earnings shown

The rewards of leaving front-bench politics are shown in the latest annual register of members' interests.

The register shows former Tory leader William Hague earning up to £820,000 on top of his MPs' salary, much of it from speaking fees. His former shadow chancellor Michael Portillo makes up to £560,000 a year - partly because of speeches and TV work. Ex-health secretary Alan Milburn earned up to £85,000 from speeches, articles and advice while not in the Cabinet.

Mr Milburn was away from the frontbench for just more than a year between stepping down as health secretary and becoming Labour's election supremo. His declared interests include £20,000 from newspaper articles and fees of up to £35,000 for four speeches. He also commanded a salary of between £25,000 and £35,000 for being on investment company Bridgepoint Capital's European advisory committee. His time out of office will, however, have lost him his £71,433 minister's salary. Mr Hague's work outside Parliament included two one-man shows, which with other speaking fees netted him up to £480,000. He also earned up to £195,000 for a weekly column in the News of the World, and between £5,000 and £10,000 for presenting BBC'2's Have I Got News for You. Mr Hague was also paid an undisclosed amount for the newspaper serialisation of his biography of William Pitt the Younger and up to £135,00 for work as an adviser to various companies.

Former Defence Secretary Michael Portillo makes some of his money as a non-executive director of BAE Systems. He is to stand down as an MP at the next election. And former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was paid between £45,001 and £50,000 for the paperback edition of his book about his resignation from government. His declared income of up to £205,000 also includes payments for being a consultant to the Tote and for his regular column in the Guardian newspaper. The register also shows former Home Office Minister Ann Widdecombe declaring a £100,000 advance for her third and fourth novels. She also received up to £30,000 for acting as the Guardian's agony aunt and between £5,001 and £10,000 for appearing on ITV's Celebrity Fit Club. David Blunkett has become a paid adviser to Indepen Consulting Limited now he is not home secretary - he helps them with seminars about the relationship between government and business. He earns between £5,001and £10,000 for the work.

Tony Blair's entry confirms that King Abdullah of Jordan paid for him to fly from a holiday in Egypt to official discussions - and for a sightseeing tour to Wadi Rum. Tory leader Michael Howard's only fresh entry is a Christmas hamper from the Sultan of Brunei. He also declares a trip to Mexico last year to address executives of News International, and helicopter and private jet travel paid for by supporters. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy registered donations to his office from supporters, a free ticket to last year's Bafta awards and rent from a single-bedroom flat in London. The register only contains new information for December 2004 - but Monday saw the publication of the annual review of the register, with the year's details. The payments are shown in bands of up £5,000, making it difficult to calculate the exact earnings.

"Schools to take part in mock poll

Record numbers of schools across the UK are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government.

Some 600 schools have already signed up for the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 run by the Hansard Society and aimed at boosting interest in politics. Pupils in the schools taking part will learn the skills of speech writers, canvassers and political candidates. Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said engaging young people's interest was ""essential"" to the future of democracy.

He added: said ""Young people who are engaged and motivated by the political process are essential to the future health of our democracy. ""The mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters. ""By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future."" The Hansard Society, the Electoral Commission and the Department for Education and Skills are running the programme. Pupils will stand as party candidates, speech writers and canvassers. Michael Raftery, project manager at the Hansard Society, said: ""The Y Vote Mock Elections for schools mirror the excitement and buzz of a real election, raising awareness of citizenship, and the benefits of active democracy."" The mock votes will take place around 5 May, widely expected to be the date of the general election. Information packs, including ballot papers and manifesto guides, with elections happening in early May were sent out to the 3,000 schools invited to take part.

"Parties build up poll war chests

The Labour Party received more than £5m in donations in the final quarter of 2004, new figures show.

This is nearly half of the £11,724,929 received by 16 political parties listed by the Electoral Commission. The Conservatives were in second place with donations totalling £4,610,849, while the Liberal Democrats received just over £1m. The majority of Labour's donations came from affiliated trade unions. There were also large sums from individuals. Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave £500,000 to the party just days before Christmas.

This followed an earlier donation of the same amount earlier in 2004. He was made a lord by Tony Blair last year. Other significant donations came from retired millionaire businessman and philanthropist Sir Christopher Ondaatje who gave the party a sum of £500,000, and refrigerator magnate William Haughey OBE who gave £330,000. The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign. The largest donation to the Conservatives was a bequest from Ruth Beardmore of nearly £400,000. The joint founder of merchant bank Hambro Magan gave £325,417. There were also donations topping £250,000 for the Conservatives from Scottish Business Groups Focus on Scotland and the Institute of International Research, the world's largest independent conference company.

Also among the gifts to the Tories were 24 donations totalling £161,840 from Bearwood Corporate Services. This company is controlled by the party's former treasurer Lord Ashcroft which has directed almost £300,000 to specific marginal constituencies over the past two years. The Liberal Democrats' largest donor was the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Ltd, a company which promotes political reform and constitutional change, which gave a sum of £250,000. And fast food giants McDonald's are listed as donating a sum of £10,575. This was a fee the firm paid for a room for an event held with the work and skills foundation during the party's conference. The UK Independence Party, which lost its main donor Paul Sykes amid the row over Robert Kilroy-Silk's bid for the leadership last autumn, took in £63,081. Just £8,170 of this was cash and the remainder came in gifts in kind, such as office space and printing. Registered political parties are required to set out each quarter all donations over £5,000 to their headquarters and over £1,000 to local constituency parties they receive. It is an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly make a false declaration about party donations.

"Kennedy predicts bigger turnout

Voters' ""pent up passion"" could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election, Charles Kennedy has said.

The Liberal Democrat leader predicted concerns over Iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign. His comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts. Ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of ""pager politics"" and not being heard. He, like Mr Kennedy, pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the Iraq war.

Mr Cook, who is giving evidence to the Power inquiry into voter turnout rates, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme it was not fair to blame the public who were ""more interested in politics than ever before"". ""They are turned off by the way we do politics in Britain. There's a message there for politicians."" He urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to ""speak more from the heart"". ""We should be not so afraid to say what we stand for."" He also criticised the cult of personality politics: ""There's far too much interest in celebrities. ""Politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry."" The government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001. This has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting.

"Iraq advice claim sparks new row

The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.

Downing Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not ""leaned on"" in any way. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.

The government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.

But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. It said it was ""plain"" Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441. In his new book, Lawless World, Philippe Sands, a QC and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in Downing Street. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.

Mr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. On 10 March, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. ""After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,"" said Mr Sands.

Tory leader Michael Howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General, warning: ""This issue will not go away."" ""These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. ""The government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust."" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public. ""The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.""

In a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: ""In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. ""It was certainly not a view that I expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way, nor as I have already made clear, was it written by or at Number 10."" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: ""The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his."" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an ""independent legal opinion"", not subject to ""political negotiation of this kind"".

"UKIP could sue Veritas defectors

The UK Independence Party could take legal action to unseat two London Assembly members who defected to Robert Kilroy Silk's Veritas Party.

Damian Hockney, now Veritas deputy leader, and Peter Hulme-Cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. The party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as UKIP representatives, not as individuals. Mr Hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. UKIP chairman Petrina Holdsworth urged the men to step down from the GLA in a letter.

She said: ""The party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you. ""We would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done, to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election."" Mr Hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the GLA as it did for other electoral list systems. ""The Greater London Act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party."" He said Mr Hulme-Cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was UKIP who were not being true to the electorate. He accused the party of signing up to a deal with the Tories in Europe, rather than sticking to an independent stance. But the claim was denied by UKIP spokesman, who said: ""Mr Hockney's accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty."" Veritas was formed by Mr Kilroy-Silk earlier this month after he quit UKIP following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.

"Prime minister's questions

So who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation?

Michael Howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, he claims, is ""ramming"" through Parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. He didn't say so, but the Tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election And they believe Tony Blair is using the issue to suggest the Tories are soft on terrorism. Why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the Tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws, he demanded. The prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. Is not the opposition against to the proposed laws ""in principle"", in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless?

What this is really about, believes Mr Blair, is the Tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass, maybe even defeat the government. And that is more important to them than national security. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. He preferred to state that, as with other issues like ID cards, the government's immediate instinct was authoritarian.

As is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Mr Kennedy than he had been with Mr Howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point. Apart from all that, it was electioneering as usual. The very first question to the prime minister from Derby North's Bob Laxton asked him, in effect, if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. Later Birmingham's Sion Simon even went so far as to suggest the Tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. The prime minister almost blushed. This was not the appropriate place to announce election day, he stammered. But can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 April for an election on 5 May is where the big money is in the Commons. And perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment.

"Goldsmith denies war advice claim

The attorney general has denied his statement to Parliament about the legality of the Iraq war was drafted by Downing Street officials.

Lord Goldsmith said Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan played no part in drafting the answer. He added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the PM. The government has resisted calls to publish the full advice, saying such papers are always kept confidential.

In a statement, Lord Goldsmith said: ""I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer."" He said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his own officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg.

""No other minister or official was involved in any way."" He suggested the claim that Lord Falconer and Lady Morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the Butler Inquiry into pre-war intelligence. ""As I have always made clear, I set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (UN) Security Council resolutions,"" he said. ""The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government."" Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled. ""The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,"" he said. ""What is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full, accurate summary of his formal opinion.""

Earlier, Tony Blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his Parliamentary statement had been a ""fair summary"" of his opinion. ""That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say. He has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue.

On the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, Tory MP Michael Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry, told the BBC: ""That, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule."" He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charles's marriage plans. The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said. Mr Mates added: ""This may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.""

The claims about Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan's involvement were made in a book published this week by Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers. He also says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.

A short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. She said the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code, and demanded a Lords inquiry into the matter. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General. Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said Lord Goldsmith's statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues. ""If his original advice of 7 March accepted that military action might be illegal, how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the Parliamentary answer was published on 17 March?"" he said. ""Only the fullest disclosure will now do.""

"Goldsmith: 'I was not leant on'

The attorney general has again denied being ""leant on"" by Downing Street to make the legal case for invading Iraq.

Claims a written answer on the legality of the war was drafted by Downing Street were ""wholly unfounded,"" he insisted during stormy Lords exchanges. Lord Goldsmith said the answer represented his ""genuinely held independent view"" the war was legal. The text was released on the eve of a crucial Commons vote in which MPs backed the invasion of Iraq. Many Labour MPs have since indicated that the attorney general's answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict. The government has resisted calls to publish the full advice, saying such papers are always kept confidential. In the House of Lords, the attorney general faced a call by former Tory lord chancellor Lord Mackay to now publish the ""full text"" of the advice - the suggestion was rejected. Another peer meanwhile, Lord Skidelsky, said not to publish the full legal opinion would ""strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption, in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction"".

Last week Lord Goldsmith said in a statement: ""I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer."" He said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his own officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg.

But Mr Crosby said in a statement: ""I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view."" Mr Howard later added there was not ""one iota"" of truth in the report.

"Manchester wins Labour conference

The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.

The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.

For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.

Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: ""We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. ""Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. ""It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country."" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.

"Labour attacked on Howard poster

Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.

The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: ""I can spend the same money twice."" The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory. Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: ""2+2=5"".

The hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver! There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members. It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday. Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about ""personalised abusive campaigning"". Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: ""It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches.""

Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. ""Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""Whatever the idea is, I think it's a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning."" Mr Temko said he blamed ""cock-up not conspiracy"", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.

The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued. ""Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme... is that the Tories are trying to con you."" A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. ""This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,"" he said. But a Conservative spokeswoman said: ""This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour's campaign team.""

"Milburn defends poster campaign

Labour's election chief Alan Milburn has defended his party's campaign posters amid Tory claims the ads were nothing short of ""sly anti-Semitism"".

Mr Milburn said he appreciated people's concerns, but insisted that ""what they were was anti-Tory"" and ""not in any way, shape or form anti-Semitic"". He was responding to Tory spokesman Julian Lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.

A row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti-Semitic. The posters were labelled a ""big misjudgement"" by the Conservatives who said Labour's ""first shot in the election has badly backfired"".

The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who were asked to vote on their favourite. Labour has taken them off its website, saying members preferred other posters. The party's four new designs, launched on Tuesday, steer clear of the Fagin or flying pig images, but make clear that Labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the Tory leader personally, with reminders of his record in office.

The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour chairman Ian McCartney last year described shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin as a ""21st Century Fagin"".

""Given the outrage that that smear caused then, how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-Semitism?"" Mr Milburn replied that they were not anti-Semitic. ""What they were was anti-Tory and I make no apologies at all for making clear to the British public exactly what the Conservative plans would mean,"" he said. ""I fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the Labour Party website."" The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labour's website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5. A Labour spokesman later said their removal from the party's website was not affected by the row.

"Kilroy names election seat target

Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.

Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record ""as a hard-working constituency MP"". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to ""change the face"" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.

On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". He said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration and promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.

UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining ""an already crowded field on the right of British politics"". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.

UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had ""gone AWOL"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. ""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

"Immigration to be election issue

Immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.

But no longer. Both Labour and the Tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns. They have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues, with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes. That was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue. But it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or, alternatively, running scared of addressing the problem. But this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies.

The Tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration, with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the UK. Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.

Now Home Secretary Charles Clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry, and to kick out more failed asylum seekers. That has been attacked by the Tories as too little, too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the UK. The Liberal Democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a Europe-wide policy on immigration.

But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before. Former union leader Sir Bill Morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a ""bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers"".

""My concern is that, whilst the Labour Party and the Conservative Party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right-wing political parties, picking up on statements like `burden to Britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty"". It is precisely that concern - and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right's racist agenda - that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue. The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.

"Kennedy begins pre-election tour

Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the ""real opposition"".

Mr Kennedy is visiting constituencies in Somerset and Hampshire on Monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives. Later he will visit places, such as Liverpool, where Labour is targeted. Labour say a Lib Dem vote could ""let the Tories in"", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean ""higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe"". Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May. On Tuesday Mr Kennedy will visit Leicester South, where Lib Dem MP Parmjit Singh Gill overturned a big Labour majority to win the seat in last year's by-election.

Stops in Shrewsbury, North Dorset, Liverpool, Manchester, Basingstoke and west London are planned for later in the week. The Liberal Democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and Labour, while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the Tories. Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in ""recent experience"". Asked whether it was realistic to assume the Liberal Democrats could win the general election, he said: ""There's no limit to the ambitions we have as a party. ""But we have got to be responsible, we have got to be credible, we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task.""

Mr Kennedy said the British public felt let down by Labour on issues from Iraq to top-up fees and the Conservatives were not ""asking the critical questions"". And he said people were ""highly sceptical"" about Labour and Conservative promises on tax. But he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in ""by the back door"". ""If you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the Conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government. ""That's going to be the story, I think, of this coming general election.""

"Labour's core support takes stock

Tony Blair has told Labour supporters he's ""back"" and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but does that sum up the mood at the party's spring conference in Gateshead?

""The electorate are keener on the government than some Labour Party members,"" is the dry assessment of Graham Lane, leader of the Labour group on Newham Council. The problem, according to Mr Lane, is not continuing divisions over Iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but Mr Blair himself. ""I have a new slogan. Vote Blair, Get Brown. That's what I am telling people on the doorstep. Don't worry, he will be gone soon."" His friend, Saxon Spence, leader of Devon county Labour group, lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others. ""You cannot underestimate the impact of the war in Iraq. We lost people from our local party who had some key roles.""

But the two friends were fired up by Gordon Brown's speech on Saturday, with its appeal to core Labour values on social justice, health and education.

""There was real passion. I think we have all felt a little jaded, but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place,"" said Mrs Spence. ""If he hadn't have walked off the stage, they would still be clapping,"" added Mr Lane. But for every Brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of Mr Blair. Stephen Douglas, 26, from Wales, said after the PM's speech on Sunday: ""I think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues. The guy still has it.""

Tony Martin, of Burnley, said: ""He is the first leader who has won us two terms. This bloke has delivered for us."" Malcolm Shipley, of Shipley, said it was ""as if he is coming round to the right approach again"". Katrina Bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said Mr Blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots: ""I think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with Tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout."" She had just emerged from a Q&A session, in which Mr Blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered questions posed via the party's website.

A party of councillors from Nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with Mr Blair's leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever. Iraq, they insisted, would not be a factor for most voters. ""The biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election. ""It might sound great, but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and I think that is the greater problem than Iraq,"" said Nottingham City Councillor Brian Parbutt. And even Mr Blair's most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy, high-profile campaigning that has become Labour's hallmark, epitomised by Friday's whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. A group of shop stewards from the Swan Hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at Mr Blair's failure to, as they saw it, shake off his Tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the North East.

They were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue Sage Centre, heralded by John Prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of Labour's success in urban regeneration.

""It is no good having the Sage or Baltic if you haven't got the money for the entrance fee,"" said Terry Telford. But when asked about Mr Blair's bravura performance on Friday, the men agreed he was ""brilliant"". And they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the Labour message come election time. ""If you are not fired up about the election, then what's the point? There is no complacency as far as I can see in the Labour Party. We are fired up. We are up for this election,"" said Richie Porterhouse. Mr Telford agreed, but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked ""What has Labour done for the North East?"" ""I have had doors slammed in my face,"" he said.

Every activist I spoke to said they were proud of what they believed Labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools, the better life chances for young people. The problem they faced, they said, was converting this local feelgood factor into votes. But they could at least rely on one ""secret weapon"", as one activist put it - Tory leader Michael Howard.

"Campaign 'cold calls' questioned

Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing ""cold calls"".

The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. The information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.

But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.

The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for ""voter identification"" calls. ""When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,"" he said. ""So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.""

He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: ""We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law."" Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But ""classic market research"", such as a poll of voter intentions, did not constitute direct marketing, he said. ""If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned,"" said Mr Jones. ""If a party rings a person who is registered on TPS to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations. ""In summary, whether a party calling TPS registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed."" Mr Jones said the watchdog received ""very few complaints"" on the issue.

Earlier, Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: ""The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are ""significant"" numbers of such calls. ""I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,"" he tells the commissioner. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.

"Lib Dems highlight problem debt

People vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products, the Lib Dems say.

Vincent Cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. The Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. He wants to see ""proper health checks"" when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.

""Were economic conditions to deteriorate at all, large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit,"" Mr Cable told BBC News. ""Banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead."" Mr Cable said the government's Consumer Credit Bill would target some of the ""extreme problems"" such as loan sharking, but ministers had been ""a bit complacent"" about the wider issue of debt levels. He said much of the payment protection currently available was ""extremely expensive"" and there were ""lots of exclusions"".

Mr Cable added that the Office of Fair Trading should investigate the market. Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the UK aimed at persuading voters his is the ""real opposition"". Mr Kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats, where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives, and urban areas traditionally associated with Labour. Labour say a Lib Dem vote could ""let the Tories in"", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean ""higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe"". Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May.

"Lib Dems target first-time buyers

The Liberal Democrats have unveiled plans to build 100,000 new ""affordable"" homes on publicly owned land.

The party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder. The Lib Dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites. Labour has already announced plans to help first-time buyers and the Tories would extend right-to-buy schemes.

All the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of UK towns. The Lib Dems say their ""mutual homes"" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs. Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government. People would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land, he added.

They would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property. When they moved house, they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share. It would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account. Mr Kennedy said: ""Mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually, investing only as much as they can afford.""

There are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities. The kind of ""golden share"" used by the Lib Dems in South Shropshire could be rolled out more widely. Under the plan, councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1% share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market. Instead, they are sold at ""build cost"" to people who the local council decides have local needs. The party says its help for first-time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer. But the plans involve changing the VAT system, which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings.

The Conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to £11,000 on every new house. ""This is typical of Lib Dem hypocrisy,"" said Tory shadow local government secretary Caroline Spelman. ""They claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder, but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market."" The flagship Tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes. Labour has said it will allow 300,000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes. Housing Minister Keith Hill said much of the Lib Dem plans mimicked the government's strategy. ""However, as usual, the Lib Dems' proposals are completely uncosted,"" he said. Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend £42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.

"Lib Dems unveil women's manifesto

The Liberal Democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women.

Charles Kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments. He also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. Both Labour and the Conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support. Mr Kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women. ""Two million pensioners in Britain currently live below the government's own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women,"" he said.

He says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. The Lib Dem's Citizen's Pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, Mr Kennedy argues. Under the package, new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of £170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. Mr Kennedy also believes the party's plans to use the money saved from not introducing ""illiberal"" ID cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too. The policies are not new announcements, but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.

Mr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party's candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women. Party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by 4%. Mr Kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour on Monday. During the interview Mr Kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party's general election campaign around the birth of his first child, which is expected in April. The baby and his wife Sarah would be ""priority number one"" even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign, he said.

Party strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success. A party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and open-minded in deciding who they vote for. Labour's deputy minister for women Jacqui Smith accused the Lib Dems of offering ""false promises"" to women and said their sums did not add up. She said: ""These proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year, and hard working families will pay dearly, through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services"". The Labour party has committed itself to ""universal, affordable and flexible"" childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds, including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm. In September, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if Labour won a third term. The Conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in November they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like, on a nanny, au pair or even a family member, such as a grandparent, acting as a carer. They were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.

"Kennedy questions trust of Blair

Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a ""fundamental lack of trust"" of Tony Blair as prime minister.

He said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the Lib Dems ""what you see is what you get"". He made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on Channel Five in a session on The Wright Stuff programme. Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.

Mr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. ""1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,"" he said. ""We don't actually hear the argument any longer: 'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. ""You don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote."" But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people. ""There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,"" he said.

""What we've got to do as a party - what I've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get."" Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. Mr Blair has already spent a day with Five and Michael Howard is booked for a similar session.

"Brown outlines third term vision

Gordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labour's next general election bid.

He said ensuring every child in Britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the NHS's creation. The chancellor has previously planned the party's election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn - a key ally of Tony Blair. The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.

Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. ""As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities."" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was ""a warning shot"" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. ""It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,"" was Mr Marr's assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be ""central"". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was ""in part"" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy. And he pledged childcare would be a ""centrepiece"" of Labour's manifesto. He also predicted the next general election will be a ""tough, tough fight"" for New Labour. But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May. Mr Blair said he was taking ""nothing for granted"" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

"Labour's Cunningham to stand down

Veteran Labour MP and former Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election.

One of the few Blair-era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997. Mr Cunningham went on to become Tony Blair's ""cabinet enforcer"". He has represented the constituency now known as Copeland since 1970. Mr Blair said he was a ""huge figure"" in Labour and a ""valued, personal friend"".

During Labour's long period in opposition, Mr Cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs, the environment and as trade spokesman. As agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over BSE. He quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all-party committee on Lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches.

"Will Tory tax cuts lift spirits?

Michael Howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned Tory tax cuts.

Should he win the next general election, he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. This was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to. At its simplest, it is saying: ""Vote Tory and you can have it both ways"". Not only would his government stick to Labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions. And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.

All the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service. Of that, £23 billion would go on spending plans, with £8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.

Neither Mr Howard nor Mr Letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash, although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. Ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the Tory party are urging Mr Howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. As the Tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between Labour and the Tories. ""At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,"" he said.

It is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.

The extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters. And that is where one of the problems lies for Mr Howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services AND lower taxes? He insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into Downing Street. Labour, needless to say, claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply don't add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.

One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy. So far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third New Labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. And, while other issues like the Iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.

"Teenagers to be allowed to be MPs

Teenagers will be able to become MPs under plans unveiled by ministers.

In a written statement, Constitutional Affairs Minister Christopher Leslie said the current minimum age of 21 for an MP would be reduced to 18. The proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the Electoral Commission. ""The government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age,"" said Mr Leslie, who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24. Even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election, widely predicted for May.

The announcement from Mr Leslie - who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe Tory seat - prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16. The Votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to ""engage people"" by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective. ""Candidacy affects only politicians. The voting age affects millions of younger people,"" said spokesman Alex Folkes. ""We would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age.""

Currently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18. That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. Irish republican Bernadette Devlin was one of just a handful of 21-year-olds elected to Parliament in the 20th century winning a seat in 1969. But the youngest is understood to have been Tory Edward Turnour, who won the 1904 Horsham by-election aged 21 and 144 days and served in Parliament for 47 continuous years. Last April's report by the Electoral Commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21. The commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age.

"Labour's four little words

Labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which, for those just returned from the planet Galifray, is ""looming"".

The slogan ""Britain forward not back"" (no, it's not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary Time Lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it's always there but we mostly stop noticing. The word ""Britain"" is cast on a red background - a nod to Old Labour. ""Forward"" is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and, along with ""not back"", is set against a mushy pea green background. As one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared, it was all very post modern, or something. Great use of colour. Those ad men really do earn their money. And, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called ""Fagin"" posters which caused Tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo Alan Milburn declared, ""are doing a very good job"".

Mr Milburn, in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe Labour and Tony Blair are the future while Michael Howard and the Tories would take the country backwards. ""Not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days,"" he declared. It would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between Labour and the Tories.

Nobody, he claimed, could picture Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy walking up Downing Street the day after polling. They could, however, picture Michael Howard or, of course, Tony Blair doing it. So it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition's policies and past record. And Tony Blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said. ""Between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of London than in it but in Britain, not overseas,"" he promised. ""He will be leading the domestic debate from the front, listening, taking the flak."" So, let's get on with it then.

"Tories outlining policing plans

Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.

Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised ""extravagant"" Tory promises on policing.

Responding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.

Jan Berry said: ""It is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""These plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned. Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. ""The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are."" Mr Howard said the authorities were not ""providing the local accountability that we want to see"" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.

Critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. ""That is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions,"" he said.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and ""could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials"". Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a ""minimum policing guarantee"" with their chief constables. A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. He said: ""Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system."" The Tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an American sheriff. Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.

"TV debate urged for party chiefs

Broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders, according to the Hansard Society.

It would then be up to Tony Blair, Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy to decide whether to take part, the non-partisan charity said. Chairman Lord Holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter ""of public interest"". ""The broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead,"" he said.

Lord Holme's proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch US President George W Bush slug it out verbally with his Democratic challenger John Kerry. He said it was a ""democratically dubious proposition"" that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here.

If Mr Blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, Lord Holme said. ""What makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although Mr Howard and Mr Kennedy have said they would welcome a debate, no-one has heard directly from the prime minister,"" he said. ""It has been left to nudges and winks, hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that Mr Blair doesn't want one, but we haven't heard from the prime minister himself.""

Lord Holme, who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections, said broadcasters were ""more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements"". Opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes, he said.

Lord Holme argued that as part of their public service obligations, broadcasters ""should make the decision to go ahead"" as soon as the election is called. An independent third-party body such as the Hansard Society or Electoral Commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public, he said. ""It would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse,"" said Lord Holme.

""If the prime minister's reported position is true and he does want to take part, he would then be obliged to say why publicly. ""The broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons, or going ahead with an empty chair. ""Either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto."" The Hansard Society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. Tony Blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. Last month he said: ""We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no,"" he said at his monthly news conference.""

"Chancellor rallies Labour voters

Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.

The chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts. He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win. The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.

To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: ""I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. ""Never again Tory boom and bust.

""This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more."" Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.

He also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. ""My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,"" he said. ""And the next Labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative."" In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.

He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: ""This was more talk from Gordon Brown. ""We've heard it all before. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. ""He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. ""There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.""

Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it. ""For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,"" he said. ""Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. ""For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation."" Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done. He also said he wanted to carry on as PM ""because I still think that there are big changes our country needs"".

"Brown 'proud of economy record'

Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election.

The chancellor said he was proud of his party's record on the economy, and would strive for continuing stability if elected. The Gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. And the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. Later, Prime Minister Tony Blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.

Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw ""sharp dividing lines"" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. He would contrast Labour's plan to invest £60bn in services with a Tory plan to cut spending by £35bn. ""Mr Brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the Asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade,"" our correspondent said.

On Friday night, Mr Brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the Labour manifesto had been published after the Budget, expected in March. But commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether, as the Conservatives claim, he plans to raise tax after the election. The Tories accuse Labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.

Following the chancellor's keynote speech, the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on Saturday. Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election. Capital Radio DJ Margherita Taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. The prime minister's enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed, Alan Milburn, Labour's election strategist told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. Mr Blair has ""the same passion and the same commitments for the job"" as when Labour came to power in 1997, he said.

And he confirmed Mr Blair's insistence that no poll date had yet been set. He said: ""I'm the General Election co-ordinator and I don't know, and Tony has not made up his mind."" On Friday, the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of England, during which he unveiled his party's six pre-election pledges. Starting in London, he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were Labour's achievements on the economy, crime, education and public services. The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour's election campaign - were ""worthless"".

"Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies'

Tony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories.

Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a ""hard right agenda"". Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.

The prime minister ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.

In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: ""I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street."" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and ""throwing crockery"". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: ""It's a fight for the future of our country, it's a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.""

Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in ""a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward"". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies. ""What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,"" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. ""We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,"" he said, insisting he enjoyed a ""warm and constructive"" relationship to Lord Ashcroft.

Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay. He said: ""This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. ""In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales."" The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a ""touchy-feely"" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.

"Blair joins school sailing trip

The prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his party's education policies.

Tony Blair sailed across the lake in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, while on a visit with Education Secretary Ruth Kelly to back school outings. Mr Blair later stressed Labour's election pledge to focus on education, when he met parents in the area. The Conservatives and Lib Dems both say his pledges are ""worthless"". All the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a General Election widely expected to be held on 5 May. Mr Blair, looking a little windswept, joined two girls from St Egwin's Middle School in Evesham and an instructor for a trip in the Wayfarer dinghy, closely followed by a boat full of photographers.

Afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong. ""What we're doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action,"" Mr Blair said. ""When you are doing these types of activities you've got to exercise some common sense there obviously. ""You can't have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they're going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character.""

The pledge on education - ""your child achieving more"" - was one of six election pledges unveiled by Mr Blair last week. If it wins a third term in the general election expected this year, Labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools; allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status; opening 200 city academies and creating 100,000 more sixth-form places. It aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a ""zero tolerance"" approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants. Labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils.

Parents and teachers who met Mr Blair on Tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their MPs to raise concerns about education. It is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run-up to the election - and that he has not lost touch. For the Conservatives, shadow education secretary Tim Collins said: ""Mr Blair&#191;s government is all talk. He must be judged on what he has done in two terms, not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third. That judgment will be damning."" The Liberal Democrats are promising to cut class sizes for the youngest children and ensure all children are taught by a qualified teacher in each subject.

"Analysis: No pain, no gain?

He called it his ""masochism strategy"" in the run-up to the Iraq war and now Tony Blair has signed up for another dose of pain.

The idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of ""real"" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. The theory is that talking to the great British public, even if they are the ""great unwashed"", is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. It is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people's concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. Mr Blair used the tactic before the Iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.

Labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin, ""control freakery"" and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own MPs. Tony Blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. Mr Blair's latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on Five television throughout Wednesday.

The trouble began on the Wright Stuff show, with Maria Hutchings marching up to him, saying ""Tony, that's rubbish"" as she tried to complain about her autistic son's school being threatened with closure. A few ""don't worries"" as Mrs Hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. But that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce.

Writer Neil Coppendale, from West Sussex, asked of the Iraq war: ""Tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night?"" On immigration, London teacher Diane Granger said: ""Where are you going to put everyone?"" And can you imagine even Jeremy Paxman putting the question posed by Brighton nurse Marion Brown: ""Would you wipe somebody's backside for £5?""

Mr Blair tried to use the questioners' first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. Many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a PR stunt which backfired. Indeed there is a danger Mr Blair simply ends up looking ""embattled"". Conservative Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. Labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence.

James Humphreys, ex-head of corporate communications at Number 10, says the strategy shows frustration with the media. ""They feel they don't get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion,"" he says. There are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls, he argues. The prime minister knows full well the potential hazards .

He must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with Sharron Storer, the Birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign. ""All you do is walk around and make yourself known, you don't do anything to help anybody,"" she told Mr Blair before stomping off, refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell has described the episode as a ""bit of a disaster"" as it meant the launch of Labour's election manifesto received little coverage. But it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive, not least because it coincided with John Prescott's even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.

Former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. The undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was Margaret Thatcher discomfort on Nationwide in 1983, when viewer Diana Gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the Belgrano in the Falklands War. John Major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox.

It may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added ""fizz"" to his campaign. In his memoirs, he also argues the strategy contrasted with Neil Kinnock's ""contrived photo opportunities"" and attempts at an artful campaign. ""He wanted to look like a prime minister. I

was

prime minister and I wanted a flesh and blood fight,"" says Mr Major. Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could ""enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment"". But he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: ""Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day."" His hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for Labour the old maxim: ""No pain, no gain.""

"Brown names 16 March for Budget

Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.

The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at about 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. The Tories say it is likely the Budget will contain measures to attract votes. The election is expected on 5 May.

Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's ninth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue.

The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""We can be sure of two things: the Budget will contain measures to attract votes, and it will not contain the £8 billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if Labour wins the election."" As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. ""In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,"" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.

"Lib Dems stress Budget trust gap

Public trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if Gordon Brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection, say the Lib Dems.

City experts say there is a £10bn ""black hole"" in the public finances, a claim denied by the chancellor. Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable said the public did not know who to believe and the National Audit Office should judge. Responding to the pre-Budget report, Mr Cable also attacked Labour's ""unfair"" and over-complicated taxes.

In his report, Mr Brown insisted he was on course to meet his ""golden rule"" of borrowing only to invest, rather than for day-to-day spending, over the course of the economic cycle. Mr Cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken. ""There is an issue of credibility and trust,"" he said. ""We cannot have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them. ""What we need is the equivalent of a thorough Ofsted inspection of the government's accounts."" He asked what the government had to hide.

Mr Cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices. He argued: ""There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted."" Mr Brown confirmed he was setting aside another £520m for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Cable compared that new cost with the £500m needed for Britain's role in the entire first Gulf War - when 80% of the bill had been met through help from European and Arab nations. He suggested keeping British troops in Iraq could cost another £1bn with the government also planning to spend at least £3bn for identity cards. The current economic climate meant Britain could not afford the ""reckless, George Bush-style tax cutting spree"" planned by the Tories, he said. Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the ""complete mess"" produced by Mr Brown's endless tinkering.

Mr Cable said 40% of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of 50%. And one-and-a-half million hard working families were paying 60% marginal tax rates. With that record, he asked why ministers attacked Lib Dem plans for a new 50% tax rate for the ""very rich"" - those earning more than £100,000 a year. Mr Brown earmarked £1bn to help keep down council tax rises next year. But the Lib Dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health. He urged the government to scrap the ""grossly unfair"" tax completely. The Lib Dems want it replaced with a local income tax. In response, Mr Brown stressed the Iraq money came from a reserve funds. It was because he had rejected previous Lib Dem proposals, such as scrapping the New Deal, that Britain's economy was successful, claimed Mr Brown.

"Blair backs 'pre-election budget'

Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.

In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.

""That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of Labour's programme.

In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"".

""In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: ""He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We're not so sure."" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: ""His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic. ""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.""

Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. ""In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election."" Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using ""fancy statistics"" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his ""golden rule"". ""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Mr Cable told MPs.

"Cabinet anger at Brown cash raid

Ministers are unhappy about plans to use Whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down, local government minister Nick Raynsford has acknowledged.

Gordon Brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-Budget report on Thursday. Mr Raynsford said he had held some ""pretty frank discussions"" with fellow ministers over the plans. But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.

The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in England keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year.

Mr Raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities. And he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues. ""Obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. But he said there was a recognition that ""a good settlement for local government"" was important to health, education and ""other government departments"". Ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without ""unreasonable council tax increases"", he added. Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.

""This is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face."" Mr Raynsford also plans to make savings of £100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes. These would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early. He insisted the changes were ""very modest"" and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring ""very early"". But general secretary of the public services union Unison Dave Prentis criticised the plans. ""If you want world class public services you don't get that by hitting people as they approach retirement.""

"'UK will stand firm on EU rebate'

Britain's £3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said.

The foreign secretary told MPs the rebate, secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, was ""entirely justified"". New European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the EU budget. Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to ""see the light"" on the rebate.

But the foreign secretary told the Commons foreign affairs committee: ""Our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation."" He added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the UK's stance - Britain contributed more and received less than other EU states. The two-day European Council summit in Brussels begins on 16 December and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the EU's budget for 2007-13. The wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006.

The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the Commission wants it to be 1.26%. Mr Straw said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. ""I don't know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount,"" he added. The foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with Turkey about possible EU membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.

"Brown ally rejects Budget spree

Chancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.

Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.

Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - ""with a margin to spare"". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.

He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. ""If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,"" he told a Parliamentary lunch. ""This is a big change in our political culture.""

During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. ""I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,"" he said.

His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: ""Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering."" Sir Digby added: ""I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. ""We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. ""That would be a good way to spend any excess.""

Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. ""I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,"" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.

"Will the Budget bring out smiling voters?

As Tory spokesman Oliver Letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldn't he.

And everyone does, indeed, expect Gordon Brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 May. There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters' faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election. And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week's Budget. The aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core Labour voters in the fold, while ensuring the middle England voters who gave Tony Blair two election victories don't desert him at the third poll.

And, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Brown's own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. But there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts. That is the size of the financial ""black hole"" the Tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe Mr Brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.

The opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a Treasury leak suggested Mr Brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. It was immediately denied, but the Tories remain suspicious, claiming that, as Mr Letwin said, if the money does not come from there, where will it come from.

Mr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should Labour win. Previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can Britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending. The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.

The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. And there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in Whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. And it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.

"Budget to set scene for election

Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.

Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.

- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 
 - A freeze on petrol duty 
 - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families 
 - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.

The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a ""classic Labour stealth tax"". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: ""Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,"" he said. ""If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.""

But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: ""I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.""

For the Lib Dems David Laws said: ""The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,"" he said. ""But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way."" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.

"Brown comes out shooting

Labour may have abolished hunting - but that didn't stop Chancellor Gordon Brown using his Budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties' core election foxes.

Specifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families. In a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting. So if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from Mr Brown's red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a New Labour government. Like a surgeon, he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign.

The announcements brought great cheers from his own MPs who are now in full-on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps. They obviously believed he had done that for them and, coincidentally, given his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost.

Labour MPs, for example, will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely Old Labour word - this chancellor really is. But Gordon Brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win Labour an historic third term, his demeanour remained quiet, confident and reassuring. Prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to Britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else. According to the opposition parties, however, it is all one big con trick.

As always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the ""black hole"" at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election. He did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax. As Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy claimed, for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless.

Tory leader Michael Howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the Treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use. He branded it a dodgy ""vote now pay later"" budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave Britain the dodgy dossier. Where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering, Mr Howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing Mr Brown's forecasts to the prime minister's forecasts on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. As ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties' treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor's red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws. In particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal. And in Labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister Gordon Brown will make at some point after the next election.

"Kennedy criticises 'unfair' taxes

Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the ""fundamental unfairness"" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.

How was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the Lib Dem leader asked. The new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the ""unfair tax"", he added. The government could not go on ""patching up"" the system, he added. Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.

But he criticised both the chancellor and the Tories for failing to address the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation. He said the recent experience of Wales indicated seven million households in England would pay significantly more after revaluation. The chancellor's announcement that he was to offer a £200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a ""sticking plaster"" to a much bigger problem. The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.

On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a ""scandal"" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children. He said a residency criteria would end ""at a stroke this fundamental iniquity"". Mr Kennedy added his party's priorities of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100,000 per annum. He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax. The chancellor went on to put up National Insurance contributions after the election. ""For most individuals, most families, most households, it adds up to exactly the same thing,"" said Mr Kennedy. ""And they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.""

"Howard attacks 'pay later' Budget

Tory leader Michael Howard has dismissed Gordon Brown's Budget as ""vote now, pay later"" spending plans.

The simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said. Everyone could see the chancellor's ""sweeteners"", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said. Labour's ""faltering election campaign"" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added.

Mr Brown's Budget was not about what was good for the country, but ""all about the interests of the Labour party,"" the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. He went on to accuse Mr Brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. He urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging ""millions of people in to the net"" to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax. ""We can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if Labour wins.""

He also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems Britain faced. ""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" Mr Brown liked to rattle off ""magical balances conjured out of thin air"" in a bid to convince people there was no ""black hole"" in the nation's finances, the Tory leader said. ""This dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy Budget based on dodgy numbers,"" he said. ""You now propose to borrow, over the next six years, no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence. ""The chancellor's forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister's forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.""

Mr Brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said. There was nothing in the Budget that would put more police on the streets, make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. People would face a ""clear choice"" at the election, either ""more waste and higher taxes under Labour or lower taxes and value for money with the Conservatives"", he said. ""That's the battleground of this election. That's what this election is going to be all about and I say bring it on,"" he concluded, to loud Tory cheering.

"Whitehall cuts 'ahead of target'

Thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of London as part of a major cost-cutting drive.

Chancellor Gordon Brown said 12,500 jobs had gone while 7,800 were being moved out of the South East. He plans to axe 104,000 jobs to free up money for education, health, defence, housing and overseas aid. Unions oppose the plans but Mr Brown said £2bn savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage. A further 200 jobs at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been earmarked to be cut. At the Department for Work and Pensions, 30,000 jobs are to go, 560 will be lost by the end of the month at the Department of Trade and Industry and 400 are to go at the Inland Revenue and Customs.

In his Budget statement, the chancellor said the first 12,500 civil service jobs had been cut, on target. About 4,300 civil servants will leave London and the South East by the end of March 2005 and there are plans to relocate another 3,500. Of those 300 Department of Health posts will go to Yorkshire while hundreds at the Department of Culture will move to Birmingham and Newcastle.

Mr Brown also announced plans to merge 35 agencies into nine - described by one civil service union as a ""bonfire of the quangos"". Mark Serwotka, the leader of the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""In last year's budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the Tories. ""There was a time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up, nowadays the worry is whether they will have a job by the end of it."" He said Mr Brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the New Deal, while cutting ""the very people who deliver them."" The Treasury also announced plans to reduce the number of public sector workers on sick leave with a new system of checks and tougher measures against those suspected of abusing the system.

"Brown calls for £5.5bn Aids fund

Gordon Brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the Aids epidemic and find a vaccine.

On the fourth day of his six-day tour of Africa, the UK chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. Doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives, Mr Brown said on Thursday. He hopes to use the UK's G8 presidency to push the issue forward.

""I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation',"" Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour. The problems of HIV/Aids were inseparable from poverty, he added. ""At least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in low and middle income countries. ""Existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic. ""The UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (£27bn). A doubling of world aid to halve world poverty."" Mr Brown also said he had agreed with the Italian finance minister Domenico Siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.

Currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting, Mr Brown said. He called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each, thereby boosting the market for inoculations. This would be a ""large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms"", Mr Brown added.

More must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with HIV/Aids and their families, he said. But Aid charity Actionaid criticised Mr Brown's preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on G8 nations to fund HIV/Aids treatments. The charity's head of HIV/Aids in Britain, Simon Wright said: ""While encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an HIV vaccine is important, a failure to provide any funding for HIV treatments condemns a generation of people to death. ""HIV is decimating African countries, killing the most productive adults who should be working, caring for children and building the economy. An HIV vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. Treatments are needed now."" On Wednesday, Mr Brown visited slums in the Kenyan capital Nairobi . He will visit an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two.

"UK heading wrong way, says Howard

Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said.

""Britain is heading in the wrong direction"", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message. Mr Blair's government was a ""bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,"" he added. But Labour's campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: ""Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again"". Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.

""We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. ""Yet Britain's response has shone a light on our nation's character. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever."" He went on to reflect on the values that ""most Britons hold dear"". Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to ""turn these beliefs into reality"" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. ""How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? ""Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?""

Mr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the ""wrong solution"" to them.

""The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. ""Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today."" The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. ""We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. ""We simply need to change direction. The election will give Britain the chance to change."" This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.

But Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: ""It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January."" ""Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. ""With Labour Britain is working. Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.

"Act on detention ruling, UK urged

The government must act quickly on the Law Lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, Mary Robinson has said.

The former UN commissioner for human rights and Irish president told Radio 4's Today the government's response would be scrutinised internationally. ""It would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it,"" she said. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. Speaking to Parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation, Mr Clarke said: ""I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year. ""In the meantime, we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.""

Mrs Robinson said the Law Lords' ruling was ""in line with international legal opinion"" and praised their ""very decisive"" eight to one majority. ""What the Law Lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to British citizens,"" she said.

Mrs Robinson warned that a lack of action by the British government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. ""If the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the Law Lords."" She said a meeting of the Club of Madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the Spanish capital on the March anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications. ""I have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at, both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles, but also the response of the British government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there.""

The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. The Law Lords said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"". The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.

"BAA support ahead of court battle

UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.

The comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. ""We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,"" a BAA spokesman said.

Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.

At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was ""fundamentally flawed"" and did not follow the proper consultation process. ""We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,"" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: ""Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. ""It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. ""Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. "" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.

"UK 'discriminated against Roma'

The government's immigration rules racially discriminated against Roma (Gypsies) seeking entry into the UK, the Law Lords have ruled.

It follows a Home Office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people, mostly Roma, from boarding flights to Britain from the Czech capital, Prague. Civil rights group Liberty said it exposed ""racism at the heart of the government's asylum policy"". The Home Office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. It said it would look at the implications of the ruling, but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because Czechs are now entitled to free movement across Europe.

The screening took place at the airport in July 2001, at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering Britain.

Those refused ""pre-clearance"" were effectively prevented from travelling to the UK, because no airline would carry them. Lady Hale, sitting with Lords Bingham, Steyn, Hope and Carswell, said many Roma had good reason to want to leave the Czech Republic because of persecution. But she said they were treated more sceptically than non-Roma passengers by immigration officers ""acting on racial grounds"". Lady Hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.

Liberty said statistics suggested Roma Czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by British immigration officials at Prague airport than non-Roma Czechs. It took up the case of six unnamed Roma Czechs refused entry to Britain, and that of the European Roma Rights Centre, which said the measures unfairly penalised Roma people. It lost a High Court action in October 2002 when a judge said the system was ""no more or less objectionable"" than a visa control system. He ruled there was no obligation on Britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.

The Court of Appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against Roma, but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. Immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries, but it does not allow officers to go further than that.

Responding to the ruling, a Home Office spokesman said: ""The scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from Prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the UK.""

Welcoming the ruling, Maeve Sherlock, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""Human rights abuses against the Roma in Eastern Europe are well documented, and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group."" Amnesty International's Jan Shaw said: ""That the government's own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse, not least in the Czech Republic."" But the chairman of Migration Watch UK, Sir Andrew Green, said the House of Lords decision was a ""step in the wrong direction"". ""The basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.""

"Howard pitches for UK ethnic vote

Michael Howard is to make a pitch for Britain's ethnic vote urging people who feel ""taken for granted"" by Tony Blair to vote Conservative.

He will say Conservatives ""share the same values"" as the UK's minorities. And that he wants to build a ""better Britain"" where everyone, whatever the colour of their skin or religion, can ""make the most of their talents"". But the Tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is ""outdated and unjust"".

""It sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities,"" he will argue. Mr Howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the UK. ""People from ethnic communities, for example, still earn less than their white counterparts,"" he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was ""free enterprise, free trade, free speech"". The Tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that Hindus and Sikhs as well as Muslims got ""caught in the downdraft of Islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11"".

Mr Howard will make his speech during a visit to support Tory Parliamentary hopefuls Robert Light and Sayeeda Warsi - ""the first British Muslim woman"" selected to run for MP as a Conservative candidate. He will attack Labour's record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out Tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by MPs. Mr Howard will also attack the Lib Dems for wanting to abolish faith schools, introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven, and ""give contraceptives out in schools from the age of 11"". ""So I say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel Mr Blair and the Liberal Democrats take their votes for granted - come join us,"" he will say. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes branded Mr Howard ""arrogant and wrong"" for claiming the Tories were the ""natural party"" for Britain's ethnic minorities. ""Given the Tories' considerably reduced support in urban areas, where many black and Asian Britons live, during their time in power, the evidence simply does not support his claims that the Conservatives are the party for these communities,"" he said.

"Observers to monitor UK election

Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.

The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.

Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: ""I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced."" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.

But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges ""on a scale not seen since the 19th Century"". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.

Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could ""dramatically reduce the chances of fraud"". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed ""until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective."" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of ""dragging its feet"" over ""this badly needed measure"". ""It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,"" he said.

The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as £20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as ""gimmicks"" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for ""imaginative campaigns"" to boost interest.

"UK rebate 'unjustified' - Chirac

French president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's £3bn rebate from the European Union ""unjustified"".

Speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.

Mr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: ""One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past."" But a UK Government official responded: ""Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. ""There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.""

The 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a ""crucial test"" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.

The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: ""I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.

""The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU ."" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the ""justice"" of the rebate remained. ""We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. ""That continues to be the case.""

UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was ""set in stone"" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. ""It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project."" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.

Mr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. ""European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,"" he said. ""What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services."" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less ""neurosis"" about people coming from eastern European countries. ""In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,"" he said.

"UK needs tax cuts, Tories insist

A major change of direction is needed in Britain if it is to prosper, the shadow chancellor said as the Tory Party spring conference began.

Oliver Letwin said the UK could not compete with other countries without the £4bn tax cuts he was promising. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox had opened the forum in Brighton with an attack on Labour's record and party leader Michael Howard is due to speak later. Tony Blair has said Conservative policies would cause economic failure. But Mr Letwin said Britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.

""Can this country compete, can this country prosper, unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy?"" he said. ""If we are going to take on the great challenges, the challenges like those posed by the Chinese and the Indians, we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax,"" he said. ""The fact is the very carefully costed, fully funded plans we have laid out for saving £12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis."" Mr Letwin said voting for Labour meant choosing higher taxes, borrowing and waste.

Earlier, Dr Fox had said Labour's rule had been characterised by ""lost trust and failure to deliver"". He also attacked the government's ""failure"" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. A Tory government would sort out the ""shambles"" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said. Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech. His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party's opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament. The bill was finally passed on Friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate. Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.

"Brown targets OAPs and homebuyers

Gordon Brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120,000 as he put the economy at the heart of Labour's election campaign.

The chancellor also unveiled a one-off £200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. Mr Brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until September. The Tories called it a ""vote now, pay later"" Budget. The Lib Dems branded it a ""sticking plaster"" for the election.

Tory leader Michael Howard predicted the Budget would do nothing to help Labour's ""faltering"" election campaign.

""This government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems Britain faces,"" Mr Howard told MPs. ""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" He ended his response with an election challenge to Labour, saying ""bring it on"". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice. ""How can it be right in Britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax, as a proportion of their income, than the richest 20%?"" he asked.

Mr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation, saying it was ""high time"" the system was replaced by a ""local tax based on the ability to pay"". During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.

He said his Budget struck a balance ""between tax cuts that are affordable, investments that are essential and stability that is paramount"". He rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. The child tax credit will rise in line with earnings, giving families an extra £5 a week. In contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4,745 to £4,895 next month. Mr Brown told MPs child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children. Despite his giveaways, Budget documents show Mr Brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. He also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. BBC political editor Andrew Marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. But trust in Mr Brown's economic stewardship would be a central election issue, he said.

Mr Brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the Queen Mother, funded through a special coin to celebrate the Queen's 80th birthday. Other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to boost low cost home ownership. The level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £263,000 to £275,000 from April. Mr Brown said he had met his financial ""golden rule"" with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.

The economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters, he said, and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year, with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. The first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the Gershon Review have been achieved, the chancellor said. Some 12,500 civil servant posts have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of England, he added. SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Brown had failed the ""tartan test"" as there were no measures to boost the Scottish economy. Simon Thomas, of Plaid Cymru, called it a budget for Middle England. UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed ""more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want,"" not ""free bus rides"". The Green Party said the Budget was a ""wasted opportunity"" for environmental protection, adding: ""Brown obviously has an eye on the coming election, and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.""

"MPs demand 'Budget leak' answers

Ministers have been asked to explain how Budget details were printed in a London newspaper half an hour before Gordon Brown made his speech.

The Tories said a large chunk of the Budget appeared to have been leaked in what they describe as a ""serious breach of Treasury confidentiality"". The Lib Dems called for Commons leader Peter Hain to make a statement and said chancellors had resigned over leaks. They were told it would be brought to Speaker Michael Martin's attention. In the Commons, Tory frontbencher Andrew Tyrie MP demanded an immediate ministerial statement about how measures had been ""clearly, or at least apparently, leaked to the Evening Standard"".

Raising a point of order, he said it was ""the latest in a long line of discourtesies to this House"", as well as a breach of confidentiality. He said: ""I can only hope it is unintentional. If it were planned it would be a very grave matter indeed. A previous Labour chancellor resigned after he leaked the Budget."" Hugh Dalton resigned after leaking details of his 1947 budget to journalist John Carvel, who published them in a London newspaper, just minutes before they were announced to the House of Commons. Liberal Democrat David Laws said it was a ""very serious matter"" and said Mr Hain should make a statement on Thursday. Deputy Speaker Sylvia Heal agreed it was ""of concern"" but said nothing could be done immediately but the issue would be brought to Mr Martin's attention.

"US casino 'tricks' face ban in UK

Controversial new UK casinos will be banned from using American tricks of the trade to ensure they are ""socially responsible"", it has been suggested.

Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said proposed super-casinos will be different from their US counterparts. In America, pheromones have reportedly been released from machines to encourage aggressive gambling and clocks are often removed from walls. Eight super-casinos are proposed from 2010 if the Gambling Bill becomes law. Ms Jowell said the legislation would ban psychological trickery.

She told The Times: ""British casinos will be quite different to those overseas.

""They will have to act in a socially responsible way and will be tightly regulated. ""They will be run according to British rules and we'll simply not allow any tricks which people are subjected to unawares and which increase the risk of problem gambling."" One tactic used in the US is simulating daylight during night-time to lull players into remaining at the tables and slot machines. Casinos also frequently offer free food, drink and hotel accommodation to keep punters betting. A spokesman for the British Casino Association, which represents the UK industry, said the government was trying to allay fears over a ""UK Las Vegas"". He said the way the licences were being awarded meant UK firms were at a massive disadvantage and foreign companies would be certain to win the contracts. ""The UK industry is one of the world's most respected,"" he said. ""We have the lowest level of problem gambling in the world. ""We certainly don't use pheremones. ""The UK gambling industry is being totally frozen in time, and the foreign companies will take over.""

"Blair defends terror law changes

The prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying ""several hundred"" people in the UK are plotting terror attacks.

The government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes. But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the ""basic principle"". Mr Blair told the BBC the ""control orders"" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. But the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.

An explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons. On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. Some 32 Labour MPs voted against the legislation last week. Barbara Follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.

But the government is continuing to insist that ""control orders"" must be issued by the home secretary. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""We are being advised by the police and the security services... ""What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. ""And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.""

A YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in ""rushing"" anti-terrorism legislation. ""I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this."" He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that ""he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward"". Mr Clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. She said the legislation was ""a travesty and a perversion of justice"" and would remain ""unpalatable"" even if a judge was involved early in the process.

"Election 'could be terror target'

Terrorists might try to target the UK in the run-up to the election, London's most senior police officer has said.

Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year. Other potential targets were the royal wedding and the UK's presidency of the European Union and G8, he said. He refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. No 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.

The comments come after Tony Blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals, warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be ""unwise"" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. But he said: ""Terrorists have long memories. They understand what happened in Madrid and know what the impact of that was on the Spanish electorate.

""This year we are responsible for the EU presidency, presidency of the G8, a royal wedding and a general election. ""There are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with."" Sir Ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke has also warned that a Madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the UK too. Asked about Sir Ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We believe the threat is real."" The spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. He said No 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. Earlier, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were ""difficult issues for any government"". The Commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition, with the government's majority more than halved as 32 Labour rebels joined Tory and Lib Dem opposition. But Mr Blair insisted: ""There is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack.""

Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Mr Blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of ""using national security for political point scoring"". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy says that the plan is a further example of Labour's ""authoritarian"" response to crises. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. They would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against. But critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. The plans face further Commons scrutiny on Monday before passing to the Lords.

"Minimum wage increased to £5.05

The minimum wage will rise in October, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.

Adults must be paid at least £5.05 an hour, up from £4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid £4.25. The recommendations came from the Low Pay Commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. Businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a £6 rate.

A further increase in the adult rate to £5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for October 2006. According to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"". ""We have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact,"" said chairman Adair Turner. The government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.

Unveiling the latest increase, Mr Blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"". ""For too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families,"" he said. ""Too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay."" Chancellor Gordon Brown and Transport Secretary Alistair Darling promoted the news in Edinburgh, Wales Secretary Peter Hain and Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan in Cardiff and Northern Ireland Minister John Spellar in Belfast. The government has not accepted the commission's recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate, but says it will look again at the rate later on. Mr Brown said: ""We want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people, particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time."" The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.

The national minimum wage is currently set at £4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at £4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. A £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last October for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt. The Trade Unions Congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in October. And David Frost, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation. ""What employers are saying to us now is that it's at a level where it's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.""

The Liberal Democrats' economics spokesman Vincent Cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage. ""It's not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the Exchequer too,"" he said. Conservative leader Michael Howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Mr Howard hinted the Tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers. ""There are people on very low salaries, very low incomes indeed who really shouldn't be paying income tax,"" he said.

It would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below £12,000 a year, with say no tax on below £6,000. The losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over £100,000. Our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the US minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the US! Perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the US. This combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further.

It's still not good enough! I got a part time Job at 16 when I was doing my A-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for Uni. This was only 2 years ago and I was getting paid £2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!

We must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. An easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.

Any increase is certainly welcome news. However for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage I would simply ask them: ""Would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour?"". Thought not ... so then, don't expect others to either.

I can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! Also I personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you? It's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn't go a miss either. br /&gt;

This is good news. The minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer. Wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee's efforts. For too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. In very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. With the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.

It is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. They are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries, bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr!

I feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. Its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.

Here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! We all remember Michael Howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one! Jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. I think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and £5.05 is hardly a fortune. If your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!

Great keep at it Tony, I remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. At last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. We can't afford not to pay a decent wage. It's not a jobs at any price economy, goodbye sweatshops hello decency.

The increase in minimum wage is a good thing. Living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. In the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job I did in Plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in Exeter by 75p an hour. Hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.

I work at a large Hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate. Someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. How dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages? Who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow?

This is definitely the right step in the right direction. It shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. This is a million votes more. Good strategy isn't it?

Although I would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks. I am quite prepared for a raft of 'bribes' to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards, they are playing us for the fools they think we are.

This is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. By increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. The extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the UK, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. The jubilation felt by ""low-paid"" workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.

This will only lead to a reduction in jobs. Why have many of the call centre jobs gone to India. Blair say's the economy is ""strong and stable economy"" however consumer debt and the country's debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses, that will have no choice but to cut the workforce.

The timing cannot be coincidental. This is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such.

Andrew in Derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'. I don't mind if it is. In our degraded democracy, elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. My only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. If my maths is right, a 35 hour week at £5.05 gives you an annual income just over £9,000 and raising it to £6 leaves it under £11,000. The unions should be putting the Government under pressure for much more. Businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.

I am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. Also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. We are already seeing a sweeping change in IT work being lost to India where people are paid much less. It is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as 'sweat shop', but now we are told it is global competition. With our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. There has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. The whole picture needs to be looked at.

This is great news, but that might be because I work for minimum wage. Seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. When you can ""earn"" more from claiming than you can from work, there is no incentive. Perhaps a step in the right direction.

If the TUC get their way a very large number of SMEs will have to close - this will put more people out of work. How then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! The government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the SMEs but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. We are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.

While I'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, I am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. As an employee for a small nursery, I know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last October's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. This latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. If the rate rises to £6 then I can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.

The increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. Although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. The raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that I will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and I will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go.

I currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. Increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80% of my costs are labour. The other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses

It is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the ""lower status"" jobs.

I know about this great idea - don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage. The ones who suffer are the employers.

I hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that Mr Blair and Mr Brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?

I don't believe in the minimum wage at all! I think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. Now, before everyone thinks that I am some ""rich-kid"", I can assure you I am not. I came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a Youth Opportunity Program earning £25 per week. I worked hard, went to college part time, got my A-levels and degree & bettered myself. I now earn a 6 figure salary. I did that through hard work and getting off my backside. A minimum wage just makes people complacent.

To Ashley, of Swindon: when you earned £25 per week, it was worth something. These days that £25 would need to be near to £60 to have the equivalent buying power. I might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages. ""In my day"" type arguments are a view that belong in the 'your day' - 20 years ago!

As a graduate working for minimum wage, I welcome any increase of pay I can get. I disagree with Ashley, Swindon saying I have to work harder to get more pay. I have my GCSE's A-Levels and A degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages I should be getting, I should be on at least 3x what I'm getting but they can't afford it. We all work hard but the money is just not there. But on the plus side I love my job and wouldn't change it just to get more pay.

As an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year. These next rises will cost me more. I have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. So no one really wins in the end.

In answer to Emma from Sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary Mr Blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher Employer NI Contributions as well. If the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. Think of us employers as well Mr Blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions.

All workers should be entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. How many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?

It is good news for many Asians living in UK. Students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. I thank Mr. Blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.

"Hunt ban support is 'in decline'

Support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years, a poll suggests.

Less than half the UK wants a ban compared to almost two-thirds in 1999, the Mori survey of 2,000 adults for BBC One's Countryfile programme suggests. The number opposed to a ban remains constant, but those ""neither supporting nor opposing"" has increased by 11%. Most city-dwellers support the ban but rural people were evenly split between supporters, opponents and undecided.

Polling company Mori carried out both surveys. In July 1999 they asked 801 adults if they supported the ban for the Mail on Sunday. For Countryfile they asked 2,234 adults across the country the same question. The Mail on Sunday survey found that 63% supported a hunting ban compared with 24% against. In the Countryfile survey, 47% said they supported the legislation, with 26% against. But the programme makers suggest the British public are becoming ""increasingly neutral"" to the issue because around one quarter said they ""neither support nor oppose"" a ban.

"At a glance: Tory health checks

The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:

People coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.

Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.

People would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.

People coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.

The Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.

They claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.

Applicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.

Home Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.

The Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are ""quite closely modelled"" on the New Zealand system.

Labour claims the policy is little more than a ""desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan"" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were ""in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it"".

"Labour accused of 'EU propaganda'

A ""taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise"" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.

Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of ""running scared"" of debate. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.

Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005. Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"". Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was ""fully justified"". ""We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said.

Mr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. ""Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,"" he asked. The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand. ""The government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the British people,"" he said. ""Who are they trying to kid?"" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: ""Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?"" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a ""no"" vote.

Mr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a ""level playing field"" on immigration and asylum controls. ""You are setting your face against all of these things,"" he added. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the UK, to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.

"Terror suspects face house arrest

UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.

It comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. Charles Clarke's planned ""control orders"" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest, curfews or tagging. The Law Society dubbed Mr Clarke's new proposals an ""abuse of power"". Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001. Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death.

Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.

British citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. Mr Clarke also said intelligence reports showed some British nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith said the plans were a ""further abuse of human rights in Britain"".

Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in ""serious"" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.

He told MPs: ""There remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation."" He accepted the law lords' ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. The current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat, he told MPs.

There have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but Mr Clarke refused to back that change.

He said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources' lives at risk. Most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at Belmarsh prison, in London. Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis was worried about extending special powers to cover British citizens. He warned: ""Throughout history, internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates. ""So unless the process is clearly just, the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists."" He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.

Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. He said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be ""very high indeed"" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. Shami Chakrabarti, from human rights group Liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. She said: ""Adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. The government should not swap one human rights 'opt out' for another.""

"UK pledges £1bn to vaccine effort

UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.

In a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.

The chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.

If Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: ""Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. ""As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.""

"Straw backs ending China embargo

UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union's arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan.

Mr Straw, visiting Beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to China, Burma and Zimbabwe but not to North Korea, which he said had a terrible rights record. The EU imposed its arms ban on China in 1989 after troops opened fire on protestors in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw also signed a deal on China-UK tourism. It is expected this would increase the number of Chinese tourists by 40,000 per year, providing $120m in revenue. China has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. Mr Straw, speaking at a joint news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, stressed this point. ""The result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from European Union member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms,"" Mr Straw said. Earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.

But Mr Straw faces tough opposition to the move. Tory foreign affairs spokesman Michael Ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be ""irresponsible"" and would damage Britain's relations with the US. He said Mr Straw was ""naive beyond belief"" if he accepted China's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. The French want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to China; the Chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from Europe."" When he was in Tokyo earlier this week, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura told the British minister that his plan to remove the embargo was "" a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only Japan, but also East Asia overall"". Washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that China could use to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. Beijing says Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland, by force if necessary. The US is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself. Washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in China have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. It is an issue raised by human rights groups too. Brad Adams, from the UK's Human Rights Watch, said: ""This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square."" But Mr Straw insisted the EU's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.

"Pre-poll clash on tax and spend

Labour and the Tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over Gordon Brown's Budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle.

Tony Blair claimed a Tory government would ""cut"" £35bn from public services hitting schools, hospitals and police. Tory chairman Liam Fox accused Labour of ""at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie"" and said the ""smear"" tactics were a sign of desperation. The Lib Dems accused Mr Brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises.

Appearing together at a Labour poster launch, the prime minister hailed his chancellor's ""brilliant"" performance. And he claimed the Tories would cut £35bn from public services, which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the UK.

The Tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of £33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by Labour by 2011. But they say not a single doctor, teacher or nurse will be cut. Dr Fox said: ""We have said we will be spending more, year on year over and above inflation. ""And to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation, at worst a downright lie.""

Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin also predicted Mr Brown would have to raise taxes by £10bn or £11bn if Labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much. For the Lib Dems, Vince Cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the ""looming problems"" of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in ""massive increases"" for some. Mr Brown and Mr Blair staged a show of unity on Thursday morning, the day after the chancellor delivered a record-breaking ninth Budget.

Mr Cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties. The chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"". In Wednesday's Budget, Mr Brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty, unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a £200 council tax refund for over-65s. Defending the plans, he told Today: ""I will take no risks with the stability of the economy. ""All our spending plans announced yesterday [Wednesday], including what we can do for pensioners, as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax, all these are costed and affordable."" In a further sign, if any were needed, that the election is approaching, the House of Commons authorities have formally told MPs their offices will be ""deep cleaned"" during the three-week poll campaign. Mr Blair has yet to name the day - but it is widely expected to be 5 May.

"Plan to give elderly care control

Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.

Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. They also plan a supremo for adult services in each English area to get different agencies working together. But the government shunned opponents' calls for free long-term care.

There are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. Monday's consultation paper on social care for adults in England is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. Health Minister Stephen Ladyman said: ""This document is the antithesis of the nanny state.

""It's about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more."" The government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been ""disappointing"".

Ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. They also want to set up a new ""half-way house"" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that ""individual budget"". The scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. But Mr Ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas, such as freeing up NHS beds and preventing illnesses. He ruled out free personal care in England - which is on offer in Scotland and Wales, saying it was ""unsustainable"".

David Rogers, from the Local Government Association, said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. And Tony Hunter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice. Its director general, Gordon Lishman, said: ""Direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.""

The Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. Tory spokesman Simon Burns said more than 80,000 long term care places had been lost since 1997. ""After eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives - we need action, not a vision,"" said Mr Burns. The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over £100,000. Health spokesman Paul Burstow said: ""Promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share. ""But the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.""

"EU rules 'won't stop UK spending'

The shape of the UK's economy In graphics

But he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.

The chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.

Under Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules ""make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure"". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's ""sustainable investment"" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.

Mr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was ""impugning the integrity"" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.

Earlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more ""rigid"" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe's varied economies on one set of rules. ""The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,"" he said. ""The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy."" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. ""The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,"" Mr. Brown said.

"Child access law shake-up planned

Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.

Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC ""there is a recognition that something is wrong"". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.

Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:

- Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past 
 - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases 
 - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet 
 - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.

Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a ""nuclear option"" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.

Failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published ""in the next two weeks,"" a spokesman said.

The government's proposals have met with disapproval from fathers' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals ""lacked compulsion"".

""We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. ""Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart."" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.

The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were ""inadequate"" and were ""papering over the cracks of the current system"". She said a Conservative government would bring a ""radical reform"" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a ""legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation"". ""We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,"" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up ""like property"" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having ""rigid targets"".

"'EU referendum could cost £80m'

It could cost £80m to run a UK referendum on the European constitution, ministers have revealed.

In a written parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. Mr Leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous British referendum, held 30 years ago. Ministers say the constitution would make the European Union work better but critics fear creating a ""super state"". Labour MP John Cryer, whose question revealed the price estimate, said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. But he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. The 2001 election cost £80m. No date for the vote has been set but Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. Most voters said the UK should stay in the Common Market in the 1975 referendum.

"'No UK apology' for colonial past

The days of Britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, Gordon Brown has said.

The chancellor, speaking during a week-long tour of Africa, said it was time to talk about enduring British values of liberty and tolerance. Mr Brown has signed a debt relief deal with Tanzania which could cost the UK £1 billion. South African president Thabo Mbeki has attacked British imperialists, saying they treated Africans like savages. Mr Brown said that missionairies had come to Africa because of their sense of duty. He added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given Britain a greater global reach than any other country. BBC political correspondent Mark Mardell said Britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor's but ""never before has he been so outspoken in defending Britain's past history"".

The UK has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world's foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. On top of the relief deal with Tanzania Mr Brown said the UK would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. Under the plan - which could cost the UK £1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health, education and welfare. ""We make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us,"" the chancellor said. Mr Brown, on a week-long tour of Africa, spent two days in Tanzania before heading on Friday evening to Mozambique, a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.

There he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact. The chancellor said he hoped other G8 and European countries would follow suit. The UK has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the UK alone is owed - with the world's poorest nations including Tanzania. Former international development secretary Clare Short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.

"Parliament's record of scandal

In a locked room at the heart of Parliament there is a hive of scandal.

Sex, betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of David Blunkett or Boris Johnson.

Few realise that Westminster in effect has its own divorce den. For sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what's there online. Until 1857, the only way in England to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an Act of Parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. The legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in Parliament's Victoria Tower. Most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. This gives them the chance.

Divorce by Parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. Among the records is the story of Jane Campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband. That happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband, Edward Addison, had committed adultery with her sister Jessy.

A transcript of evidence from Jessy's maid, Amelia Laugher, shows her telling how Addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. It must have been a killer blow to Addison's case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5,000 damages ordered by a civil court. As well as making divorce history, Jane Campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. But divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and Parliament.

There are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the Protestants who pledged to ""maintain the true reformed Protestant religion"". There are details of foreign nationals made British citizens by act of Parliament, including composer George Frideric Handel in 1727. And the mass of private bills which, for example authorise the building of railways and roads, contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.

Tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the Palace of Westminster itself, listing the names of appointed tax collectors. This wealth of material has long been open to the public at the House of Lords Record Office, with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. But now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. David Prior, assistant clerk of the archives, says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research. ""Before, you just could not do it, you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material,"" he says. Mr Prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally. ""The archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change, mainly motivated by the potential of IT, which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us,"" he says.

The archives do, of course, hold records of high (and low) politics too for both Houses of Parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in Norfolk. Records for the Commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the Parliament buildings in 1834.

But that still leaves some of the most important documents of UK political history - parts of the Bill of Rights from 1689, the death warrant for Charles I, the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as David Lloyd George and Andrew Bonar Law. There is also the 1606 act establishing 5 November as a thanksgiving day - the year after the Gunpowder Plot. That document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across London to mark the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes' conspiracy. As Mr Prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat's skin): ""All human life is here.""

"Economy focus for election battle

Britain's economic future will be at the heart of Labour's poll campaign, Chancellor Gordon Brown has said.

He was speaking after Cabinet members held their last meeting at No 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that Labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the Tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the Lib Dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears.

In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime. He said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment, international development and the arms trade, family policy, and the reform of the criminal justice system.

Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said: ""We have fought a very positive campaign. I think he will want to look quite carefully at what Jack Straw said about Michael Howard.""

In a speech to the Foreign Policy Centre Mr Straw said of the Tory leader: ""He is clever, fluent and tactical, but he is not wise. ""He lacks strategy and good judgment, and his quick temper and impetuosity too often get the better of him."" The Foreign Secretary told the BBC: ""I was making the observation that because of Michael Howard's impetuosity you can get lurches of policy."" Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said: ""People are already really turned off by the kind of campaign the others are fighting and you will see us putting emphasis on some of these huge issues facing the world, particularly the environment.""

Labour's focus on the economy as their key message - came on the day a new report was published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, suggesting that household incomes have fallen for the first time in more than a decade. The IFS says the drop partly reflects measures announced in what it called the Chancellor's tax-raising Budget of 2002. The Treasury dismissed the research as ""complete rubbish"". Party election supremo Alan Milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by a ""world downturn"" which hit their profits. Since 1997, the reported average take-home income had ""risen by 20% in real terms"" if you took out the self-employed, Mr Milburn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Brown also dismissed the figures insisting that the ""typical family"" has been much better off under Labour.

"Blair ready to call election

Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.

The date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.

And Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.

During the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger ""cuts"".

He was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.

"Labour faces 'cold calls' inquiry

Labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on ""cold calling"" householders.

The information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the Lib Dems about how Labour uses its call centres. The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. Labour denies breaking rules. It says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people's voting intentions. The party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.

Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has written to the watchdog accusing Labour of a ""flagrant and systematic breach"" of the laws governing the TPS.

He says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. His letter to the commissioner quotes from a Labour Party handbook about ""identifying target voters"". And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.

The voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention, ranging from ""Labour (firm)"" to ""target (Conservative)"" - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting Tory. The newsletter says: ""Using the information we know about people, we can send them direct mailings. ""For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.""

Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: ""It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings. ""Insofar as this project is directed at TPS subscribers, it is equally clear that it is unlawful."" The Lib Dems raised worries about Labour and Conservative calls in February and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.

A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be Mr Taylor's. ""We are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us,"" she said. ""Obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations."" The commissioner's office will now examine the Lib Dem evidence. ""The guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on,"" said the spokeswoman. If Labour is judged to have broken the rules, it will be asked stop immediately. If it fails to do so after two or three warning letters, the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.

The party could appeal against the decision to an Information Tribunal. If the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules, it could be fined up to £5,000. Labour says it avoids those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making ""voter identification"" calls. Asked about the commissioner's inquiry, a Labour spokesman told BBC News: ""We expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. However, we are absolutely clear that we haven't broken any rules. ""As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law. ""We always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the Labour Party again.""

Ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett has given fresh clues that the general election will be announced on Monday.

He told BBC Radio Five Live: ""I'm out in my constituency getting ready for what we presume will be an announcement very shortly at the weekend."" He clarified that he meant he would be in his Sheffield seat this weekend, not that he expected an election call then. Tony Blair is tipped to ask the Queen on Monday to dissolve Parliament ready for a 5 May poll.

"Lib Dems predict 'best ever poll'

The Lib Dems are set for their best results in both the general election and the local council polls, one of their frontbenchers has predicted.

Local government spokesman Ed Davey was speaking as the party launched its campaign for the local elections being held in 37 English council areas. The flagship pledge is to replace council tax with a local income tax. The Tories say the Lib Dems would make people pay more tax and Labour says the party's sums do not add up. Looking to the coming elections, which are all expected to be held on 5 May, Mr Davey said: ""We are going to be winning more votes and winning more seats. ""I think we are going to have the best general election results and local election results we have ever had under [party leader] Charles Kennedy. ""I couldn't think of a stronger endorsement of a leader.""

"Tories reject rethink on axed MP

Sacked MP Howard Flight's local Conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election.

Russell Tanguay, agent for Arundel and South Downs Tories, said Mr Flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. The news comes despite Mr Flight's allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. Mr Flight landed in trouble over remarks on Tory tax and spending plans. He quit as Tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the Tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an MP.

Tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a Conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate. Mr Tanguay backed that view on Tuesday, saying: ""Howard Flight is ineligible to stand as a Conservative Party candidate. ""The association is in the process of selecting a new candidate.""

But the local Tory chairman made similar comments on Friday and dissent continues. Two local councillors who back Mr Flight met Mr Tanguay and the local association's chairman in Arundel on Tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. Mr Flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). The MP, who is consulting his lawyers, told BBC News: ""They selected me and they, if you like, dispose of me or keep me."" Mr Flight's supporters also say they have the 50 signatures needed to trigger the EGM.

At a news conference, Mr Howard insisted he had played by the party's rules. The Tory leader, who argues he is ensuring honesty, said: ""We do not say one thing in private and another thing in public.""

Labour election campaign coordinator Alan Milburn said the Tories were in ""turmoil"" because Mr Flight had exposed their hidden plans. The comments were not a ""one-off"", he said, claiming Mr Howard and other senior Tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said: ""Whilst I disagree with Howard Flight's views, it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth.""

It has also emerged Mr Howard has suspended Slough's constituency Conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate. Adrian Hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, under John Major's government, was an act of treason. The Catholic Herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of Catholicism in the European Union. Mr Hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate, Robert Oulds, was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife. Slough Conservative Association has now been placed on ""support status"" and is being run from Conservative campaign headquarters, says a senior party spokesman.

Mr Hilton on Tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal. He said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the BBC News website on Monday evening. ""There are people at Central Office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt,"" he said. The party says it did try to contact the local Conservative chairman.

"Ex-PM Lord Callaghan dies aged 92

Former Labour prime minister Lord Callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday.

He passed away at home in East Sussex, just 11 days after his wife Audrey died aged 91. Lord Callaghan, who leaves a son and two daughters, was the longest living former British PM in history. He entered Downing Street in 1976 after the resignation of Harold Wilson. Prime Minister Tony Blair called him a ""giant"" of the Labour movement. He held each of the major offices of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became Lord Callaghan of Cardiff in 1987.

Chancellor Gordon Brown said the former PM would be ""mourned throughout the world"". ""It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945, and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots."" Former cabinet colleague Lord Hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was ""immense sadness"".

""It was not a major surprise - I knew what a blow the death of his wife Audrey was a few days ago,"" he said. ""He was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely.

""The Labour party and the country will be poorer without him."" Conservative peer Lord Heseltine said that despite their political differences, he and Lord Callaghan became friends. ""You don't get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination,"" he said. ""But I saw the other side of Jim Callaghan, he became a personal friend in a way, and my family and I were very fond of him."" Tory leader Michael Howard said he would be remembered with ""affection and respect"". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said: ""When I was first elected in 1983 as the youngest MP, he was the ""Father of the House"" and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in Parliament.

""He was always full of warmth and wisdom."" Born in 1912 and educated at Portsmouth Northern Secondary School, Lord Callaghan became a clerk at the Inland Revenue. He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1942 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. Elected for a Cardiff constituency at the 1945 general election, he represented Cardiff seats for more than 40 years. After serving as a junior minister in the Attlee government, he became chancellor of the exchequer when Labour returned to power in 1964.

With sterling under pressure, he resisted devaluation for three years, before being forced into it in 1967. His political career was not without controversy. When he refused to support prime minister Harold Wilson and Dame Barbara Castle over the latter's trade union manifesto, In Place of Strife, in 1968, he said: ""I am not going to resign. They will have to throw me out"". When home secretary, he ordered British troops to march into the streets of Belfast to protect Catholic civilians amid rising violence - a decision that has dominated British politics into the 21st century.

As foreign secretary in the early 1970s, Lord Callaghan kept an open mind about the UK's entry into the Common Market, seeing the advantages of the UK's entry. He once travelled to Idi Amin's Uganda in 1975 to plead for the life of a British lecturer, Dennis Hills, who was under a death sentence for treason.

His political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party. In the autumn of 1978, before the ""Winter of Discontent"" when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill, Lord Callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a Labour victory. As garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff, council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work, Lord Callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country. When Britain went to the polls in 1979, Tory leader Margaret Thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory, and Lord Callaghan resigned as Labour leader.

"Blair prepares to name poll date

Tony Blair is likely to name 5 May as election day when Parliament returns from its Easter break, the BBC's political editor has learned.

Andrew Marr says Mr Blair will ask the Queen on 4 or 5 April to dissolve Parliament at the end of that week. Mr Blair has so far resisted calls for him to name the day but all parties have stepped up campaigning recently. Downing Street would not be drawn on the claim, saying election timing was a matter for the prime minister.

A Number 10 spokeswoman would only say: ""He will announce an election when he wants to announce an election."" The move will signal a frantic week at Westminster as the government is likely to try to get key legislation through Parliament. The government needs its finance bill, covering the Budget plans, to be passed before the Commons closes for business at the end of the session on 7 April.

But it will also seek to push through its Serious and Organised Crime Bill and ID cards Bill. Mr Marr said on Wednesday's Today programme: ""There's almost nobody at a senior level inside the government or in Parliament itself who doesn't expect the election to be called on 4 or 5 April. ""As soon as the Commons is back after the short Easter recess, Tony Blair whips up to the Palace, asks the Queen to dissolve Parliament ... and we're going."" The Labour government officially has until June 2006 to hold general election, but in recent years governments have favoured four-year terms.

"Brown's poll campaign move denied

The government has denied reports that Gordon Brown is preparing to oust Alan Milburn as Labour's election supremo.

Work and pensions minister Alan Johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp Mr Milburn, adding they would ""work as a team"". A report in the Sunday Business claimed Mr Brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy, while Mr Milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. Labour has always maintained Mr Brown would have a central campaign role.

But many Labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. Some commentators say the Tories have grasped the initiative, putting Labour on the back foot, having to respond to Conservative policy announcements. These claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the Tories have been gaining on Labour. Party strategists are believed to want to bring Mr Brown to centre-stage having seen support rise, in private polling, after his Budget last week. But another report in the Sunday Telegraph claims Mr Milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. Mr Johnson told BBC News: ""Gordon Brown will play a central role in any election campaign. ""They were wrong when they said Milburn was ousting Brown and they're wrong now if they are saying Brown is ousting Milburn. We work as a team."" Mr Milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift. Neither Downing Street nor the Labour Party would comment directly on the reports.

"Voters 'don't trust politicians'

Eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth, a new poll conducted for the BBC suggests.

And 87% of the 1,000 adults quizzed by ICM for BBC News 24 said politicians did not deliver what they promised. The poll comes after Foreign Secretary Jack Straw predicted trust would be ""the key choice"" at the next election. Both the Tories and the Lib Dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in Tony Blair, following his claims over Iraqi weapons.

But according to the BBC poll, 61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election, widely expected on 5 May. The poll also looked at what lay behind the lack of trust in politicians. Some 87% said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections, while 92% said they never gave ""a straight answer"". Just under three-quarters of respondents (73%) said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often.

Mr Straw told activists in Blackburn on Thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party ""best deserves"" their ""future trust"". ""That in the end is the key choice at the next election.""

He acknowledged that the public had lost faith in Labour, but suggested it could persuade people to ""reinvest their trust with us"" if the party could overcome Tory attempts to spread cynicism in politics. The Conservatives are keen to highlight the trust issue. During his response to Gordon Brown's Budget statement on Tuesday, Michael Howard compared the chancellor's figures to the prime minister's claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

The Lib Dems are also keen to highlight the trust issue, with Charles Kennedy has claiming voters had a ""fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister"". And the Green Party unveiled a billboard opposite the Palace of Westminster accusing the government of lying over the Iraq war.

Former education secretary Estelle Morris told BBC News 24 that there was a ""real problem of trust"" between the public and the politicians. She said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted, but suggested the ""three-cornered relationship"" between the press, politicians and the public had a hand in the issue. The public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in ""the battle of words"" between the politician and the journalist, she added. Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said the Iraq war had hit trust in politicians hard. ""Issues of war and peace, life and death do have a very damaging effect on the credibility of politicians"". Martin Bell, who won the Tatton seat from Tory Neil Hamilton on anti-corruption platform, said politicians often failed to see themselves as others did. ""We need public figures we trust to tell the truth and who can see themselves as others see them.""

"Tory candidate quits over remark

A Conservative election challenger is quitting after being quoted as wanting a ""period of creative destruction in the public services"".

Danny Kruger, who also works in the Tory research unit, had been due to take on Tony Blair in Sedgefield. He says his remark last week was misrepresented but he will not contest the election for fear of damaging the Conservative cause. Tory leader Michael Howard accepted his decision ""with regret"". Mr Kruger was quoted in the Guardian newspaper saying: ""We plan to introduce a period of creative destruction in the public services.""

In a statement, the party said the comment had been taken out of context. ""He fully supports the party's policies on, and approach to, the public services,"" said the statement. ""However, in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the Party, he has decided not to stand in the Sedgefield constituency at the next election."" Mr Kruger is continuing in his job at the Tory campaign headquarters. Labour election coordinator Alan Milburn claimed Mr Kruger had exposed the Tory agenda for £35bn of cuts to public services. Mr Milburn said: ""He is not some unknown hopeful fighting an unwinnable seat. He is a man who has worked at the heart of Conservative policy development... ""His claim that the Tories were planning 'a period of creative destruction in the public services' is not a rogue claim. ""It is the authentic and shocking voice of the Conservative Party. It reveals the true picture of what they would do.""

"Abortion not a poll issue - Blair

Tony Blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue, arguing it is a matter for individual conscience.

The prime minister's spokesman set out Mr Blair's view after the top Catholic in England and Wales backed Michael Howard's stance on abortions. The Tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are ""tantamount to abortion on demand"". The prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law.

Mr Blair's spokesman said: ""The Catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the Cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context."" His words came as Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, backed Mr Howard's stance and distanced himself from Labour. In a statement, he said abortion was a ""very key issue"", saying: ""The policy supported by Mr Howard is one that we would commend, on the way to a full abandonment of abortion.""

Cardinal O'Connor claimed Labour had ""developed"" the notion that it was the natural party of Catholics, but he said: ""We are not going to suggest people support one particular party."" The Family Planning Association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. More than 180,000 women in England and Wales had terminations last year, of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks.

In the Cosmopolitan interview Mr Howard said: ""I believe abortion should be available to everyone, but the law should be changed. ""In the past I voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and I would be prepared to go down to 20."" All three main parties say the issue is one for each MP's conscience, rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. Mr Howard stressed his views were his personal views. Shadow home secretary David Davis said he understood Mr Howard had been signalling that a Conservative government would allow a Commons vote on the issue. Mr Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also gave their views during interviews, conducted as part of the magazine's ""High Heeled Vote"" campaign.

Mr Blair, who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the Catholic faith despite regularly taking communion, said abortion was a ""difficult issue"". ""However much I dislike the idea of abortion, you should not criminalise a woman who, in very difficult circumstances, makes that choice. ""Obviously there is a time beyond which you can't have an abortion, and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue."" Mr Kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean ""I don't know what I would do now"". The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff, the Most Reverend Peter Smith, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the church merely wanted people to ""reflect on issues in light of the gospel"" before voting. Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association, asked: ""What is the benefit to women, or to the potential child, of forcing a woman to have a baby?"" Anti-abortion group the Pro-Life Alliance ""congratulated"" Mr Howard on his new stance, but said it did not go far enough.

"Profile: Gordon Brown

The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.

He reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: ""those who fail and those who get out in time."") There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election. But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.

Gordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.

His first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram. But in 1983, he took Dunfermline East, a new constituency including Rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.

Entering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair. Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.

The other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.

This dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was ""politics, politics, politics"".

If that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.

The ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more ""Old Labour"" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.

A truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to ""serve a full third term"" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.

"Boateng to step down at election

Paul Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is to step down as a Labour MP at the forthcoming general election.

Mr Boateng, 53, is to become the UK's high commissioner to South Africa. He was the UK's first black cabinet minister when appointed to his post in 2002, promoted from the Home Office, where he had been prisons minister. Mr Boateng served on the Greater London Council before being elected to Parliament in 1987, declaring ""today Brent South, tomorrow Soweto"". He will succeed the previous High Commissioner, Ann Grant, shortly after the next election, which is widely expected to be held on 5 May. The appointment is dependent on Labour's re-election.

Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ""Paul has been both a valued colleague and a trusted friend for many years. ""He has made an immense contribution to public life in Britain and I am delighted that he has agreed to continue that service to the people of Britain by acting as their representative in South Africa."" Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ""Over the past eight years Paul's contribution to the Treasury and the government has been exceptional - and it has been my privilege to have worked closely with him closely at the Treasury. ""I congratulate Paul on his new appointment. ""He has displayed huge dedication to the cause of African development for many years and it is fitting that, in this year of challenge and opportunity for the African continent, Paul has been given such a pivotal role in our fight against poverty and injustice. ""I look forward to continuing to work with Paul on this vital agenda.""

Mr Boateng said: ""I am honoured to be asked to take on this role, especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with South Africa and the African continent. ""There shall be many new challenges and opportunities ahead and I look forward to embracing them with great anticipation."" Asked if he was appointed as the result of a ""fair and open"" competition, he replied: ""I have been appointed as a result of a process that's been used before by Labour and Conservative governments to appoint people of all parties who have relevant experience."" Mr Boateng also laughed off suggestions that his re-election in Brent South seat had been in danger saying it was ""one of the safest Labour seats in the country"". Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said that, if in government, he would refuse to approve either Mr Boateng's appointment or that of ex-Cabinet minister Helen Liddell as high commissioner to Australia. ""Mr Blair's appointment of Paul Boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed Tony's cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts,"" he said.

"Howard hits back at mongrel jibe

Michael Howard has said a claim by Peter Hain that the Tory leader is acting like an ""attack mongrel"" shows Labour is ""rattled"" by the opposition.

In an upbeat speech to his party's spring conference in Brighton, he said Labour's campaigning tactics proved the Tories were hitting home. Mr Hain made the claim about Tory tactics in the anti-terror bill debate. ""Something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled,"" Mr Howard said. Mr Hain, Leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that Mr Howard's stance on the government's anti-terrorism legislation was putting the country at risk. He then accused the Tory Leader of behaving like an ""attack mongrel"" and ""playing opposition for opposition sake"".

Mr Howard told his party that Labour would ""do anything, say anything, claim anything to cling on to office at all costs"". ""So far this year they have compared me to Fagin, to Shylock and to a flying pig. This morning Peter Hain even called me a mongrel. ""I don't know about you, but something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled."" Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett rejected Mr Howard's comment, telling Radio 4's PM programme that Labour was not ""rattled"". ""We have a very real duty to try to get people to focus on Michael Howard's record, what the proposals are that he is trying to put forward to the country and also the many examples we are seeing now of what we believe is really poor judgement on his behalf.""

Mr Howard said Tory policies on schools, taxes, immigration and crime were striking a chord with voters.

""Since the beginning of this year - election year - we've been making the political weather,"" he told the party conference. Mr Howard denied he had been ""playing politics"" by raising the case of Margaret Dixon, whose operation had been cancelled seven times, which grabbed headlines for the party two weeks ago. And he hit back at Labour claims he had used Mrs Dixon as a ""human shield"". ""She's not a human shield Mr Blair, she's a human being."" Mr Howard said his party plans for immigration quotas, which have also been the focus of much media coverage, were not ""racist"" - just ""common sense"".

He pledged cleaner hospitals and better school discipline, with a promise to get rid of ""political correctness"" in the national curriculum and give everyone to the same chance of a ""decent"" state education as he had. ""I come from an ordinary family. If the teenage Michael Howard were applying to Cambridge today, Gordon Brown would love me.""

And he stressed his party's commitment to cut taxes and red tape and increase the basic state pension in line with earnings. He finished with a personal appeal to party activists to go out and win the next election. ""One day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as I will tell mine, 'I was there. I did my bit. I played my part. I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better'."" Labour election co-ordinator Alan Milburn said: ""Michael Howard's speech today confirms what we have always said - that his only strategy is opportunism but he has no forward vision for the country. In reference to the appearance of Mr Howard's family on the conference stage with him, Mr Milburn said: ""Michael Howard is perfectly entitled to pose with his family today. ""But it is the hard working families across Britain that will be damaged by his plan to cut £35bn from public spending.""

"Tories urge 'change at the top'

Tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election, declaring Britain needs ""a change at the top"".

The party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and Labour. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair's record in government. Labour's rule has been characterised by ""lost trust and failure to deliver"", he told the Brighton conference. He also attacked the government's ""failure"" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. A Tory government would sort out the ""shambles"" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said. Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by £4bn.

BBC political correspondent Shaun Ley says opinion polls suggest the Tories still lag some way behind Labour on the issues of health, education and the economy. Conservative leader Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech. His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party's opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament. The bill was finally passed on Friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate. Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.

"Sayeed to stand down as Tory MP

Tory MP Jonathan Sayeed is to stand down on the grounds of ill health.

The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament. The Mid-Bedfordshire MP had denied a claim that he was paid for guiding visitors around the Palace of Westminster. Conservative leader Michael Howard has now accepted the MP's resignation, it has been announced.

Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen ""well below the standards expected"". The Conservative Party had already been withdrawn the whip for a month. But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes. After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election. But the vote prompted constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell to resign in protest. The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed. Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was ""unjust and wrong"" but he made an ""unreserved"" apology to MPs in the Commons chamber. He insisted that the committee's report had contained a ""few errors of fact"". Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997. He represented Bristol East from 1983 to 1992.

"Howard's unfinished business

""He's not finished yet,"" whispered the Conservative Party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall. And indeed he wasn't. Michael Howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in Brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to Peter Hain's description of him as an ""attack mongrel"", claiming such personal abuse meant Labour was ""rattled"" by the Tory challenge. And here he was again, moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause, to make a personal, ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory. ""One day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as I will tell mine, 'I was there. I did my bit. I played my part. I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better'."" The speech, which was peppered with references to Mr Howard's humble beginnings as the ""child of immigrants"", had been introduced by his son Nick, a trainee vicar, who praised his father's honesty. ""I always know where I am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me,"" he said. Mr Howard was also joined on stage by his wife Sandra, daughter Larissa and stepson Sholto.

The audience's reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards.

But Mr Howard's overall message - that the Tories have Labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago. Mr Howard claimed, with some justification, that the Tories' campaign has got off to a ""great start"". They have had Labour on the back foot over immigration, with Tony Blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card, and have even managed to score points in traditional Labour territory such as health and education. The stunts involving Margaret Dixon with her postponed operation and Maria Hutchings with concerns about her son's special needs education may not have been to everyone's taste, but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing Labour to react. Senior Tories believe they are, at long last, starting to tap into the public mood, cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter. Their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline, cleaner hospitals (""I mean, how hard is it to keep a hospital clean?"") and immigration (""It's not racist to impose limits on immigration"") - under the headline ""are you thinking what we are thinking?"" This, they say, contrasts with Labour's negative campaigning, such as its now infamous ""flying pigs"" poster.

Oliver Letwin, one of the men lampooned in the Labour poster, affects bewilderment at what he believes is Labour's loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail. The Peter Hain ""mongrel"" attack, he says, is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product, he claims, of the Tories setting the agenda.

""I have to say I don't understand what they are doing. The Labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock, it doesn't seem to know what to do."" A few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for Tory activists' morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which, most analysts seem to agree, will hinge on which party can get their core support out. ""It has been a fantastic few weeks,"" said 20-year-old politics student Nick Vaughan. ""Our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think we could."" Some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970, when Ted Heath, behind in the polls and written off by the pundits, snatched victory from Harold Wilson's Labour Party.

They all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001. ""We thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn't happen,"" said John Murray, of Aldridge Browhills Conservatives. ""It was very disappointing. This time it really is different. ""Whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on. Blair is on the back foot."" Much of the credit for the Tories' recent change of fortune must go to Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper John Howard, of Australia's Liberal Party, into a serial election winner. The Tories still have a mountain climb if Michael Howard is to walk through the doors of Number 10. Even allowing for the natural bias against the Tories in some opinion polls, they are still behind, when to have a chance of overturning Labour's whopping majority, they should really be ahead. But as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper, the party at least has reason to hope that, like his Australian namesake, Mr Howard really isn't finished yet.

"'Last chance' warning for voters

People in England, Scotland and Wales must have registered by 1700 GMT to be able to vote in the general election if it is held, as expected, on 5 May.

Those who filled in forms last autumn should already be on the register - but those who have moved house or were on holiday may have been left off. There will also be elections for local councils and mayors in parts of England on 5 May. The deadline for voters to register in Northern Ireland expired on Thursday.

Completed registration forms can be handed into local authorities throughout the day on Friday, and some will accept them by fax. As well as for English county councils, polls for unitary authorities at Bristol, Isle of Wight and Stockton-on-Tees and mayors at Doncaster, Hartlepool, North Tyneside and Stoke-on-Trent are also scheduled for 5 May. Last week Preston City Council reported that more than 14,000 of its voters were not registered. Its electoral roll fell by 17.5% in a year - the biggest dip in the UK. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: ""Political decisions are made on your behalf every day but only by using your right to vote at an election can you really have a say on the issues you care about. ""If you want your voice to be heard on 5 May you will need to have registered by Friday 11 March."" Council tax payers are not eligible to vote without registration, officials have stressed.

"Sainsbury's Labour election gift

Science Minister Lord Sainsbury has made a £2m donation to the Labour Party for its General Election fund.

It is the latest hefty donation to the party by the billionaire - he has contributed more than £10m since 1999. David Sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the ""vision"" to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for Britain. General Secretary Matt Carter said it was ""a fantastic gift"" that would help Labour ""fight and win the election"".

""Through the generosity of David Sainsbury and other Labour supporters, Labour will be campaigning hard to take Britain forward and to stop the Tories taking us back,"" Mr Carter said. Lord Sainsbury added: ""I am pleased to be able to make this contribution to the general election funds of the Labour Party because I believe that they are the only party that has the vision to deliver both economic prosperity and better public services for Britain."" The 64-year-old latest donation follows a £2.5m gift to the party in 2003. Lord Sainsbury was created a life peer in 1997, a year before he was appointed as minister for science.

"Blair 'up for it' ahead of poll

Tony Blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be ""an issue"" in the general election.

The prime minister said he was ""up for it"" as the country waits to go to the polls, possibly in a matter of weeks. He told The Observer government life was a ""constant barrage of attack"" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute. Mr Blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture.

He said Britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.

Speaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: ""I am an issue, I always will be. Whoever is the prime minister will be."" He added: ""If you are afraid to take criticism, you should go and do another job."" Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: ""It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute."" Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make. Mr Blair's assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the Labour administration.

His comments come as the co-chairman of the Conservative Party, Liam Fox, on Saturday called him ""a disappointment of historic proportions"" as a prime minister. Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks. He pledged to clamp down on Britain's growing compensation culture, which has brought concerns that doctors, teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits.

""I was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case [against them],"" he said.

""We have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that."" Mr Blair said the government was also looking at ""how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others"", as part of a review being carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department. And there should be ""real debate"" about the risk posed by public safety threats, he said. ""We are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds, sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk.""

His comments come after the government announced it is to spend £200m on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu, and the Sudan 1 food scare. Meanwhile, Commons leader Peter Hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen ""dangerous complacency"" being displayed by Labour voters convinced of a general election victory. If Labour voters ""stayed at home"" in marginal seats they could see Tory leader Michael Howard ""coming in the back door to Number 10 with the tradesman's key to Number 10, getting into power"", he added.

"Labour MP praises Tory campaign

The Conservatives have been ""a lot smarter"" in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a Labour backbencher has said.

Derek Wyatt said having a five month campaign ""turned off voters"" and suggested people were already ""rather bored of the thing"". He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: ""By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. ""So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.""

Labour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been ""trying very hard"" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a ""sort of campaign of trust"". But Mr Blair had been ""hurt"" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. ""This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.""

"Top Tories on Lib Dem 'hit list'

The Liberal Democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top Tories - including leader Michael Howard - at the next general election.

Mr Howard's seat is at the top of the Liberal Democrats' list. Others targeted include Oliver Letwin, David Davis and Theresa May, Lib Dem's elections chief Lord Rennard said. He said it was ""nothing personal"" but that ""very many of the prominent Conservatives"" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second.

In 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone & Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907. Asked if this amounted to the party's much vaunted ""decapitation strategy"" Lord Rennard said it was not a term he had ever used. But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives. ""I just don't think Labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a Conservative."" He denied this strategy was opportunism, insisting the Lib Dem's policies on issues such as tuition fees, the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed ""to all sides of the political spectrum"". ""We are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote Liberal Democrat,"" he added. A Conservative spokesperson said: ""The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy. The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies. ""We will be pointing out how they are soft on crime, how they support higher taxes, their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving Europe more control over our lives"".

"Lib Dems unveil election slogan

The Liberal Democrats will present themselves as ""the real alternative"" in the forthcoming general election campaign, Charles Kennedy has said.

Unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no ""glass ceiling"" to its ambitions. He told delegates that Labour had abused the public's trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them. In response, the Conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the ""forgotten majority"".

Speaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: ""People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.""

Only the Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on ID cards, anti-terror measures and taxation. He said: ""If you voted Conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you? Your vote was wasted. ""What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister."" Responding to the claims Tory Party co-chairman Liam Fox said: ""Like Labour, the Lib Dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving Europe more control over our lives.""

Mr Kennedy also outlined his party's plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over £100,000 a year. The money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. Labour and the Tories claim the sums do not add up, and that working families would be hardest hit. Mr Kennedy said: ""Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have world class businesses and a world class workforce.

""So why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line?"" All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing. Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament. ""We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,"" he said. Mr Kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing Monday's Commons vote on the government's controversial anti-terrorism laws, along with 16 other Lib Dem MPs. On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was ""just a cock-up"" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14. ""Nobody had any idea that was going to happen,"" Lord Rennard told reporters at the party conference. He said he was certain MPs would get another chance to vote against the plans.
