The United Kingdom has been accused once again of discriminating against minority groups. This time, civil rights organization Liberty is calling attention to the country's discriminatory immigration policies that specifically target Roma communities in their pursuit to reduce asylum seekers. 
In a ruling recently handed down by the House of Lords, it was determined that the British government had intentionally and unlawfully denied access to certain individuals solely because of their racial or ethnic background – something which could potentially amount to illegal persecution. The case revolved around refugees who wished to enter the UK but were prevented from doing so on grounds related to race or ethnicity. It appears that this decision reflects a wider pattern within the nation’s current approach to migration and immigration matters. 

According to Liberty lawyer Pauline Bastien, the outcome highlights just how far removed from basic human rights some members of society still remain. “This kind of discrimination doesn't just affect those directly targeted; it sends out an alarm bell throughout our entire society that someone can be excluded simply due to where they're originally from," she argued.
It seems that recent events may serve as further evidence of the deep-rooted issues facing both immigrants and minorities living under British rule today. In June 2019, for instance, the government passed controversial new laws making it harder for many people fleeing conflict zones such as Iraq or Syria to gain refugee status. At the same time, reports indicated that the majority of those arriving at the borders between Calais and France were either Romani or Afghan migrants attempting to make their way west across the Channel. Despite repeated calls for greater understanding and acceptance of different cultures and beliefs, the reality remains that such disparities continue to persist along lines of national origin even though there are countless stories of successful integration found all over Europe. 
Of course, no single issue stands alone when considering the plight of those trying to find safety away from home through legal means - poverty, political instability, religious intolerance...all play important roles in shaping the lives of millions worldwide regardless of geography or nationality. Nonetheless, we should never forget how intertwined these problems often seem to become when faced head on with prejudice rooted somewhere else entirely like racism itself. As long as systems exist allowing us to judge one another based largely upon skin color rather than character then nothing will change until those structures come undone too – unless enough brave souls decide to fight back before its already too late!
