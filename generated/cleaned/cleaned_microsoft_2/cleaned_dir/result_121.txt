- The Conservative's General Election Campaign, An Eye For An Eye. 
- Derek Wyatt from Labour is not pleased by the Conservatives' tactics during their five month long campaign leading up to this year's United Kingdom's most recent national election - one which saw the re-election of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party. According to Derek Wyatt, the lengthiness of the campaign may have actually worked against them as it left many potential voters feeling overwhelmed or disenchanted with the process as a whole. He further added that he felt 'bored'' due to the same message being shouted repeatedly over an extended period of time. This lack of enthusiasm could prove damaging when considering the outcome of next week's poll, says Derek Wyatt.
