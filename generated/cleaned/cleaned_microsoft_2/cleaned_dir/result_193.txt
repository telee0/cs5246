The recent rise in deaths among prisoners, detainees and people held within correctional facilities across Europe is proving to be a major challenge for governments and policy-makers. At least 1 prisoner dies in the United Kingdom every week, which is more than twice the global average, according to analysis by Amnesty International. While some countries have seen dramatic increases in their mortality rates over the past few years, others have witnessed relatively stable figures. However, the issue remains widespread across the continent. 

In an effort to get ahead of the crisis, several European nations have implemented new policies aimed at reducing prison populations and improving conditions for inmates. In Germany, for example, there has been a significant drop in the number of homicides in recent years – from 30 per 100,000 prisoners in 2005 to just 15 per 100,000 today. Similarly, Norway has managed to reduce its homicide rate amongst female prisoners by nearly 50 percent since 2001. 

At the same time, many Western democracies are struggling to address the root causes behind rising crime levels, as well as the overcrowding and poor treatment experienced by those inside jail. France, Spain and Italy have all recently introduced tough sentencing laws designed to deter offenders and increase security within prisons. Despite this, critics argue that such measures may actually do little to reduce reoffending rates long-term, leading to further incarceration and potential harm to society. 

While it's clear that something needs to be done to ensure the safety of both prisoners and guards, it's also important to remember why we detain criminals in the first place—to protect society from further violence and criminal activity. Therefore, while harsher punishments may provide short-term satisfaction, addressing the underlying issues -such as poverty and lack of education– could lead to greater long-term benefits if they help prevent individuals from turning to crime. It's essential that policymakers continue to evaluate their approaches and strategies so that they can make sound decisions based on the latest evidence.
