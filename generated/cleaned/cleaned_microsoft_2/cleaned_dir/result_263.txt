The government is pushing ahead with its plan for another ‘pre-election budget’, according to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The announcement comes amidst widespread criticism from within the Labour Party itself, as some see it as an attempt to bolster the party's image before the upcoming elections.

Brown made the announcement during a speech in Edinburgh on Thursday night, arguing that the proposed measures would bring greater fiscal security and more opportunities for people across the country. He also went on to deny any biases in his economic forecasts, insisting that they remain sound despite what might have been perceived by some as overly confident predictions. This comes after weeks of tension between Brown and other members of the cabinet over how best to proceed with the budget, with many in the Party seeing it as an effort to win back support from those who had previously sided with the Conservatives.
