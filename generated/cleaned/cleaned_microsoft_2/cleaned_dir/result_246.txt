Support for a hunt bans appears to be waning in the United Kingdom (UK), according to a recent nationwide poll. In 2019, only 48% of participants expressed any form of support for such legislation, down from 63% in 2013 and 67% in 2009. The trend also extends to public opinion against the measure, as 22% of respondents declared themselves to be “strongly” opposed to it, an increase from 19%. Moreover, approximately 1 in 6 individuals showed no interest either way. These findings were published by research firm MORI on Thursday. 

Although some have argued that such surveys are unreliable due to their small sample sizes, the results point towards a notable shift in political attitudes within the country. To put things into perspective, back in 1999 less than 50 percent supported a ban – meaning more than half were still firmly against the idea at that time. Thus, it seems the debate between hunters and animal rights activists has grown increasingly complex over the last decade or so.
