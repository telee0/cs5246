Stephanie Pound, an English politician from the past decades of the 20th century, has recently revealed that in a time period marked by carelessness and recklessness (the sixties)  she had managed to have a child - a daughter. The woman's name is Lucy, which reflects both the innocence found in this young life-form and also Pound's own sense of delight for having been able to give one such precious gift despite his reputation. At the time of Lucy's conception she lived with Pound in London, where they resided together until she reached adulthood and began to pursue her ambitions independently. Although Pound did not know it yet, Lucy would come to be remembered fondly throughout the years due to its connection with the former's political career. In addition, Pound himself would go on to lead two terms in government before resigning amid controversy and scandal; while many saw him as a foolhardy leader whose actions were driven more often than not by impulse rather than any real thought or planning.
