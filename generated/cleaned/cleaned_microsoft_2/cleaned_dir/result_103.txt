The debate over the use of political influence and power continues as allegations arise claiming that the UK Government's decision-making process prior to going to war in Iraq may have been influenced by those close to Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is being reported today that the Conservative Party, led by John Smith, are planning an investigation into the matter during their upcoming session in parliament, raising questions for all three major parties involved. This comes following a highly publicised novel written by former attorney general Lord Goldsmith which makes several accusations against then Prime Minister Tony Blair regarding his choices before invading Iraq. The main accusation put forward in the book is that Gordon Brown, now out of office but still a member of the Cabinet, had instructed Labour MPs to vote in favour of the invasion regardless of what the official legal opinion from the government stated. This would allegedly undermine both the legality of the action taken and the trustworthiness of the British Government itself, potentially leading many to call for a full independent inquiry into the events preceding the conflict.
