    The final days for hunters to take part in traditional foxhunting activities have arrived, marking an end to decades-old practices. These hunts will commence in both English and Welsh regions before moving to other parts of the country over the coming weeks. As the hunt approaches its conclusion, it's evident that thousands of people are eagerly anticipating this eventful weekend. In addition, some meetings have even adjusted their regular agendas by scheduling themselves exclusively during this time frame. 

Hunts in England and Wales have been permitted until now because they're not considered sports but rather viewed as important cultural traditions within rural communities. However, following years of growing public opposition to such practices, legislation has recently been passed prohibiting the use of animals for recreational purposes. This new law officially takes force from next Wednesday at 12 midnight (0500 GMT) onwards when all licensed hunters must cease pursuing game using dogs. Nonetheless, there remain exemptions allowing those who participate professionally or possess special permits. Additionally, members of certain religious faiths may still engage in these activities without facing penalties.
