Political parties can no longer ignore the vast array of opinions from older citizens when crafting their political platforms. Older people are now playing an increasingly significant role in British politics, with many choosing to cast their ballot in elections despite being retired. 

The latest census data shows that the population of those aged 65 and above is increasing rapidly; by 2041 one third of the population will be elderly. With this in mind, politicians need to start designing policies which reflect the needs of this growing demographic. 

It's clear that younger generations, such as those aged 18 to 24, have different priorities to those of seniors. For example, older individuals are more likely to prioritize health care, affordable housing and access to public services. In contrast, millennials may be more concerned with tackling climate change or digital innovation.

Older citizens should also be actively involved in shaping policy debates. This means creating forums where their views can be easily heard, and ensuring their voices are properly represented in decision-making processes.

Finally, political parties must focus on reaching out to older voters during the upcoming election. This could involve using traditional media, such as radio and TV advertising, as well as targeting younger demographics through social media and other online channels. By engaging with older citizens and addressing their concerns, the next government will be better equipped to make decisions which benefit all members of society.
