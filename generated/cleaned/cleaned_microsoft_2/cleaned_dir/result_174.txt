The United Kingdom's largest civil service trade union is set to hold a vote among its membership on whether or not to go on strike over the government's proposal to raise the state retirement age from 60 to 65 by 2030. This move has been met with strong opposition from many within the bureaucracy, who see it as an unfair burden that will ultimately fall disproportionately on them.
    This potential strike comes at a time of heightened political tension across the country, with growing concerns regarding the current state of affairs and the future of the nation. In addition, talks between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer during recent weeks have yet to yield a satisfactory outcome. It appears that both sides are firmly entrenched in their positions, making it difficult to reach a compromise on this matter.
