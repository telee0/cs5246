The Green Party is concerned that many eligible voters will have difficulty participating in Edinburgh's upcoming transportation referendum due to insufficient outreach efforts. 
Edinburgh City Council plans to impose a charge on vehicles entering central business districts, but Green MSP Mark Ballard argues this could exclude citizens who do not receive official notifications or are unregistered to vote. Ballard points out that individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and younger voters in particular are more likely to remain uninformed about such initiatives. This lack of information contributes to higher levels of disenfranchisement among vulnerable populations. Ballot paper distributions must rely on updated, comprehensive data in order to ensure maximum accessibility.
