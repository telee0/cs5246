The announcement by the Conservative party that they will be breaking their election promises regarding immigration is meted out by the home secretary, Charles Clarke. This comes after the prime minister himself vowed to reduce migration from outside Europe. The Conservatives say this decision was made due to the changing economic situation and an increased demand for workers from other countries. In contrast, the Labour Party has yet to comment on their own plans for reducing levels of immigration or if they plan to keep their previous commitments. It remains to be seen whether the British public will accept the change in policy or not.
