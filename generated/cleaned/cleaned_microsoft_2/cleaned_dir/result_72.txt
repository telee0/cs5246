In today's political landscape, the discussion around retirement age has been gaining significant attention. There are those who argue for keeping retirement ages as they stand while others advocate for abolishing them altogether. However, recent statements made by Work and Pensions Minister, Alan Johnson have thrown yet another wrench in this debate - his comments suggesting the complete elimination of the concept of aging being an obstacle preventing individuals from making meaningful contributions to their respective societies. This bold move comes after years of exploring alternative options such as reducing or increasing the current retirement age limits set forth by our nation’s governments, but none had yielded satisfactory results until now. 
Johnson further stated that not only will age-related discriminatory practices like pension cuts due to older workers remaining longer at jobs be banned completely, all forms of ageism must end once and for all. He declared unequivocally that there can be no more ‘retiring before you retire’ mentality if any progress towards a fairer future is to take place in Britain; instead people should focus on what matters most - creating a world where everyone regardless of how old, gender, race, sexual orientation, or social class may still feel valued enough to continue working beyond traditional boundaries imposed upon us. In short, we need new models which better reflect reality and enable each individual to pursue goals without fear based restrictions arising from outdated conventions.
