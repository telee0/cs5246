New rules tackling ‘sham weddings’ have been introduced, making it more difficult for non-UK residents to marry in the country. The home office is aiming to reduce the alleged fifteen thousand annual sham marriages between non-EU citizens and British individuals by implementing stricter regulations. Those seeking to marry someone from the EU, Switzerland, or Norway will no longer require approval from the Home Office before marrying in the UK.
