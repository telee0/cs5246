Tory backing for ID cards - The Tories have announced their support for controversial Government plans to introduce ID cards, despite vocal opposition from within their own ranks. A tough debate has ensued among senior Tory MPs in recent days, as they grapple with how best to approach this contentious policy proposal. But now, following an intense caucus session yesterday night, it seems that the Party is set to come out in full force in favour of introducing identification documents into everyday life in Britain.
In addition to the traditional political divisions between pro-and anti-ID card factions – those who think it’ll be useful for security purposes and those whose main objection is based around civil liberties – there were also significant divisions amongst more centrist figures such as David Cameron himself, who was forced by his colleagues to publicly state his opinion before he could even consider voting for the measure in question. In light of the strong dissent expressed during Wednesday's discussion, it looks likely that any final verdict reached at Monday evening's parliamentary vote would go down heavily against the idea being put forward by Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
