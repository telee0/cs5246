The UK's current political climate has been in turmoil since the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this year. With the country now entering into the general election season, all major parties are jostling for position and trying to present their policies as the best way forward for England. 

	The Labour party has released its manifesto which includes four key points known as the 'four little words' â€“ health, education, housing and the environment - which it believes are integral to creating a better future for Britons. These words have become a catchphrase for the labour movement and are intended to emphasize the platform on which the party stands.

The Liberal Democrats have also announced their policy proposals including increased investment in infrastructure, such as roads and railways, and tax cuts aimed at helping low-income households. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Liz Truss has promised a focus on reducing bureaucracy and red tape whilst promoting economic growth through lower taxes.

With so many different views on how to tackle the issues facing the nation, the upcoming election is sure to be a highly contested one. Whether or not any of the leading candidates will be able to successfully pull off their promises remains to be seen.
