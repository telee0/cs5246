The world is waiting for news out of Spain as two days of high-level talks between Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and British Prime Minister David Cameron come to an end. The discussions have focused primarily on Gibraltar, a small British territory located at the southern tip of Spain. 

At the core of these negotiations is the future sovereignty of Gibraltar. Both leaders have been putting forth their views on the issue, but so far, no major breakthrough has been made. This has led some analysts to suggest that the chances of reaching an agreement are slim. 

However, there is one element in this discussion which could potentially change the course of history. Namely, the two leaders have agreed to establish a special committee to look into the matter further. This commission will be composed of experts from both sides who will examine all aspects of the situation before making any recommendations. It is hoped that this approach will help to find a solution which satisfies everyone involved. 

If successful, this initiative could set a precedent for other disputes around the world. Such a diplomatic process may prove to be an effective way of resolving conflicts without resorting to aggressive measures. It will also demonstrate the power of dialogue when dealing with sensitive issues. 

In addition, it is important to note that both Spanish and British leaders have shown great restraint throughout this difficult process. Each side has respected the opinions of the other, and they have worked hard to reach an understanding. This level of mutual respect is essential if the future relationship between the two countries is to succeed.
