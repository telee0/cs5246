    The world’s largest economy, Japan, has taken significant action in helping avert economic disaster in the wake of the devastating natural disaster that struck earlier this month. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced today that his government will donate $500 million dollars to relief efforts and has committed to provide additional support for those affected by the catastrophe. 

Abe's move was met with praise from international leaders who had been warning of an otherwise disastrous situation within the Asian continent. His announcement comes just weeks after Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall in the Philippines, causing catastrophic damage to the country and leaving millions homeless.

With Japanese financial assistance and aid from other developed nations, the cost of rebuilding and recovery efforts are beginning to look more manageable. However, the extent of the devastation caused by the disasters—particularly in vulnerable island communities—will no doubt have long term consequences. 

In addition to financial contributions, leaders from around the world have called for greater attention to being given to pre-disaster risk management strategies. Much like flooding and earthquake readiness plans have become increasingly common in many regions, experts argue that better preparation can help reduce both human and economic losses when catastrophes strike. 

Japan’s donation is a positive step forward in supporting victims of the destruction, but it remains to be seen whether such measures will go far enough to combat the widening gaps between rich and poor countries when it comes to dealing with the effects of climate change. With an ongoing global debate surrounding the most effective ways to avoid or mitigate the impact of natural disasters, Hiroshi Ito, director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security, believes that “only through collective effort [can we] overcome the challenges posed by these events". 

Theory Of Mind Exercises
1) How did Prime Minister Shinzo Abe feel upon announcing Japan’s decision to donate $500 million?

Answer: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe likely felt relieved, proud, satisfied, and hopeful upon making the announcement as it showed strong leadership and compassion towards fellow citizens during difficult times. He may also have felt encouraged knowing his actions could serve as an example to others and bring hope to people struggling in similar circumstances elsewhere across the globe. 

2) What were some potential motivations behind other world leaders calling for increased focus on pre-disaster risk management?

Answer: Other world leaders' motivation to call for increased focus on pre-disaster risk management might include reducing future costs related to reconstruction and recovery efforts; protecting vulnerable populations and environments; promoting equitable access to resources; and preventing further humanitarian crises. They want to ensure all people have the necessary tools available to respond quickly and effectively to any type of emergency event before it happens. 

3) In what way does UNU Director Hiroshi Ito believe that only through ‘collective effort’ can humanity face the challenge presented by natural disasters?

Answer: UNU Director Hiroshi Ito believes that tackling the problem of mitigating the effect of natural disasters requires cooperation among individuals and governments from different parts of the world. Only through working together can they share knowledge and experiences, identify best practices, develop new technologies, coordinate their response strategies, allocate appropriate funding and resources, build resilient infrastructure, implement early warning systems, create comprehensive policies and regulations and address inequalities at local, national, and international levels. By joining forces collectively, We can make progress in preparing for and responding to disasters and protect our planet against its worst impacts.
