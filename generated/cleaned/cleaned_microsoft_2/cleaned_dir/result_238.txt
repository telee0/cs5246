Patricia Hewitt, British politician and current Member of Parliament (MP) for Central Ayrshire, had strong views on Tuesday regarding political matters. She voiced her criticism against the “career sexism” which is present in politics today. According to Mrs. Hewitt this results in women's ambitions not coming into fruition as easily due to the lack of opportunities given them. This issue must be addressed if we want our society to progress and prosper according to its true potential. 

Mrs. Hewitt went on to say that she strongly believes that plans aimed at extending paid maternity leave need to become more of a focal point when campaigning during elections in order to promote equality between genders. These measures would have positive impacts both for mothers returning from taking time off work to care for their children as well as for businesses and employees in general. The additional financial burden such initiatives may impose can already be seen by looking at how expensive childcare costs are in Britain. Therefore, it needs to become much lower than what they currently are before there will be any meaningful change made. 

To ensure further success, it is essential that all parties involved take responsibility and commit themselves to making sure equal rights are granted equally among men and women in the workplace. In addition to that employers need to make sure they do provide enough support systems in place to enable working parents to achieve balance within their jobs while also caring for family members. Only then, can the real benefit be reaped from providing extended periods of parental leave. 

Therefore, it is clear that although steps have been taken towards greater gender equality in recent years; much still remains to be done in terms of promoting equal pay and creating fairer recruitment processes. By doing so, we could create better living standards throughout society while simultaneously giving everyone access to the same quality of life regardless of sex or social status.
