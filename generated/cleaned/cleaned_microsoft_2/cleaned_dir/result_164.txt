The Royal couple is facing criticism for their upcoming wedding. Despite being supported by many citizens and two thirds believing that it should be allowed in Britain, forty percent are opposed to the royal's marriage. This rate has grown from fifteen percent when Prime Minister David Cameron initially announced their intention to tie the knot. The announcement was made amidst a number of contentious issues such as global wars and economic instability. As a result, many believe this wedding serves as a distraction from more important matters. Moreover, some argue that the monarchy should not exist and its wealth should be redistributed to help those less fortunate. It remains to be seen whether or not the monarchy will continue to have a place in England in the21st century. 

As the wedding approaches, opinions among the British public remain divided. Many see the union between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer as long overdue, while others feel that it reinforces outdated social expectations of women. Additionally, some worry that the marriage will further fuel class divisions in England, with the Royals setting an example that few can follow. Furthermore, the current political climate means that many assume that the marriage will not occur without controversy. With the economy deteriorating and the cost of living continuing to rise, many fear that this wedding is irresponsible and unnecessary. 

Despite the opposition to the marriage, Prince Charles and Lady Diana's love story continues to captivate the attention of the world. They met when Charles was working as an aide to Diana's father, Lord Snowdon, and soon began dating. Their relationship progressed quickly, and soon the press caught wind and the two were soon engaged. While their engagement was short-lived—Lord Snowdon died just days before their wedding—their romance remained strong. 

The wedding itself is set to be a grand affair, with guests expected to dress up in formal attire. However, due to the ongoing pandemic, all attendees must wear masks and practice social distancing measures. In addition, the venue has been changed from Westminster Abbey to Windsor Castle in order to accommodate larger crowds. 

With so much uncertainty surrounding the impending nuptials, one thing is certain: Prince Charles and Lady Diana's wedding will go down in history as one of the most iconic weddings in recent times. Whether you support the monarchy or not, there is no denying the couple's love story and their commitment to each other. We can expect the wedding to be a celebration of love and hope for the future, regardless of the controversies it may bring.
