In recent times, EU has been facing unprecedented challenges due to its inability to control the ongoing financial crisis. Amidst all this chaos, one country which managed to remain relatively unaffected is United Kingdom (UK). With a GDP of 1.8 trillion USD as per latest data from World Bank, the UK’s economy continues to thrive while other European nations are yet to fully recover. 
The strength of the UK's economy can largely be attributed to sound fiscal policies implemented over the past decade along with an increase in public investment. These investments have helped drive growth in key sectors such as manufacturing, finance and technology. Additionally, government initiatives designed to promote innovation and research & development have further bolstered business confidence in Britain. 
Moreover, the decision taken recently not to join the Eurozone has proved beneficial for the UK's currency exchange rates, allowing them to maintain greater flexibility when conducting international trade. This newfound freedom provides businesses with more opportunities to expand their operations globally without having to worry about fluctuations in foreign markets caused by common monetary policy set up by eurozone countries.
Furthermore, it should also be noted that despite some criticism surrounding Brexit – i.e., the withdrawal process undertaken after the referendum held last year; –the overall impact thus far seems quite positive on both national and regional levels. For instance, since 2017 there has been increased access to global capital sources for small-scale entrepreneurs who require funding at lower interest rates than before 2014–2015 era characterized heavily by stringent regulations imposed by Brussels officials leading many aspiring innovators away from entering into new projects altogether due fear associated potential costs resulting from bureaucracy associated with obtaining necessary permits/licenses needed prior launch activities within Europe”.
