The political climate was tense as Prime Minister Tony Blair urged European Leaders not to ignore the reality that had been laid bare by U.S. President George W. Bush's victory during last week’s election. In his latest effort to make sure Europe takes action, he held forth against those still in a state of “state of denial” when it came to accepting the consequences of Bush’s re-election. 

Blair spoke out for one simple truth: America had spoken loud and clear this time around. He argued that if other countries wanted any chance of success in dealing with the current issues facing the international community then they needed to acknowledge that the old way of thinking no longer applied. It was now or never - either accept the facts or continue denying them. He stressed that Europe could ill afford another failure like 9/11, which would only serve to worsen relations between nations and lead us down yet more dangerous roads.

He also emphasized that the United States' stance on Iraq was sound; despite what some may have wished to believe there was ample evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This was why the UN Security Council unanimously voted for sanctions against him back in 2000 – but unfortunately none were ever enforced due to opposition within certain member states, particularly Britain and France. 

In addition, Blair pointed to how the US response to the September 11th attacks exposed deep divisions among its allies. Many Europeans felt betrayed after seeing Washington refuse to involve itself in resolving conflicts such as Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, while others thoughtlessly accepted American leadership without question. As such, it seemed obvious that the time for change had come – both in terms of how we approach global security, and our attitude towards America. 

To conclude, Blair concluded by calling upon European leaders to take responsibility for addressing these pressing matters head-on, before they become too difficult to manage. He reminded everyone present that the future of Europe depended entirely on our ability to unite together under common goals and principles, rather than succumbing to fear and prejudice. Only through working collaboratively can we hope to build lasting peace in an increasingly unstable region.
