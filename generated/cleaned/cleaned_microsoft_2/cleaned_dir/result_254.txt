The situation in Ivory Coast is quickly escalating into a crisis, with thousands of people taking part in protests against the government. In response, the French government has initiated an evacuation process for its citizens while UN peacekeeping forces are trying to maintain order.

British Prime Minister David Cameron warned that UK troops may be called up if necessary to protect citizens’ rights during this time. “We will continue to take whatever action is necessary to safeguard the lives and freedoms of those affected by this crisis,” he said. Meanwhile, his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, used his address to the United Nations to call for international support for Ivory Coast. 

The escalation of tensions between France and Ivory Coast comes amidst a wider region-wide trend of unrest. Across the continent, populist movements have been gaining ground, challenging the status quo and advocating for greater autonomy. This movement has been particularly strong in Ivory Coast, where decades of political instability and economic hardship have led to deep-seated grievances among many citizens.
