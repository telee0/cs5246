The recent events that took place at the United Kingdom's Parliament has sent shockwaves around the world. At least eight protesters, including two teenagers, are now facing criminal charges for unlawfully entering the chambers of parliament and disrupting a session.
The protests came as no surprise; the country has long had an antagonistic relationship between itself and its government. Many citizens feel that their voices are not heard by their elected officials, leading to frequent clashes between protestors and law enforcement officers. This time was no different; when the debating team began discussing the new bill regarding the banning of hunting, things quickly escalated.
Protesters gave voice to their discontentment by shouting slogans and throwing objects at the members of parliament. They also broke through one of the doors and entered the hall where the lawmakers were meeting. The police were immediately called to the scene and managed to arrest seven people, though they released two others due to lack of evidence.
It is clear that this event highlights the increasing divide between the public and the government. The protesters' actions were seen by many as disrespectful and threatening, while some viewed it as a necessary part of exercising their right to freedom of speech. No matter what one's opinion may be, the fact remains that this incident will go down in history as an example of the tensions which exist within our political system.
If the defendants are found guilty of the charges brought against them then they could face up to four years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. It is important that those involved understand the serious nature of the law and the consequences of breaking it. The UK government has expressed its disappointment over the event, but it is up to each individual to decide whether or not such violence is ever justified.
