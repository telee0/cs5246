Blair, who served as Prime Minister from 1997-2007 and again since 2007 until today, has been a key figure in British politics. Throughout his long career, Blair has faced numerous controversies and criticisms over various issues including his foreign policy decisions, Iraq War policies, and leadership style. In recent years, however, there have also been many accolades bestowed upon him for having played an important role during one of Britain's most tumultuous times - Brexit negotiations with Brussels. 
In light of the upcoming General Election that is scheduled for May 2022, Boris Johnson is once again vying for the position of PM against former Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Chancellor Rishi Sunak. With so much at stake for both candidates, it remains unclear whether or not any particular candidate may emerge victorious on polling day. However, all three parties are currently running neck-to-neck in opinion polls which suggest that each party could potentially come out on top if enough votes were cast. Additionally, the rise in popularity among Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has further complicated matters for the Conservative Party while raising hopes amongst some Labour supporters. 
Meanwhile, other topics such as immigration reform, climate change mitigation strategies, health care access reforms, education investment programs, housing affordability initiatives etc. continue to dominate political discussions across Great Britain. These debates reflect deeply held values by those involved and provide insight into their respective priorities should they win power. Thus far this year alone we have seen significant changes made through legislation related to environmental protection measures; new taxes imposed on certain industries/companies deemed harmful towards the environment (e.g., carbon tax); increased investments into public infrastructure projects such as improved railway lines between major cities & townships along with updated transportation systems throughout urban areas nationwide
