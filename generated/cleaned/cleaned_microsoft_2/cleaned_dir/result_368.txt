    This week, former Home Secretary David Blunkett has given new indications of when the UK General Election may take place. The Labour Party's leader, Gordon Brown, has so far refused to say whether or not an election should be held before the current one in 2005. However, Blunkett suggested that the election might be called as soon as late September. This is particularly significant because it gives the Conservative Party less time to prepare a defence against the potential election. It is also a reminder that the decision of when to hold a general election remains largely within the discretion of the Prime Minister.
