The UK is taking its civics and education seriously by introducing special events to recognise when citizens reach 18 years old. The announcement was made by Minister of State for Culture, Communications, and Creative Industries, Charles Clarke, during his time at a parliamentary debate. An additional 12 months of grants have been provided by the Department for Education to local authorities so they can run programs focused on civic awareness and understanding.

Charles Clarke went on to say that this initiative should be seen “as part of an overhaul of how our government engages with what we like to call 'inclusive citizenship'". This involves raising awareness of all citizens’ rights and responsibilities, regardless of ethnicity, gender or age.

The new programmes will focus on educating the public in regards to democracy, justice and human rights. They aim to empower citizens to become active participants in society by providing insight into their roles in shaping policy and decision-making processes. These activities include community organising, participating in debates and campaigns, and volunteering. 

The British government has also decided to introduce commemorative ceremonies to acknowledge the transition from childhood to adulthood. The launch of the Australian model in Oxfordshire will mark the first phase of these celebrations. Other areas will soon follow suit and offer similar ceremonies for turning 18. 

These ceremonies will be integral in promoting civic engagement among young adults and encourage them to develop meaningful connections with their communities. By offering recognition and celebration of this important milestone, the government hopes to cultivate an environment where everyone feels valued and included in society.
