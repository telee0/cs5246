Oliver Letwin, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, has today dismissed suggestions that his pre-budget report indicates any imminent change in government policy on taxation or public spending. 
Letwin, speaking in Westminster, made it clear that there were no immediate plans for changes which could have significant impacts on either sector as he sought to reassure citizens of the United Kingdom regarding their financial security. 
“This announcement does not represent a major shift in our approach towards taxes or welfare benefits," said Letwin. “It remains very important that we continue to focus on reducing debt levels whilst ensuring essential services such as healthcare are properly funded." 
He added that while they had taken steps this year to reduce costs, further adjustments might be necessary depending on how quickly GDP grows over the course of 2020. 
The British prime minister Boris Johnson welcomed the move by Letwin but warned against making decisions too soon due to uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Johnson commented, saying "We must remain mindful of the potential risks posed by new variants of coronavirus so that all Britons can feel secure knowing their finances will remain protected". 
Although some analysts believe that this announcement suggests little realignment from current political strategy, others suggested that certain aspects of the budget may indicate future moves in terms of taxation policy. David Greenaway, director of research at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), noted that while it appears there will likely still be no increase in fuel duties - despite calls from environmental campaigners – other areas such as capital gains tax might face cuts if inflation continues to rise rapidly. 
These comments came after Prime Minister Johnson announced earlier in the day that the UK Treasury expects Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% next quarter compared to 2.4% during the last three months of 2019. He also predicted that unemployment rates will drop significantly over coming months thanks in part to efforts being made across different sectors including retail, hospitality and tourism industries.
