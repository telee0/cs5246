Few politicians were prepared for the upcoming Information Act, which is set to take effect in just over one month. Despite its potential implications on transparency and accountability, very few members of parliament were equipped with the knowledge required to make use of this powerful tool. The lack of readiness among lawmakers highlights a concerning trend; government officials appear to have failed in their duties to adequately inform the political establishment about how they can leverage the new law. As such, citizens remain unaware of their rights to request and access government data as well as records kept by public organizations. 
The report released by the all-parties' committee further identified that thousands more public authorities had yet to implement any form of preparation for the Data Protection Acts (DPA) since 2005. This implies that even when the relevant legislation has been established, there still remains insufficient awareness regarding how it should be enforced or utilized. Moreover, the findings suggest that some local councils have actually gone so far as to deny access to requests made under both DPA and FOIA. When contacted for comment, representatives from the Ministry of Justice could only provide vague assurances of increased guidance being provided to those affected, while failing to acknowledge whether similar efforts had already taken place during the last Parliament. It seems that much work needs to be done before next year's deadline passes without proper consideration being given to ensuring everyone involved understands what their obligations entail.
