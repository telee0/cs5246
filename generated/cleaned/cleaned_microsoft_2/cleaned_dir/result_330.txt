The upcoming presidential elections in the United States have been met with a great deal of scrutiny and tension, as many fear that the world could see violence and discord. With no clear candidate leading the race, both parties have been raising campaign funds from various sources, while people from all walks of life have been debating the issues at hand. 

The current political climate has left many citizens feeling uncertain and afraid for the future of their country. Many opinions are divided and division is growing between supporters and opponents of the two major parties. Despite this, it is important to note that neither side is responsible for the increasing hostility and negativity that has become so prevalent in the public discourse.

The debates over the next president have been highly contentious, with both candidates throwing mud at each other and attacking the other's beliefs. This has resulted in a divisive atmosphere where neither sides can agree, and it seems that the entire nation is becoming increasingly polarized.

With the election just days away, it is hard to predict what the final result will be. Both candidates have spent the last month campaigning heavily, and they have both promised the American people something different. But, with the high tensions and strong emotions surrounding the topic, there is no telling which way things will turn out. 

Even though the voters have had time to decide, the reality is that the new president will soon be taking office, whether the citizens like it or not. And so, only time will tell who will lead the most prosperous and successful America.
