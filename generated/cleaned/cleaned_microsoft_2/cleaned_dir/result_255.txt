Charles Clarke, the former Home Secretary and current Prime Minister of Britain, is set to continue pressing ahead with plans to introduce national identity cards. Despite calls by some politicians for an immediate halt in their implementation, Mr Clarke remains committed to seeing through his party's policy on this issue. 

The decision has been met with mixed reactions across political circles. Some supporters of the government's stance argue that ID cards will help protect citizens against terrorism and other forms of crime. They claim that having access to accurate information regarding someone's identity would make it much harder for criminals or terrorists to operate without being identified. Additionally, they suggest the cards could serve as an effective tool in reducing fraud and increasing security within both public and private sectors. 

On the other hand, critics are more cautious in their assessment of the plan. Many opponents have voiced concerns over privacy issues arising from the introduction of such an extensive system. They worry that personal data gathered during registration may be misused or abused - raising serious questions around civil liberties and individual freedoms. Furthermore, there have been fears raised concerning how those who cannot afford to obtain identification documents (such as immigrants and refugees) might feel disenfranchised or even further marginalized if forced into obtaining one. 

Despite the controversy surrounding ID card schemes, Charles Clarke has maintained his commitment towards implementing them. In fact, following the recent resignation of his predecessor, David Blunkett, Clarke has used the changeover in leadership as an opportune moment to re-examine the necessity of introducing the scheme. He has stated that although he supports the principle behind the idea, he wishes to explore all possible alternatives before making any final decisions. This move appears to signal a willingness to listen to opposing views while still maintaining a firm focus upon achieving his ultimate goal of nationwide identification. 


Consider a hypothetical situation where the National Identity Card Scheme (NICS) is implemented under four conditions. These are:
1. If Charles Clarke supports the NICS then the Labour Party also approves it.
2. Either Charles Clarke opposes the NICS or the Conservative Party does not approve it but both do support Blair's policies.
3. If Blair's approval increases the chances of the scheme passing Parliament than only Labour and the Conservatives' approval matter. However, if neither of these two parties supports the scheme, its passage becomes doubtful regardless of the majority votes from MPs. 
4. If at least 70% of MPs support the scheme, it gets passed. Otherwise, it doesn't pass no matter what percentage of members of either party agree with its enactment.

Now let us assume the above mentioned statements hold true given the circumstances detailed in the previous paragraphs; Charles Clarke indeed continues with the NICS plans despite pressure to reconsider. Given this new development, answer the following questions using logical deductions:
Question: What can we say about the potential outcome of NICS? Who among the three main parties (Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats), if any, must now oppose it based on our assumptions so far?


From Statement 4, since the minimum requirement for passage is 70%, and assuming all major parties have already expressed their opinions, if less than 70% of MPs were willing to vote in favor of the bill, even though every single major party except one supports the measure, it wouldn’t get passed. Therefore, at least 3/10th of the total number of MPs should disagree with the proposal otherwise it won’t succeed. We know that all three parties support Blair’s policies which gives each of them equal weightage in terms of supporting the Bill because of statement 2. Hence, if none of these three parties disagrees (which contradicts statement 1 and 2), it means at most 10 out of 100 parliamentarians would disapprove of the Bill leading up to its voting process thus ensuring failure according to rule 4. Consequently, if we consider statement 3, since neither Labour nor the Conservatives' support matters after Blair's support due to his high influence factor. So, if any of the other minor parties like the Liberals oppose Blair's approach, it shouldn't impact the fate of the Bill negatively since it would need a higher threshold to fail. Thus, based on the assumption that all parties support Blair's policies including the opposition ones and considering that the required majority for success is 7 out of 10, at least 2 opposition leaders or parties must now officially voice disapproval of NICS if it passes through parliamentary procedures.
Answer: If the proposed National Identity Cards Scheme successfully goes forward, it implies at least 5 out of 8 parties
