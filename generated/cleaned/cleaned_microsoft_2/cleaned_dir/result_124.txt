The EU referendum campaign has been met with stiff opposition from politicians and the public alike. Many argue that it will be too costly, with the potential to reach up to Â£80 million, almost double the amount spent in a recent general election. However, others feel that the decision of whether or not to remain part of the European Union is a deeply personal one and should not be forced upon the nation by taxpayers.

The referendum has sparked wide debate across the country, with many arguing over the pros and cons of remaining in the European union. Opponents of the referendum argue that staying in the EU may lead to the loss of sovereignty, while supporters insist that remaining in the EU brings great benefits such as free trade, peace and security, and economic stability. 

Prime Minister David Cameron has urged the nation to vote to remain in the EU, stressing the importance of being part of an international community. Meanwhile, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has warned that leaving the EU could seriously harm the environment, pointing to the EU's regulations on carbon emissions, water quality, and wildlife protection. 

To make sure that the voting process is fair and secure, the government has hired thousands of extra police officers to oversee the referendum. This has led to concerns from some critics who believe that the high number of troops is an unnecessary expense. 

Despite this, the referendum remains scheduled to take place next month. The outcome is expected to be highly contested and the political consequences of the result are yet to be seen. One thing is for certain though: the Brexit issue has become a major topic during the past few months, and it is likely to continue to be a prominent feature in the coming years.
