'The Campaign Group To Target Marginal Labour Seats With A New Approach In 2019 Elections. 'Save The Scottish Regiments (STSR) has announced its intent to run candidates in all three of Scotland’s marginal constituencies, including the seat held by Defence Secretary Adam Ingram MP as part of an effort to contest the upcoming general election on 12th June 2020. According to reports from the BBC, the TSGR is targeting nine marginal Labour seats across England and Wales where they believe that their efforts could make a significant impact on voting patterns “ We believe it [the TSGR] has identified areas were there can be real change made,” said former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown who founded the organisation back in 2018 following his retirement. The list includes Aberdeen South, Dunfermline, Edinburgh Eastern, Fife Central & Kirkcaldy, Glasgow East, Lothian North & Midlothian, Orkney, Renfrewshire Central & Pollokshaws and Waverley. The TSGR claims to have been able to secure the endorsement of several prominent figures within each respective constituency ahead of the announcement being released ‘ This is our first time running for any kind of national office and we know how hard this process is going to be so having those endorsements behind us makes things much easier,' added Brown who previously served two terms as Chancellor Of The Exchequer during the Blair/Brown administration before becoming Leader Of The Opposition.
