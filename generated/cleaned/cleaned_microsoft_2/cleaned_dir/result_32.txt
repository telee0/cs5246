Article 1 : Analysis : No Pain, No Gain? 
In recent times, there's been a new buzzword thrown around by political leaders all over the world. It’s one they use when referring to their own strategies – “no pain, no gain.” But what does this phrase actually mean? To understand its importance, we must look at how it was originally used and why politicians are continuing to employ it today.

The concept behind `No Pain, No Gain` can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy where it was believed that true progress could only come from enduring suffering or hardship. This idea has since become popularized by American writer William James who argued that hard work, sacrifice and dedication were essential if someone wanted to achieve success in life. Since then, the saying has been adopted by many people as part of their personal motivation system; they believe that any effort made towards reaching a goal will ultimately lead to greater rewards down the line.

For some politicians, using this phrase takes on a more specific meaning. They view it as their way of demonstrating resilience and strength during difficult moments while facing intense scrutiny from both public opinion and the media. In particular, Prime Minister Tony Blair recently embraced the concept himself when he went ahead with plans for further interventionism despite opposition criticism. By taking such bold action, he demonstrated not only courage but also faithfulness to his beliefs even under pressure.

So far, it appears that the use of `No Pain, No Gain` has proven successful amongst certain circles of voters. According to research conducted in 2020, those surveyed found it reassuring to see their leader willing to make tough choices regardless of whether or not they received approval beforehand. Additionally, it suggests a level of confidence among the electorate regarding their government’s ability to handle challenging situations without fear of failure.

Of course, some have raised concerns about the potential downsides associated with relying too heavily on `No Pain, No Gain`. For example, critics argue that constant exposure to stressful circumstances might weaken citizens’ trust in their elected officials due to repeated instances where promises weren't kept or expectations weren't met. Similarly, others worry that prolonged periods of difficulty may leave citizens feeling demoralised which would eventually result in apathy rather than engagement with civic affairs. Therefore, it should be remembered that although embracing hardship might sometimes yield positive outcomes, it doesn't always guarantee success.
