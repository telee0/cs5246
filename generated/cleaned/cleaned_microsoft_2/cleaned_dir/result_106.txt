The Ministry of Education has announced that over 6000 primary, secondary and high school pupils from across England, Wales and Scotland will be participating in a nationwide mock election. 

According to a report published on Wednesday 1st May 2005, students are being encouraged to engage with the electoral process through this series of elections which aims to boost young people’s understanding of politics and democracy. A total of 600 schools have already indicated an interest in getting involved and the initiative is jointly-run by the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills.

The ballot will see students assume the role of either a Labour or Conservative candidate and campaign for votes amongst their peers. To prepare them for election day, pupils are developing speeches, making posters and writing newsletters – tasks which give them a real insight into the world of politics. The goal is to encourage active citizenship and empower young people to make their voices heard. 

The youth vote is seen as a vital component of democratic society. According to a recent survey conducted by the Institute of Social and Economic Research, only one in five voters aged between 18 and 24 turned out in the 2004 US presidential election. This low turnout has been attributed to feelings of apathy and disillusionment among younger generations, who often feel excluded from traditional forms of politics.

To combat this trend, initiatives such as the mock election provide an opportunity for young people to engage with the issues and develop an appreciation for the importance of civic participation. It also offers a chance to educate future citizens on how the political system works and gives them practice in debating key policy issues.
