The UK political landscape is undergoing an unprecedented change, thanks in no small part to the emergence of two major forces on the national stage. The first of these parties is the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, who are pushing for greater control over government decisions and policies; while the other is the Liberal Democrats, under the leadership of Sir Charles Kennedy, who are seeking to promote more lenient ideologies and solutions that focus more on social justice and equality. 

With elections just around the corner, both parties have been working hard to secure support from the British public. On Monday, Sir Charles Kennedy began a seven-day campaign trail across Somerset and Hampshire, two relatively rural constituencies which are traditionally conservative strongholds. Here he will deliver speeches highlighting the differences between himself and the current governing party, as well as stressing his commitment to protecting civil liberties and promoting freedom of speech. He will also be taking advantage of his visits to local communities to discuss key issues affecting them directly, such as education, healthcare and housing. 

Later this month, Sir Charles Kennedy will travel further south, visiting cities like Liverpool which are seen as particularly vulnerable to Labour's advances in recent years. Here too, he plans to use his platform to spread awareness of Liberal Democratic principles and explain why he believes they can better serve the needs of citizens than any other political party currently in power. In addition, he will seek to address concerns surrounding rising poverty levels and inequality through detailed discussions with constituents. 

Such activities form just one aspect of Sir Charles' overall strategy to increase Liberal Democrat popularity ahead of the election. Over the past few weeks, he has held rallies throughout the country to showcase his party's vision for Britain â€“ from improving access to affordable childcare, to reducing college tuition fees and providing free health care services for all. With the help of these initiatives, it looks likely that the Liberal Democrats stand a strong chance of making substantial progress in the upcoming general election.
