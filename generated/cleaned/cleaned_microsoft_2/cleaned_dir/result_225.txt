The Conservative party is facing allegations of Anti-semitism after their prospective candidate, Andrew Mennear released a post criticizing the recent Labour campaign. This came in response to a controversial election poster from the opposition party featuring former Prime Minister Michael Howard and current Cabinet member, Lord Letwin, depicted on wings like pigs. According to reports by several media outlets, including Sky News and The Telegraph, Mennear labelled this image “tasteless” and “offensive", stating that there was no doubt that such an approach would only serve to divide people further rather than bring them together. 
Mr Mennear went onto say he had been made aware of the issue through his constituents – many of whom were part of the local Jewish community located near Finchley. He urged all parties involved to show respect for each other's beliefs instead of resorting to tactics which may be seen as divisive or hateful. In addition, Mr Mennear highlighted the importance of having meaningful conversations between different sides in order to understand one another better.
His comments have been met with praise from within the community, while some have criticized what they see as insufficient action taken against such behavior during past campaigns. There are also concerns amongst certain sections regarding whether similar posters will continue being displayed at future events if left unchecked. It remains to be seen how this issue develops, but so far the conversation around it appears to be focused mainly on finding ways for dialogue among various political groups without any disrespect towards anyone's religion, race or culture.
