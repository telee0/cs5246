The United Kingdom (UK) and United States need to accept that some terrorism risks will remain uncontrollable, according to one expert. 
Amitai Etzioni, a renowned scholar who has had considerable impact in shaping post-9/11 policymaking at the British Labour Party, stated during his recent appearance before House Speaker John Boehner's committee on Homeland Security that it was essential for both nations understand that their ability to entirely prevent terrorist activities such as a nuclear attack remained limited. He added that the primary objective ought to shift from solely attempting to eradicate any form of terror threat towards ensuring that there is no possibility of them resulting in catastrophic nuclear warfare. This statement came amid growing tension between India and Pakistan over disputed territory which have recently escalated into open military conflict involving other regional powers like China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.
