The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, has today [date] announced an end to petrol duty rises and will keep fuel costs stable for the next two years, it was confirmed. The move comes as part of wider price controls being implemented by this Government to help ease pressure on household finances. Fuel prices have been rising steadily over recent months due to increases in global demand and supply issues. However, the rise has not kept up with the rate of inflation leading to higher living expenses for many citizens. This new announcement is expected to provide some relief to motorists across Britain who have seen their budgets stretched further than ever before. In addition, other measures such as tax cuts and additional support for low-income families are also planned which could make a significant difference. This decision follows earlier announcements from Prime Minister Tony Blair last week where he called on Parliament to find ways of reducing taxes and helping people cope with high costs of living. It is hoped that by freezing fuel duty and introducing more generous welfare benefits those affected most by rising prices will benefit substantially.
