The Liberal Democrats have released their list of targets for the upcoming general election, which includes a number of key Conservatives. At the head of this hitlist is former party leader and current Prime Minister, Boris Johnson's rival to become leader of the Conservative Party. Alongside him is the Shadow Home Secretary Amber Rudd as well as Foreign Office minister Stephen Pound. Both have been long-standing figures in British politics who will be fighting hard against each other for the position they both want.
