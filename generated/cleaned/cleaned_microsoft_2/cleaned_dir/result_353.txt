In an exclusive interview, Prime Minister David Cameron revealed his plans for a radical new approach to British politics. 
The Conservative Party leader said he wanted to make Britain's economic policies more focused on creating opportunities for individuals rather than simply redistributing wealth as had been done by past governments. Mr. Cameron argued that this would help reduce poverty and inequality across the country.

 “I want everyone to have access to the same chances to get ahead, no matter where they’re from or what their background is,” he told reporters during a press conference outside Downing Street. “We need to create a level playing field so people can take control of their own destiny."""
