The UK's youth population is increasingly taking an interest in political matters, as evidenced by new research from the Electoral Commission. 

A poll of 16 to 20 year olds revealed that 81% of individuals in this age group reported having a strong opinion on various issues such as crime and education policy. Moreover, over half of those surveyed showed a willingness to participate in direct action to make their voices heard. These results are particularly significant considering the current state of the political landscape in the United Kingdom.


Consider four hypothetical countries A, B, C, D. Each country has different levels of voter turnout amongst its youthful demographic aged between 18 - 25 years old (Youth). We know that: 
1) Country B has higher Youth Voter Turnout than Country D but lower than Country A.
2) Amongst the top three Countries with highest Youth voters' turnout; one ranks second and another rank third while remaining unknown which ranks first among them all.
3) Only two out of four given information can be true at once due to data limitations.
4) One of these countries did not reach 30%, 40%, or 50%. None reached more than 60%. 
5) In every single case, no two countries had the same percentage of Youth votes cast.
6) If Country Dâ€™s Youth Voter turnout was less than 40%, then either Country A or Country E would surpass it when comparing both of them together.
7) Either Country B surpassed both Country A and C combined or none of them passed each other except for one point.  
8) It is known that the sum of percentages of Country A and C cannot exceed 70%.
9) No Country exceeded 45%.   
10) At least one Country has 35% Youth vote.
11) Country A did not surpass 40%.  
12) There were only two countries where no matter what order they came in there never could have been a tie for any position above 15th place.

Question: Can you identify the respective rankings, minimum and maximum possible values within 5 points, and actual values if available?


From clue 4 we infer that the lowest number achieved must be 10 because no country surpassed 100%. From Clue 9 and 11, we understand Country A couldn't exceed 44%. So, the numbers for Countries A and B range between 14 and 54 inclusive. As per Clue 12, since no pair can achieve positions 1 through 6, A & C must occupy places 7 or 8. Considering Clue 3, if A = 56 and C= 48, then B > 58 which violates clue 2 thus forcing A < 52 and hence, C>50. Hence, A=52 and C=46.

Since A=52 and B>D based on Clue1, and since D<40 according to Clue 2(from step1),B must equal 53 leaving D as 41. This fulfills our conditions. Now, let's use proof by exhaustion here. Since only two out of five clues hold up under exhaustive analysis, let's test whether B is ranked first or third (according to the rules) along with determining the final ranking using inductive logic. Let's assume B is in last position (third), therefore C must take the first spot (since rule #7 says B topped some others). But this contradicts rule#12 which states no pairs can get the top three spots in a row unless one gets first. Thus B should come before C i.e., fourth and consequently, A should go after C so it takes the fifth spot. Therefore, C is first, followed by A in sixth and finally comes D who took seventh position.

Answer: The countries ordered in descending order based on their youth voter turnout are: C, A, E, B, D. With respect to the range mentioned earlier, the lowest value achievable is 46% and the largest possible is 57%. Given the specific percentages, C=51%, A=44%, B=48%, and D=41%.
