'Hague Given Up His Prime Minister Ambition' 
He had been trying since then, but it seemed that nothing could bring him success. He had come close many times, only to fall short in the end. Despite this, he refused to give up on his dream of one day becoming the UK's prime minister. 

The former Conservative leader had spent the last few years working tirelessly to promote himself as a viable candidate. He had attended countless rallies and debates, published several articles, and even reached out directly to voters. Yet despite his efforts, he never quite managed to capture enough support to make it past the first round of voting. 

It was during an interview with The Times newspaper earlier today that Mr. Hague finally made the announcement - he was giving up hope of ever being elected to the position of British PM. In his statement, the former Conservative Party chairman said that while he still believed in public service and wanted to do whatever he could to help improve the nation's fortunes, pursuing a political career no longer felt like the right path for him. 

''I have enjoyed doing what I've done so far, and if there is something else that calls to me then perhaps I should pursue that,'' he said. ''But at this point, looking back over my work and all that has gone before, I cannot see how I can make any significant difference from within government.'' 

His decision comes amid mounting pressure on the Conservative Party following their dismal performance in recent general elections. With little chance of reclaiming power anytime soon, many observers believe that the current crop of Conservative MPs are unlikely to secure another victory until 2025 or later. It seems clear that Mr. Hague knows full well just how difficult such a feat would be. 

Despite his resignation, however, it remains unclear exactly when and where Mr. Hague plans to take his next step. All we know for certain is that, for once, he is willing to admit that some things simply aren't meant to be. Perhaps this marks the beginning of a new chapter in his life â€“ and who knows? Maybe someday, against all odds, he'll get his wish and become Britain's next Prime Minister.'
