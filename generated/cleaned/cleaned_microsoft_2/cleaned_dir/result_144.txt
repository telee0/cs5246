- Labour has been heavily criticized for their lack of transparency and dishonesty in promoting the European Union (EU). The opposition party, led by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, has accused them of using taxpayer money as a tool for propaganda. They claim that the government's recent release of a white paper detailing its plans for the future relationship between Britain and Europe, including membership in various institutions such as NATO and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, is nothing more than an attempt to mislead the voters before the upcoming referendum on the proposed EU Constitution.
