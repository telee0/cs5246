In an exclusive interview, former British Prime Minister Michael Howard revealed yesterday that he once skipped classes as a child. According to reports from The Sun, Howard spent most of his early days skipping class to hang out with some old schoolmates who played snooker. Despite admitting this habit caused “lasting harm”, the former MP maintained that it didn't have too much impact on his life or career.
 
When asked how truancy affected his education during those years, Howard responded by saying that while playing truant for leisure activities may sound harmless today, back then it wasn't seen so positively. He noted that schools were stricter than they are now when dealing with students missing lessons and that taking time off would be frowned upon even if there's no intention to skip ahead of course material entirely. In fact, Howard stated that strict actions should be taken against anyone caught breaking attendance rules - especially if their behavior becomes habitual over time (see full text below).


Based on the information provided above, consider three hypothetical political figures named A, B, C representing different parties. Each party is trying to pass new legislation related to truancy laws which includes harsh penalties similar to what Howard described. Party A argues that such measures will ensure student discipline; Party B emphasizes public safety concerns regarding unsupervised youths; Party C insists that educational disruption needs to be minimized through other means like counseling rather than punishment. Given these perspectives, each figure must decide whether their proposed legislation aligns more closely with Howard's views expressed earlier in the piece. Your task is to assign one figure (A,B,C) to either support or oppose Howard's statement based solely on their arguments without directly referring to the statements made by Howard himself.

Question: Which political figure do you think supports/opposes Howard's view? Explain your reasoning.


First, analyze each argument presented by each figure. 
Party A argues for increased disciplinary actions implying that Howard might agree considering his belief towards strict enforcement of attendance regulations regardless of intent causing long-term damage according to his own account. This suggests that Figure A agrees with Howard. 
On the contrary, both B and C argue against punitive measures, emphasizing rehabilitation efforts instead which contradicts Howard's emphasis on immediate corrective actions for repeated violations leading to significant disruptions. Thus, neither B nor C could possibly agree with Howard. 

By process of elimination using proof by exhaustion, we can conclude that only Party A's viewpoint corresponds exactly to the content shared by Howard, making them supportive of his opinion.  
Answer: Political figure A opposes Howard's view given that their stance matches precisely Howard's beliefs outlined previously.
