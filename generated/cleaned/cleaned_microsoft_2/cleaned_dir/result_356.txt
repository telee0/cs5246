In the world today, politicians have been facing an increasing pressure due to various issues such as economic instability, social unrest, and political corruption. The public's trust in their government has reached record lows, leading many people to believe that they need someone fresh and innovative to restore faith in the democratic process. One man who is determined to make this happen is Robert Kilroy-Silk, the former BBC Radio 4 presenter and UKIP member turned independent candidate running for office under the newly established Veritas party. 
Robert Kilroy-Silk believes that our current system is broken, and it needs a complete overhaul. As he explains on his official website, "Our country is being stolen from us by mass migration and unchecked bureaucracy." He sees himself not only as a politician but also as an agent of change. His goal is to transform Britain into a more transparent, accountable, and prosperous nation where every citizen can thrive. To achieve this vision, Kilroy-Silk intends to focus on several key areas during his campaign.
