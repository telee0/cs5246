The row over 'Police Power' for Civil Society Organisations, or CSOs as they are often referred to, has once again taken centre stage. In a recent statement from The Police Federation, their opposition to granting community support officers, commonly known as CSOs, the ability to hold individuals suspected of committing offences for up to thirty minutes was made clear. This new extension of such powers, which had already been piloted in six different regions across England and Wales before being implemented nationwide on Thurs., has come under fire yet again.
