"The upcoming national elections offer a crucial moment for political parties to choose their paths. With an increasing number of Americans feeling disenfranchised by both major candidates, it has never been more important for voters to make informed decisions based on what each candidate is offering. 
	The Republican and Democratic parties have spent the past few months campaigning on different platforms, and politicians from both sides have tried to articulate their visions for the country's future. The Republican platform focuses on reducing government regulation and promoting individual responsibility, while the Democratic platform stresses taking action to combat climate change and investing in public services. 
	The American people are divided as to which path is best for the nation, but they should remember that their ultimate decision does not solely depend on the two main contenders. Other minor parties like the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the Constitution Party present alternatives to consider when making their vote. 
	In addition to the current candidates, voters should take time to learn about the lesser-known issues affecting their state or region, such as healthcare, education, and job growth. It is only through being educated and engaged that citizens can ensure their voices are heard. 
	Ultimately, the 2012 elections give us an opportunity to shape the direction of the country. To accomplish this, voters must weigh all options and make choices based on what is truly best for America."
