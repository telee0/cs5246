Government urged to make adult maths and literacy courses more attractive to hit targets
A recent report has highlighted the importance of making adult maths and literacy courses more engaging in order for the government to reach its target for improving skills in these areas. The National Audit Office has commended ministers for successfully reaching the milestone of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. However, in order to continue making progress, it is crucial that courses are made more appealing to adult learners. The report suggests that by making courses more attractive, the government can ensure that more adults are motivated to participate and ultimately improve their maths and literacy skills. This can have a positive impact on overall educational attainment and workforce productivity. It is clear that in order to achieve their goals, the government must prioritize making adult education courses more engaging and effective.
