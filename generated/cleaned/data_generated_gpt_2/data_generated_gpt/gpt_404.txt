Former Labour MP George Galloway Calls for Release of Kidnapped Aid Worker Margaret Hassan in Iraq
Former Labour MP George Galloway has made a passionate plea for the immediate release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, who was kidnapped in Iraq. Mrs. Hassan, 59, was leading operations for Care International in Iraq when she was abducted in Baghdad on October 19. Galloway, known for his outspoken views on international affairs, expressed deep concern for Hassan's safety and urged her captors to release her unharmed. The kidnapping of Mrs. Hassan has sparked international outrage and calls for her swift and safe return. Galloway's appeal comes amid a growing concern for the safety of aid workers in conflict zones, as their work becomes increasingly dangerous and fraught with risk. The abduction of Margaret Hassan serves as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by humanitarian workers in war-torn regions. Galloway's plea for her release highlights the urgent need for increased protection and support for those who dedicate their lives to helping others in need. The international community must come together to ensure the safe return of Margaret Hassan and all other aid workers who are at risk of harm while carrying out their vital work.
