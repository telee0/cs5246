Michael Howard Woos Britain's Ethnic Vote
In a bold move, Michael Howard is reaching out to Britain's ethnic communities, urging them to vote Conservative in the upcoming election. He believes that many people in these communities feel neglected and taken for granted by Tony Blair, and he wants to assure them that the Conservative party shares the same values as the UK's minorities. Howard will emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusivity within the Conservative party and will highlight the contributions that ethnic communities have made to British society. By making this pitch, Howard hopes to win over the support of a significant portion of the electorate and demonstrate that the Conservative party is committed to representing the interests of all British citizens, regardless of their background.
