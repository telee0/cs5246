Britain pledges £4m grant to support women survivors of Rwandan genocide
In a show of solidarity and support, Britain has announced a £4m grant to aid women survivors of the Rwandan genocide who were subjected to horrific acts of rape and intentional transmission of HIV/Aids. It is estimated that during the 1994 genocide, around 25,000 girls and women fell victim to these brutal crimes. The grant from Britain will be instrumental in providing much-needed assistance and resources to help these survivors rebuild their lives and heal from the trauma they endured. This gesture of compassion and aid showcases the commitment of the international community to stand with the survivors of one of the darkest chapters in Rwandan history.
