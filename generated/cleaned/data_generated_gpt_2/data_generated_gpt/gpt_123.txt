Tony Blair's comeback and the mood at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead
Tony Blair has declared to Labour supporters that he is 'back' and still eager for the role of prime minister. But is this sentiment reflective of the overall mood at the party's spring conference in Gateshead? Graham Lane, leader of the Labour group on Newham Council, has offered a more realistic perspective, noting that the electorate seems to be more supportive of the government than some members of the Labour Party. This raises questions about the current state of the party and its prospects for future success. Blair's return to the spotlight has certainly sparked a renewed interest in Labour politics, but whether this enthusiasm will translate into electoral victories remains to be seen.
