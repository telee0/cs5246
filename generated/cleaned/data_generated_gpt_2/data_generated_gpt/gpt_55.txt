A British MP, Quentin Davies, representing Grantham and Stamford, was recently the victim of a mugging in a park in Nairobi, Kenya. The incident occurred when Davies was approached by a group of six men who proceeded to steal over Â£600 in cash and his passport. The park where the robbery took place is known for being a dangerous area in the capital city. The MP was left shaken but fortunately did not sustain any physical harm in the attack.
