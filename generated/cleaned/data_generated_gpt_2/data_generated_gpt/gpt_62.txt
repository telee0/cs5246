British voters likely to reject European constitution by two to one
A recent poll conducted by The Daily Telegraph indicates that British voters are overwhelmingly likely to reject the European constitution by a margin of two to one. According to the poll results, 45% of respondents stated that they would vote against the constitution, while only 24% expressed support for it. This stark contrast in opinions suggests that the government's proposed question on the constitution may face strong opposition from the public. The results of the poll highlight a significant divide among British voters on the issue of European integration and the country's relationship with the European Union. The findings also point to a growing skepticism and discontent among the electorate towards the EU and its policies. The poll results are likely to have significant implications for the upcoming referendum on the European constitution, as they indicate a clear majority of voters are opposed to the proposed changes. The government will need to address these concerns and engage with the public in order to win support for the constitution. The rejection of the European constitution by British voters could have far-reaching consequences for the country's future relationship with the EU and its role in European politics. It remains to be seen how the government will respond to the poll results and whether they will take steps to address the concerns of the electorate. The divide among British voters on the issue of the European constitution reflects broader debates and tensions within the country over issues of sovereignty, immigration, and national identity. The results of the poll suggest that these issues are likely to play a key role in shaping the outcome of the referendum on the constitution. In conclusion, the poll results indicate that British voters are likely to reject the European constitution by a significant margin, highlighting the deep divisions and skepticism within the electorate towards the EU and its policies.
