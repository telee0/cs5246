Tory Co-chairman accuses Tony Blair of lying in election campaign
The Tories are accusing former Prime Minister Tony Blair of lying during the election campaign, citing his history of dishonesty in taking the UK to war. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox spoke out against Blair after the former PM criticized the Tories for their supposed 'hard right agenda'. Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq War on false pretenses, is now facing criticism for his tactics in the election. Fox argued that Blair's willingness to deceive the public in the past raises doubts about his honesty in the current campaign. The accusations highlight the contentious nature of the election, with both sides trading barbs and accusations. The Tories are positioning themselves as the party of truth and integrity, contrasting themselves with Blair's alleged deceits. This latest clash between the parties serves as a reminder of the high stakes and intense competition in UK politics.
