Former Home Office Minister Calls for Independent Immigration Monitoring Body
Barbara Roche, a former Home Office minister, has proposed the establishment of an independent organization to oversee and report on UK immigration. Roche emphasized that this monitoring body should be separate from the government in order to ensure transparency and accountability. She stressed the importance of having accurate and reliable figures on immigration, which can only be achieved through an independent entity. Roche's call for an independent immigration monitoring body comes at a time of increasing scrutiny and debate over immigration policies in the UK. The establishment of such a body could provide valuable insights and data to inform policy decisions and public discourse on immigration issues. It remains to be seen whether Roche's proposal will be taken up by the government and implemented in the near future.
