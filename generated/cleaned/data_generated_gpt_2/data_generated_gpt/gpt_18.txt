Frustration and anger over the sharp increase in council tax bills in 2003 prompted widespread protests across England. The average bill saw a staggering 12.9% increase, prompting outrage among residents who were already struggling to make ends meet. Pensioners were particularly affected by the hikes, with many taking to the streets in protest.
