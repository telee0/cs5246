In a speech addressing the aftermath of George W Bush's re-election, Mr Kennedy highlighted Iraq as a breeding ground for militant terrorism. He emphasized the urgency of establishing a proper exit strategy to bring an end to the conflict and instability in the region. The UK's involvement in Iraq has been a contentious issue, with many questioning the effectiveness of the military intervention and the lack of a coherent plan for withdrawal.

With the upcoming elections in Iraq set to shape the country's future, the pressure is on for world leaders to devise a strategy that will lead to a sustainable peace.

Mr Kennedy's call for a proper exit strategy is a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring a responsible and effective resolution to the conflict in Iraq. The upcoming elections in Iraq present an opportunity for the international community to reevaluate its approach to the region and work towards a more stable and secure future for the people of Iraq. It is imperative that Tony Blair and other world leaders take heed of Mr Kennedy's call and prioritize the development of a comprehensive and sustainable exit strategy from Iraq.
