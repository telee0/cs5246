Government considers tagging parents who refuse child contact with former partners
Ministers are considering implementing electronic tagging for parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children, according to Lord Falconer. In addition to tagging, curfews and community service orders are also being considered as potential consequences for defying court orders to allow parental access. Lord Falconer stated that these measures are being explored as a means of ensuring compliance with custody agreements and prioritizing the best interests of the children involved.
