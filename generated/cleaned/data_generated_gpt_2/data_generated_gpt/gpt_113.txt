Tory leader Michael Howard accuses Tony Blair of flip-flopping on self defence laws
In a recent statement, Tory leader Michael Howard has criticized Prime Minister Tony Blair for his apparent change in stance regarding the rules on using force against burglars. Howard accused Blair of performing U-turns on this issue, highlighting the government's decision to rule out any amendments to the current law, which permits the use of 'reasonable force' in self defence. The controversy stems from Blair's prior support for tougher measures on burglary and home invasion, leading many to question his commitment to protecting citizens and their property. This shift in position has raised concerns among both political opponents and the public, with many calling for clarity and consistency in the government's approach to tackling crime. Howard's criticism reflects a broader debate on the balance between individual rights and public safety, as well as the role of the state in regulating use of force in self defence situations. The ongoing disagreement between Howard and Blair underscores the complexity of the issue and the challenges of finding a comprehensive solution that satisfies all parties involved. As the debate continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the government will address these concerns and ensure that the law on self defence reflects the values and priorities of the British people.
