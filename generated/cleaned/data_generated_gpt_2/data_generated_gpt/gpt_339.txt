Labour and Conservatives Continue Phone Campaigns Amidst Marketing Cold Call Concerns
Labour and the Conservatives are currently engaged in telephone campaigns, reaching out to the millions of individuals who have registered to prevent receiving marketing 'cold calls'. Both parties have assured the public that they are strictly adhering to regulations by ensuring that their calls are not marketing in nature. One way they are achieving this is by inquiring about individuals' voting intentions during the calls. Despite concerns about potential breaches of privacy, the parties are determined to maintain communication with their constituents through these telephone campaigns.
