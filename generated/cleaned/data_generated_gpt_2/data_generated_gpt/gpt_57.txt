Report suggests cutting drink-drive limits could save more lives than previously thought
A new report from University College London suggests that cutting drink-drive limits by a third could save more lives than previously estimated. The research indicates that reducing the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg could prevent 65 deaths annually. This finding highlights the potential benefits of implementing stricter regulations to address the issue of drunk driving and improve road safety. By taking action to lower the legal alcohol limit for drivers, policymakers have the opportunity to significantly reduce the number of fatalities caused by alcohol-related accidents. The study's results underscore the importance of considering evidence-based measures to protect public health and save lives on the road.
