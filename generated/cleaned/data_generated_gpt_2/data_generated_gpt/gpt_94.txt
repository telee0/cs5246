Tory Leader Michael Howard Dismisses Claims of Immigration Policy Convergence with BNP
Tory leader Michael Howard has rejected accusations that his immigration policy mirrors that of the British National Party (BNP). In response to claims made by BNP leader Nick Griffin that some BNP voters may switch to the Tories due to the issue, Howard has stated that his party's stance on immigration is not a reflection of the extreme views held by the BNP. Howard emphasized that the Conservative Party's approach to immigration is based on fairness, security, and upholding the rule of law, rather than the divisive and xenophobic rhetoric often espoused by the BNP. The Tory leader reiterated that the Conservatives are committed to managing immigration in a way that is both effective and compassionate, while also ensuring that British values and sovereignty are protected. Howard's firm dismissal of any convergence between the Tory immigration policy and that of the BNP underscores the stark differences in ideology and approach between the two parties. Despite Griffin's assertions, it is clear that the Conservative Party under Howard's leadership remains steadfast in its commitment to a pragmatic and responsible approach to immigration that is in line with mainstream British values and principles.
