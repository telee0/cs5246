Conservatives propose TB and HIV tests for non-EU citizens wanting to work in the UK
The Conservatives have proposed that non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). A positive test for TB would result in visa applications being denied, while cases of HIV would be handled on an individual basis. This move has sparked debate among politicians and the public, with some arguing that it is discriminatory and unnecessary, while others believe it is a necessary measure to protect public health. The Conservatives have defended their proposal, stating that it is aimed at safeguarding the health of UK residents and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential impact on individuals who may be denied entry to the UK based on their health status. The Department of Health and Social Care is set to implement the new testing requirements, which are expected to come into effect in the near future. Overall, the proposal has ignited discussions about immigration policy, public health, and the rights of non-EU citizens seeking employment in the UK.
