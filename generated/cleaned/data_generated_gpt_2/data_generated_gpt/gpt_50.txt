Deadline for Voter Registration in the UK General Election
As the anticipated general election draws near, residents in England, Scotland, and Wales were required to have completed their voter registration by 1700 GMT today in order to be eligible to vote on 5 May. Those who had previously submitted their registration forms last autumn should already be included on the voter register. However, individuals who have recently relocated or were away on vacation during the registration period may have inadvertently been left off the list. It is crucial for all eligible voters to ensure their registration is up to date to exercise their democratic right in the upcoming election.
