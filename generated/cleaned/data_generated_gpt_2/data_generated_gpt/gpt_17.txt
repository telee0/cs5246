Government announces expansion of special help to combat anti-social behaviour in England and Wales
Fifty new areas in England and Wales will be receiving special assistance in their efforts to combat anti-social behaviour, with the government set to announce the list of locations on Thursday. Following the success of the program in ten initial areas, which saw a reduction in anti-social behaviour thanks to the deployment of special prosecutors and local experts, the government has decided to expand the initiative to more towns and cities. This move comes as part of a broader crackdown on anti-social behaviour across the country, as authorities aim to make communities safer and more secure for residents.
