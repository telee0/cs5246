Proposed Plan to Electronically Tag Parents who Refuse Contact with Children
The government is considering a plan to electronically tag parents who refuse to allow their former partners to have contact with their children, according to Lord Falconer. The proposal would also include the option of imposing curfews and community service orders on parents who defy court orders to allow parental access. Lord Falconer emphasized the importance of ensuring that children have meaningful relationships with both parents, even after a relationship has ended. This plan is aimed at holding parents accountable for their actions and ensuring that children are not unfairly deprived of contact with one of their parents. The idea of electronically tagging parents in such situations has sparked debate and controversy, with some arguing that it is a necessary step to enforce court orders and protect the rights of children, while others raise concerns about privacy and civil liberties. However, Lord Falconer defended the proposal, stating that it is a necessary measure to ensure that parents comply with court orders and prioritize the well-being of their children. In addition to electronic tagging, curfews and community service orders are being considered as alternative measures to be imposed on parents who refuse to allow parental contact. These options are intended to provide consequences for non-compliance with court orders and to encourage parents to prioritize the best interests of their children. The government is expected to continue discussions and consultations on the proposed plan, with the goal of implementing measures that will effectively address parental refusal to allow contact with children and protect the rights of all parties involved.
