Tony Blair calls on Ken Livingstone to apologise for 'Nazi' comment
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called on London mayor Ken Livingstone to issue an apology for his recent controversial comments towards a Jewish reporter. The Labour politician accused the journalist of behaving like a 'Nazi concentration camp guard', a remark that has sparked outrage and condemnation from various community groups. Despite facing backlash from all sides, Livingstone has refused to retract his statement and insists that he is 'standing by' his words. Blair, along with many other prominent figures, has criticized Livingstone's inflammatory language, calling it divisive and unacceptable. The incident has reignited debates about the boundaries of free speech and the need for politicians to be held accountable for their words. Some have argued that Livingstone's comparison trivializes the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, while others defend his right to express his opinions freely. As the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether Livingstone will heed calls for an apology and take steps to mend relations with the Jewish community.
