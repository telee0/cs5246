Information Commissioner Demands Details of Cabinet Office Orders to Delete E-mails
The Information Commissioner has expressed his urgency in requesting details of Cabinet Office orders instructing staff to delete e-mails that are more than three months old. Richard Thomas has strongly criticized the deletion of e-mails as a means to avoid their disclosure under the upcoming freedom of information laws that will be enforced on 1 January. Thomas has emphasized his total condemnation of such actions, stating that it goes against the principles of transparency and accountability. He has called for transparency regarding the motives behind the orders to delete e-mails, as this could potentially hinder the public's right to access information. The Information Commissioner's office is actively seeking clarification on the reasoning behind the directive to delete e-mails and is determined to hold those responsible to account. Thomas has stressed the importance of upholding the integrity of the freedom of information laws and ensuring that information is not deliberately withheld from the public. The deletion of e-mails could be seen as an attempt to conceal information that may be deemed embarrassing or damaging to the government. This raises concerns about the government's commitment to transparency and accountability, especially as the deadline for the implementation of the freedom of information laws draws near. The Information Commissioner's office is working diligently to uncover the extent of the deletion of e-mails and is committed to safeguarding the public's right to access information. Thomas has reiterated his firm stance against any attempts to evade transparency and has vowed to take swift action against any parties found to be involved in the deletion of e-mails. The public's right to access information is a fundamental aspect of a democratic society, and any actions that undermine this right are a cause for concern. The Information Commissioner's office will continue to investigate the matter and will not hesitate to enforce the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the freedom of information laws. The government's transparency and accountability are at stake, and it is crucial that all parties involved in the deletion of e-mails are held accountable for their actions. As the deadline for the enforcement of the freedom of information laws approaches, the public's right to access information must be upheld and protected at all costs.
