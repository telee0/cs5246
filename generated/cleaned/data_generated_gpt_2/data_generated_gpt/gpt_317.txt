Middlesbrough Mayor Ray Mallon boosts Yes campaign in North East assembly referendum
Middlesbrough mayor Ray Mallon, known for his tough stance on crime, has joined the Yes campaign in the North East assembly referendum as it enters its last week. Mallon, a former police chief who earned the nickname Robocop for his zero tolerance approach, clashed with Sunderland No campaigner Neil Herron during a heated exchange on Thursday. Mallon has been brought in to drum up support for the Yes campaign, which seeks to establish a regional assembly in the North East. The referendum has divided opinion, with opponents arguing that it would be an unnecessary layer of government and a waste of taxpayer money. Supporters, however, believe that a regional assembly would provide more localized decision-making and greater representation for the North East. Mallon's presence on the Yes campaign trail is seen as a boost for the pro-assembly camp, given his reputation for being tough on crime and his track record of getting things done. The former police chief has always been a controversial figure, but his no-nonsense approach has won him many supporters over the years. Mallon's endorsement of the Yes campaign is likely to sway undecided voters who may be on the fence about the proposed assembly. The North East assembly referendum has been a hotly debated topic in the region, with both sides campaigning hard to win over voters. Mallon's involvement in the campaign adds a new dimension to the debate, as his reputation for being tough on crime could help to sway undecided voters in favor of the Yes camp. With just a week left until the referendum, both sides are pulling out all the stops to secure a win. Mallon's presence on the campaign trail is sure to inject some energy into the final push for votes. The outcome of the referendum remains uncertain, but with Mallon on board, the Yes campaign has certainly gained a formidable ally in its bid to establish a regional assembly in the North East.
