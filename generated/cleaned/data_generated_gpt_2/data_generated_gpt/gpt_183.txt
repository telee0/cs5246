MPs and Peers Warn of Shocking Levels of Deaths in Custody
A committee of MPs and peers have raised concerns over the alarming number of deaths in custody, describing the situation as 'shocking'. According to the joint committee on human rights, the individuals who have taken their own lives while in custody were often the most vulnerable, with issues such as mental health disorders, substance abuse or alcohol dependency. The committee highlighted the need for improved support and intervention for these individuals to prevent further tragedies from occurring. The report also emphasized the importance of addressing systemic issues within the criminal justice system that may contribute to these deaths. This includes ensuring that adequate mental health services are available to those in custody, as well as implementing measures to reduce the prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse among inmates. The committee's findings have sparked calls for urgent action to prevent future deaths in custody and protect the rights and well-being of all individuals within the criminal justice system. The report has prompted a renewed focus on the need for greater accountability and transparency in the management of individuals in custody, as well as the importance of recognizing and addressing the underlying factors that may contribute to these tragic outcomes. The committee's recommendations are seen as a crucial step towards addressing the root causes of deaths in custody and ensuring that all individuals are provided with the appropriate care and support to prevent further loss of life.
