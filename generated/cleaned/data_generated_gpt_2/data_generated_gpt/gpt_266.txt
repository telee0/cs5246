MPs banned from using Blackberries in the Commons chamber
Speaker Michael Martin has stated that Members of Parliament will face expulsion from the House of Commons if they are caught using Blackberries during sessions. The handheld devices, which cost around Â£200, have the capability to function as a phone, pager, or email device. Speaker Michael Martin has made it clear that the use of Blackberries in the chamber is strictly prohibited and any member found violating this rule will be removed from the premises. This decision has been made in order to maintain decorum and ensure that MPs are fully focused on the discussions and debates taking place in the chamber. The ruling comes as part of a larger effort to modernize and regulate the use of technology within the parliamentary setting. Blackberries have become increasingly popular among politicians as a means of staying connected and accessing information on-the-go. However, the potential for distractions and disruptions caused by these devices has led to the decision to ban their use in the Commons chamber. This ruling may prompt MPs to reconsider their reliance on Blackberries and find alternative ways of staying connected and informed while in parliament. Speaker Michael Martin's decision to enforce this ban reflects the desire to uphold the professionalism and integrity of parliamentary proceedings. As technology continues to evolve, it is important for rules and regulations to adapt in order to maintain the standards of behavior expected from Members of Parliament. The ban on Blackberries in the Commons chamber serves as a reminder that MPs are held to a high standard of conduct and are expected to prioritize their responsibilities as elected officials. Moving forward, it will be essential for MPs to adhere to this ruling and find alternative methods of communication and information-sharing while in the chamber. The enforcement of this ban underscores the importance of maintaining focus and attention during parliamentary sessions, and reinforces the notion that MPs must prioritize their duties and obligations as representatives of the people.
