In recent news, the topic of abortion has once again come under the spotlight, with Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman setting out his views on the issue. This comes after the top Catholic in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, supported Michael Howard's stance on reducing the legal limit for abortions.

In an interview with BBC Radio Four's Sunday programme, the cardinal stated that he believes there should be a reduction in the legal limit from the current 24 weeks to 20 weeks. He also criticised the government's stance on the issue, calling it "tantamount to abortion on demand". This statement sparked controversy and debate within the political world, as well as among religious leaders.

Michael Howard has long been an advocate for stricter abortion laws, arguing that the current limits are too lenient and lead to too many unborn babies being killed. He has called for a complete ban on abortion, but this position has been met with opposition from many pro-choice advocates who argue that women have the right to make their own choices regarding their bodies and reproductive health.

Tony Blair has previously expressed his support for a reduction in the legal limit, stating that he wants to see fewer abortions take place. However, he has stopped short of supporting a total ban, instead opting for a more moderate approach. His spokesman recently clarified his stance on the issue, stating that the prime minister believes that while women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, this choice should not come at the expense of innocent human life.

This latest development in the abortion debate highlights the complex and divisive nature of the issue. While some people believe that a woman's rights must always trump any concerns for the unborn, others feel that there should be greater restrictions on abortion to protect the sanctity of life. As politicians continue to grapple with this issue, it will likely remain a contentious topic in the years to come.
