During his tour, he plans to visit an HIV/AIDS orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique to gain firsthand knowledge of the challenges faced by these communities. Afterward, he will chair a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town where he intends to discuss ways of addressing these issues on a broader scale.

The UK government has been actively working to improve the living conditions of people affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa. The visit to the orphanage in Tanzania is expected to shed light on the difficulties faced by children who have lost one or both parents due to the disease. Meanwhile, the women's credit union in Mozambique is seen as a model for financial inclusion that can help lift millions out of poverty.

By focusing on these issues, Mr Brown hopes to demonstrate the UK's commitment towards finding lasting solutions to Africa's problems. His visit to South Africa is also significant as it marks the beginning of the country's transformation into a prosperous democracy. With the G8 summit taking place later this year, Mr Brown's trip is likely to set the tone for the discussions that will take place in London.
