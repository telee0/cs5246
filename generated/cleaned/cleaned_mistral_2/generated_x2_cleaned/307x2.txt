The former minister for industry, trade and agriculture, expressed frustration that the party had not done enough to address issues such as immigration and poverty in Britain, stating: "The party is losing touch with reality and failing to listen to people's concerns."

In a press conference held earlier this morning, Jackson stated his reasons for leaving the party, which included his disappointment with the party's stance on Brexit and other key political issues. He also criticized the government's handling of the Iraq War, stating that it had been a major mistake that had led to countless deaths and destabilization of the Middle East region.

Blair responded to Jackson's announcement with an official statement, expressing gratitude for his service and contributions to the party over the years. He added that while he regretted their disagreements, he understood Jackson's decision and hoped that they could remain friends. However, the prime minister made it clear that he would continue to push forward with the government's policies without any interference from Jackson or other defectors.

Meanwhile, many members of the public reacted positively to Jackson's announcement, praising him for taking a stand against what they saw as a flawed government. Some even called for more politicians to follow suit, arguing that it was time for new blood and fresh perspectives to take charge of political affairs.

As the debate rages on about Jackson's departure, one thing remains clear - the UK political landscape has become increasingly polarized, with no end in sight. Only time will tell how things unfold, but one thing is certain - change is coming.
