The event, organized by campaign group “Campaign for Borders Rail” is expected to draw hundreds of people who support the restoration of the historic railway line that once ran between Edinburgh and the English border towns.

The SNP has been pushing hard for the restoration of the line, arguing that it would bring economic benefits to the region and boost tourism. Ms. Sturgeon, in particular, has been vocal in her support for the cause, stating that the restoration of the line would be an important step towards creating a more interconnected and sustainable transport network for Scotland.

Ms. Borthwick, who leads the Campaign for Borders Rail, said she was delighted that the SNP leaders had agreed to take part in the event and hoped that their support would help push the case forward for restoring the line. She also expressed optimism that the day would see significant progress made towards the goal of bringing back this iconic piece of Scottish history.

“This anniversary marks 36 years since the Waverley Line closed down, but we refuse to let its memory fade away,” Ms. Borthwick said. “Reopening the line would not only restore our connection to the south, but it would also bring back jobs, investment, and tourists to our region.”

The Waverley Line closure came after decades of use and neglect, with many blaming poor management for its ultimate demise. However, supporters have long argued that the line played a crucial role in connecting Scotland with England and helped shape the country’s identity.

As the debate continues, politicians across the political spectrum have shown their support for the restoration of the line, including Conservative leader Theresa May and Labour MP Ian Murray. While there is still much work to be done before the line can be reopened, the commemorative event is seen as a positive step towards achieving that goal.
