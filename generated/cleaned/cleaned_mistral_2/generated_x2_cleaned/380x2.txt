The UK's minimum wage is set for a rise next month, bringing it up to £7.38 per hour. This increase has been recommended by the Low Pay Commission (LPC), which also suggested that adults aged between 18 and 21 should be paid a higher rate of £4.95 an hour. These changes are expected to benefit millions of low-paid workers across the country.

Minimum wage laws have been in place in the UK for over two decades now, but their impact on employment has been subject to much debate. While proponents argue that these policies help to reduce poverty and improve living standards, critics warn that they can hurt businesses, particularly smaller ones.

One thing that is clear, however, is that many people still struggle to make ends meet even when working full time at the minimum wage. According to recent data, more than 2 million workers earn less than the living wage, which is currently £8.30 per hour in London and £7.38 elsewhere. Even those earning above the minimum wage may not necessarily be able to afford basic necessities such as housing, food and healthcare.

In light of this issue, the government recently announced plans to phase out Universal Credit – a controversial welfare scheme designed to replace traditional benefits like unemployment allowance – and introduce a new Universal Support system instead. Under this system, all eligible claimants would receive £60 per week regardless of whether or not they work. Critics argue that this approach could discourage people from seeking work altogether, while others believe it is necessary given current economic conditions.

Despite concerns about the potential impact on businesses and job growth, there is widespread support for raising the minimum wage among both employers and employees alike. In fact, a survey conducted earlier this year found that almost three quarters (71%) of small business owners supported increasing the national living wage, while nearly half (48%) of young workers aged 18-24 said they would prefer a higher salary over lower taxes.

However, some industry groups have warned that a significant increase in wages could lead to price hikes and reduced profits for companies. For example, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has called for caution when setting future minimum wage rates, arguing that any sudden spike could harm consumer confidence and lead to job losses in the retail sector.

As the debate continues, one thing remains certain: the minimum wage will continue to play a key role in shaping UK labour market policy in the years ahead. Whether it leads to increased inequality or helps to lift millions out of poverty, its effects will undoubtedly ripple through society for generations to come.

The United Kingdom has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of children under five dying each day, thanks to improved access to medical care. According to new data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), just 21 babies died every day last year – down from 27 deaths in 2015. Over the past decade, the rate of infant mortality has fallen by almost 40%.

Experts attribute this decline largely to advances in neonatal medicine and improvements in hospital care, which have allowed doctors to treat previously life-threatening conditions more effectively. Additionally, increased public awareness about healthy lifestyles and safer sleeping practices has helped to prevent accidents and illnesses that can contribute to sudden deaths in infancy.

While progress has been made, however, there are still disparities in infant mortality rates depending on where you live. For instance, areas in the north of England generally have higher death rates than those in the south. Furthermore, some ethnic groups, such as black Africans and Pakistanis, face higher risks due to factors like prematurity and low birth weight.

To address these issues, the government has launched several initiatives aimed
