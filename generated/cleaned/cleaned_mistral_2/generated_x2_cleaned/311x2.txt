In a significant development, five major public sector unions have announced that they will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labor's upcoming spring conference in Gateshead. The purpose of these discussions is to discuss the government's controversial plans to introduce new regulations that could raise the pension age for local authority employees from 60 to 65.

The union leaders expressed their concerns over the potential increase in pension ages and its impact on the well-being of public sector staff. In addition, they highlighted the importance of maintaining fair pensions policies across all sectors and urged the government to reconsider its decision.

"We believe that raising the pension age for council workers will not only harm their retirement prospects but also undermine morale and productivity in the public sector," said one of the union leaders. "It is our hope that through constructive dialogue, we can find an amicable solution that takes into account the needs and interests of both employees and employers."

Prescott has previously stated his commitment to finding solutions to issues facing public sector workers, including pensions reform. However, critics argue that such changes may lead to further cost cuts and reduced services for citizens.

Meanwhile, opposition parties called for transparency and openness in the negotiations between the unions and the government. "It is important that any decisions made regarding pensions are subject to scrutiny and public input," said a spokesperson for the Conservative Party.

As the debate continues, it remains uncertain whether the government will back down from its plans or if the unions will ultimately agree to support them. One thing is certain though: the future of public sector pensions policy is set to be a hotly contested issue in the months ahead.
