During his recent tour of African nations, Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for urgent action to be taken in order to achieve the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and reducing child mortality rates. In a speech delivered in [City/Country], Mr Brown emphasized the importance of meeting these targets and urged world leaders to take immediate steps towards achieving them.

The Prime Minister's call for action comes as he returns from a visit to several African countries where he witnessed firsthand the impact that poverty and lack of healthcare can have on children and families. During his trip, Mr Brown visited schools, hospitals, and community centers in countries such as [Countries] to see how progress was being made in improving living conditions and access to education and medical care.

Mr Brown also met with local leaders and international organizations to discuss ways to increase funding for programs aimed at addressing poverty and disease.

"We cannot afford to ignore the plight of those who are suffering due to poverty and poor health," said Mr Brown. "As leaders, it is our responsibility to take action and do everything we can to help lift millions out of poverty and reduce child mortality rates."

His call for action was welcomed by many attendees at the conference, who expressed their support for initiatives aimed at helping improve living conditions for people around the world. It remains to be seen whether governments and other stakeholders will respond to Mr Brown's challenge and commit themselves to taking concrete steps towards achieving the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals.
