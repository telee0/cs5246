Summary: The 15 year embargo that has been imposed by the United States against Chinese imports due to human rights abuses was eased this week. This move came a day after China announced its plans for democratic reforms and increased transparency. According to sources, the US government is considering lifting all remaining economic sanctions on China, including restrictions on exports to the country and investments here. Meanwhile, European Union leaders have also agreed to lift their economic sanctions on China, citing progress towards democracy and better human rights. However, there are still concerns among critics that China's actions do not go far enough.

Summary: UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who held talks with Chinese officials in Beijing yesterday, stated that the EU arms code is more effective than the current ban on weapons export to China. According to him, the EU code provides a framework for dialogue between Europe and China on the issue of arms control, while the US ban does nothing but harm the relationship. Straw also expressed his hope that China would take part in international efforts to curb illegal weapons trafficking, which he said is one of the major threats facing the world today. Despite these positive developments, there remain tensions between China and the West over issues such as human rights abuses and territorial disputes.

Summary: In the face of growing criticism from Western powers, China has made limited concessions towards democratic reforms. These include allowing local elections and giving greater autonomy to provinces, but many experts believe that they fall short of what is required for true democracy. The US, in particular, has criticized China for its lack of political freedoms and human rights violations, including the use of torture against dissidents. Meanwhile, the European Union has lifted most of its economic sanctions on China, citing improvements in governance and transparency. Despite these moves, however, tensions continue to simmer between the West and Asia's rising power.

Summary: As China continues to grow at breakneck speed, it is becoming increasingly clear that it will soon surpass the US as the world's biggest economy. According to recent estimates, China is currently on track to grow at an annual rate of 10% or more in the coming years, compared to just 3% for the US. This growth is driven by massive investment in infrastructure projects, such as highways, airports and energy plants, as well as booming manufacturing industries. While this rapid expansion has brought immense benefits to China, including improved living standards and reduced poverty, there are also concerns about sustainability and the impact on other countries in the region.
