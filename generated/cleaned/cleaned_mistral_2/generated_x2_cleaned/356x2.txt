Prime Minister Boris Johnson has welcomed a new report on Scotland’s economy and highlighted its potential role in shaping his party’s election manifesto.

In a speech in Edinburgh, Mr Johnson said he saw “huge opportunities” ahead of him following publication of the Scottish Fiscal Commission’s latest economic outlook. The commission predicted that while Scotland’s growth is expected to fall slightly over the coming years, it will remain stronger than the UK average.

Mr Johnson added: “This report confirms what we know – Scotland’s economy remains strong and stable under Conservative leadership.” He also emphasised that this stability would form the backbone of his party’s next general election campaign.

Labour leader Ed Miliband had earlier attacked the government for failing to tackle inequality and unemployment in Scotland during their time in power. But Mr Johnson hit back at these claims, arguing that his party had created thousands of jobs and invested heavily in infrastructure across the country.

He went on to criticise the SNP-led devolved government for poor performance, accusing them of squandering resources on vanity projects such as an independence referendum rather than addressing pressing issues like education and healthcare.

The prime minister concluded by pledging his commitment to ensuring Scotland remained part of a thriving United Kingdom. He stressed that despite differences between England and Scotland, there were many shared interests and values which should not be put at risk.

Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael praised the report’s findings, saying they demonstrated the importance of maintaining close links with the rest of the UK. He urged caution against those who sought to create divisions within the Union, adding: “We must work together to build a prosperous future for ourselves and our children.”

Meanwhile, opposition parties have been quick to seize on any signs of instability or weakness in the economy. Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Jeremy Corbin described the SFC’s predictions as “alarming”, warning that slow growth could lead to job losses and higher debt levels.

Ukip MEP David Coburn claimed the report proved that Scottish voters were better off sticking with Westminster rulemakers, arguing that devolution had led to chaos and uncertainty. He called for more powers to be handed back from Holyrood to London, insisting this would help restore stability to the region.

However, even critics acknowledged that Scotland’s relatively robust economy compared favourably with others across Europe, particularly Greece and Spain. This strength was attributed in part to the ongoing presence of British firms and investors based north of the border, providing a cushion against global market volatility.

As political parties continue to debate the best approach to governing Scotland, one thing is clear – the country’s economic performance will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of May’s general election. With just months left until polling day, both sides are keen to highlight their achievements and make promises for the future.
