The British government is facing fierce criticism from politicians and human rights groups for its treatment of terror suspects following a ruling by the House of Lords. The decision came after the law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terrorist suspects without trial was a violation of their human rights. This has led to calls for an end to controversial measures such as control orders, which allow individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism to be subjected to house arrest, curfews or tagging.

Charles Clarke, who served as Home Secretary under Tony Blair's administration, introduced the control orders as part of his plan to counter terrorism. However, the policy has been widely criticized for infringing on civil liberties and due process. In recent years, there have been numerous cases where people were detained under control orders but never charged with any crime.

As a result of this legal victory against the government's policies, activists are calling for a complete repeal of the control order system and a more transparent approach to dealing with terrorism threats. They argue that while it is important to protect national security, this should not come at the expense of individual freedoms and rights.

Meanwhile, the opposition parties have used the issue to launch attacks on the current administration. Labour MPs accused the government of failing to provide adequate protection for citizens and undermining civil liberties. The Conservative Party also weighed in, saying they would scrap the control orders if they ever returned to power.

In light of the ruling and growing public pressure, it seems likely that the government will reconsider its stance on terrorism suspects. It may also lead to further changes in anti-terror legislation, including increased oversight of intelligence agencies and greater transparency in the justice system.

This ruling marks another blow for the UK government's attempts to balance national security with individual freedoms. With ongoing tensions between the two, it remains to be seen how long the government can maintain its hardline stance on terrorism without causing widespread outrage among citizens.
