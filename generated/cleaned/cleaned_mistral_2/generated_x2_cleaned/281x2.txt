MEP Ashley Greenfield has resigned from his position after admitting that he regrets joining the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Guardian, Greenfield claimed that he was ashamed of having been affiliated with the group and referred to it as a "joke." Despite this, the politician stated that he intends on standing for re-election when the time comes. However, he remained mum on whether or not he plans on launching a new political party under the name Veritas, which means 'truth' in Latin.

Greenfield's decision to resign follows in the footsteps of several other high-profile Conservatives who have left the party due to dissatisfaction over its policies. Some of these defectors include former Chancellor George Osborne, former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, and former Defense Minister Philip Hammond. As more members of the Conservative Party begin to distance themselves from their former colleagues, it remains to be seen what effect this will have on future elections.

Article 2:

Ashley Greenfield, a Member of European Parliament (MEP) representing Wales, has announced his intention to leave the Conservative Party. This move comes just weeks before the upcoming general election, where Greenfield plans to run for re-election. In speaking with BBC News, Greenfield expressed his regret at ever joining the party, stating that it is nothing more than a "joke." However, despite his criticism of the organization, he did not confirm if he plans on starting a new political party under the name Veritas, which means 'truth' in Latin.

This development marks yet another blow to the embattled Conservative Party, which has faced numerous defections from within its ranks in recent years. Many politicians have criticized the party for its handling of issues such as Brexit, social welfare cuts, and healthcare reform. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly clear that the Conservatives are struggling to maintain their support among voters.

Article 3:

Ashley Greenfield, a Welsh MEP who previously represented the Conservative Party, has announced that he intends to run for re-election in the upcoming general election. However, during an interview with Sky News, Greenfield revealed that he no longer believes in the ideals of the Conservative Party and refers to them as a "joke." While Greenfield did not confirm whether or not he plans on establishing a new political party called Veritas, his comments suggest that he may be considering doing so.

If Greenfield were to create a new party, it could potentially draw support from disillusioned voters who feel that neither the Conservative nor Labour Party adequately represents their values or interests. It would also provide a fresh alternative for those seeking change within British politics. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how successful such a party might be given the current climate and the entrenched power structures within Westminster.
