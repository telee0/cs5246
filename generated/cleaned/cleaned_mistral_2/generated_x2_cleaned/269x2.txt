Only a quarter of 14-16 year olds know the basics of British politics, including which parties are in power. This contrasts starkly with older generations, where knowledge of politics has been found to be much higher among young adults aged 18-29. Despite this lack of understanding, however, it seems that young people do still have an interest in politics - almost three quarters said they had followed recent events closely. However, when asked to name specific politicians, many struggled. Just one in six could identify Michael Howard, leader of the Conservative Party during the 2005 election campaign. Meanwhile, only one in ten could recall Charles Kennedy's leadership as Liberal Democrat leader between 1997 and 2006. The study also found that most young people did not feel politically engaged or represented by any particular party, suggesting that there may be significant challenges ahead for political engagement among future generations.
