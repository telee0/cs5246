As they enter into the event, the party is determined to stress the importance of their policies and how they differ from those of Labour. The Conservatives believe that they offer voters a clear alternative to Tony Blair's Labour Party, with an emphasis on reducing taxes and increasing spending for schools and hospitals.

During the opening speech at the forum, Tory Co-Chairman Liam Fox took aim at Tony Blair's legacy. He accused the former Prime Minister of failing to address key issues such as immigration and crime, while also attacking his handling of the Iraq War. Fox argued that the current economic situation was due to years of mismanagement by Labour, and urged voters to reject them in favour of the Conservatives.

While the Conservative Party remains confident in its ability to win the upcoming election, there have been concerns raised over recent polling data. Some experts predict that Labour will retain power with a slim majority, despite the party's poor performance in the last few years. This has led to calls within the Conservative Party to refine its messaging and strategy in order to appeal more widely to voters.

Despite these challenges, many members of the Conservative Party are optimistic heading into the spring forum. They believe that the party's strong record of economic growth and job creation, combined with a clear message of change, will be enough to secure victory at the ballot box. With only months left before the general election, it remains to be seen whether the party can successfully navigate the complex political landscape and emerge victorious in May.
