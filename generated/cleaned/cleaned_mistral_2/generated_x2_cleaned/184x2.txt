In a surprising turn of events, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding Lord Goldsmith's statement to Parliament during his monthly press conference yesterday. The statement has faced criticism from various quarters after it emerged that there were inconsistencies between what was said and the evidence presented in court.

Johnson acknowledged the concerns raised by several members of parliament regarding the matter. He stated that he understood their frustrations and assured them that the government is taking the issue seriously. According to him, the Attorney-General had already initiated an investigation into the matter, and they would be reporting back to the public soon.

Earlier in the day, Conservative MP Michael Mates added fuel to the fire when he called for an independent probe into the matter. Mates argued that the attorney general’s statement should have been based solely on the facts rather than political considerations. His comments came as a result of the growing dissatisfaction among many Tory MPs who are concerned about the integrity of the justice system.

Despite this development, the PM reiterated his confidence in the Attorney General and emphasized that he will not tolerate any interference or manipulation in legal matters. “We take our responsibilities very seriously,” he stressed. “And we will ensure that our justice systems remain fair and impartial.”

Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer also expressed his views on the matter. In a statement, he demanded transparency from the government regarding the circumstances surrounding Lord Goldsmith’s statement. “It is essential that the public trusts our judiciary and our politicians," he insisted. “If the government cannot provide clear answers and accountability, then it risks undermining both institutions.”

The controversy over Lord Goldsmith’s statement began last week when a judge ruled that his decision to withdraw from the prosecution of two Saudi princes in relation to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi had been unlawful. The ruling prompted a wave of outrage among human rights groups and opposition parties, who accused the government of trying to protect the Saudi royal family from accountability.

As a result of the backlash, the government has been under immense pressure to clarify its position on the matter. Several MPs, including Mates, have called for an investigation into whether Lord Goldsmith’s decision was influenced by political considerations rather than the rule of law. Some have even suggested that the attorney-general may face disciplinary action if found guilty of impropriety.

However, the government has remained steadfast in its support for Lord Goldsmith. They insist that he made a difficult decision in the best interests of justice, given the complex diplomatic relations involved. However, these explanations have done little to appease critics who argue that the attorney general must act independently of political considerations.

The debate over Lord Goldsmith’s decision continues to rage, and it seems unlikely to subside anytime soon. With the upcoming election looming, the government faces increasing scrutiny on all fronts, and this scandal could well prove costly in terms of voter loyalty. It remains to be seen how long the PM can hold onto his confidence in Lord Goldsmith and maintain the support of key stakeholders within his party.
