The current voter registration process has been called into question by election officials due to several mistakes that have occurred in recent elections. According to the Electoral Commission, these mistakes are largely caused by a system where only one person in each household applies for voting forms on behalf of all occupants.

This practice is known as proxy voting, and it has been used in many countries for decades. However, it can be problematic when it comes to ensuring accurate voter rolls and preventing fraudulent activity. For example, if someone living in the same household as an eligible voter fails to apply for a form or submits incorrect information, it could result in that individual being unable to vote in upcoming elections.

To address this issue, election officials are proposing changes to the voter registration system. Instead of having just one person in each household apply for voting forms, they suggest allowing individuals to register themselves. This would require every eligible citizen to provide their own personal details and ensure that their names are correctly entered onto the voter roll.

Supporters of this proposal argue that enabling people to register individually will help reduce errors and prevent fraud. By requiring voters to submit their own information, there will be less room for misunderstandings or mistakes to occur. Additionally, it would make it more difficult for anyone to intentionally falsify voter records or manipulate the results of an election.

Critics of the proposed change argue that it would create additional administrative burden for both election officials and voters. They worry that individuals who may not have access to technology or transportation might struggle to register themselves online. Additionally, there is concern that the new system could disproportionately affect certain groups, such as those living in rural areas or those with mobility issues.

Despite these concerns, the Electoral Commission remains committed to implementing the proposed changes to the voter registration system. They believe that the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks and that enabling citizens to register individually will help strengthen democracy and ensure fairness in future elections.
