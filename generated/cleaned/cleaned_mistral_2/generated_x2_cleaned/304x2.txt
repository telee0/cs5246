Despite facing criticism and skepticism from political pundits, UKIP was able to secure an impressive number of seats and finished in third place with an additional ten Members of European Parliament (MEPs). Their success can be attributed to their strong messaging, effective use of social media, and ability to tap into growing anti-establishment sentiment among voters. While UKIP has yet to reveal its long-term goals, its success suggests that there is still significant support for policies outside of the mainstream.
