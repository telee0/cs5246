The Environment Select Committee has raised concerns over the sloppy wording of a proposed draft animal welfare bill that could put anglers at risk of legal action despite not being the intended target. The committee believes that there needs to be more clarity and precision when it comes to language used in bills, particularly when it involves sensitive issues like animal welfare.

According to committee chairperson Dr Mike Joyce, “It’s important that we get the language right so that everyone understands what’s being proposed.” He added that the current draft of the bill could potentially have unintended consequences for anglers who might end up violating laws without realizing it.

“Anglers are passionate people about their sport, but if they don't understand the rules, then they can face penalties,” Dr Joyce explained. “That's why it's crucial to make sure that any changes made to existing regulations or legislation take into account all relevant stakeholders.”

In response to these concerns, the Government has assured the committee that they will work to clarify the draft bill before submitting it for debate in Parliament. They also acknowledged that there may be unintended consequences associated with certain clauses of the bill, which is why they intend to engage with experts from various sectors such as fishing groups, conservationists, and scientists to ensure that the final version of the bill accurately reflects the intentions of lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the National Fish & Game Council (NFGC) expressed its disappointment over the potential impact that the draft bill could have on recreational fishers. According to NFGC Chief Executive Martin Taylor-Smith, the bill could result in additional restrictions on where and how anglers can fish, making it harder for them to participate in their hobby.

“We understand the need for better animal welfare standards, but this should not come at the expense of our most popular recreational activity,” Mr Taylor-Smith stated. “We urge the Government to consider alternative measures that would achieve their goals while minimizing negative impacts on the community and the economy.”

However, not everyone shares the same viewpoint. Some animal rights activists argue that the current state of animal welfare in New Zealand is far from adequate and that stronger measures must be taken to protect animals from harm. In fact, one group known as Animals Today has already launched a petition calling for an end to recreational hunting altogether.

While the debate continues, it’s clear that politicians need to pay close attention to the language used in bills and seek input from multiple perspectives before passing new legislation. As Dr Joyce puts it, “We want to see a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of both animal welfare advocates and those who enjoy outdoor activities like fishing.”

In conclusion, the proposed draft animal welfare bill raises significant concerns for angler communities across New Zealand. With careful consideration given to language use and stakeholder engagement, however, the government can ensure that the bill achieves its objectives while minimizing negative impacts on recreational fishermen and wildlife alike.
