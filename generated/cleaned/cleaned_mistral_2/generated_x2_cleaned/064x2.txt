Despite widespread opposition to the move, he stood firm and pushed for Turkey's admission into the EU. In an interview after leaving a Brussels summit on Tuesday, Blair reiterated his support for Turkish membership, saying that it did not matter if Turkey was a Muslim country. He argued that Turkey met all the necessary criteria for EU membership, including having a functioning democracy and adopting Western values and standards.

Blair faced criticism from many quarters for his stance on Turkish membership. Some politicians questioned whether Turkey was truly ready for EU membership, while others worried that allowing a predominantly Muslim country into the bloc could undermine its core principles of freedom and equality. However, Blair remained steadfast and maintained that Turkey had made significant progress in recent years and deserved a place in the EU. He also pointed out that Turkey would bring significant economic benefits to the EU and strengthen ties between Europe and Asia.

In conclusion, Tony Blair's stance on Turkish membership remains controversial even today. While there are valid concerns about Turkey's readiness for EU membership, Blair's argument that it is unfair to discriminate against a Muslim country based solely on their religion is worth considering. As Europe faces increasing pressure from other countries seeking to join the union, Blair's message may become increasingly relevant in shaping how we approach future EU expansion decisions.
