A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to comment on the rumors, saying only that the government was focused on ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East region. However, sources close to the government have confirmed that there has been ongoing discussions between officials regarding the possibility of military action against Iran. This comes after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the historic nuclear deal signed by his predecessor Barack Obama, leaving many countries concerned about Tehran's nuclear capabilities. Some experts predict that without the constraints imposed by the deal, Iran could develop a weapons program within months, posing a serious threat to global security. As tensions rise, both Britain and its allies are closely monitoring the situation to assess their next course of action.
