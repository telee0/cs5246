During a recent interview with former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, host David Frost pressed him on an old comment he had made about British politicians being corrupt. According to Frost, Kinnock had called members of Parliament "brigands, muggers, bribers and gangsters" in the past. However, Kinnock argued that his remarks were taken out of context and should not be used against him today. He explained that at the time, he was criticizing the way in which some politicians were behaving and how they were treating the public. Despite this, Kinnock acknowledged that his choice of words may have been too strong and that he regretted making them. The debate over whether or not Kinnock's comment was fair continued throughout the show, with many viewers taking sides based on their political beliefs. Ultimately, however, it seemed that the main takeaway from the interview was that even after so many years, Kinnock was still willing to admit when he had done wrong and apologize for it. This could serve as an example to other politicians who may face similar scrutiny in the future.
