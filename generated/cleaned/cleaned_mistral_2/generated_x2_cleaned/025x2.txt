Former Home Secretary Barbara Roche has called for the establishment of a monitoring group that can independently track and report on immigration statistics and counter the propaganda of anti-immigrant organizations such as Migration Watch. In her speech at a migration conference yesterday, Roche highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in the way immigration data is collected and presented to the public.

Roche criticized Migration Watch and other similar groups for their lack of independence and bias towards reducing immigration. She urged them to disclose their funding sources and methodologies to ensure their credibility and accuracy. Roche also pointed out the importance of separating fact from fiction when it comes to immigration issues, particularly in light of recent controversies over the Windrush scandal and Brexit's impact on migrants.

The proposed monitoring group would aim to provide accurate and unbiased information on immigration trends and patterns, while also promoting diversity and inclusion in society. It would work closely with governments, civil society organizations, and academics to gather data and develop policy recommendations based on empirical evidence. By doing so, the group could help combat the negative stereotypes and misinformation that have been perpetuated by certain media outlets and political parties.

Roche acknowledged that establishing such a group would require significant resources and expertise but insisted that it was essential for maintaining a fair and just approach to immigration policies. She argued that only through independent monitoring and analysis could we hope to build a more inclusive and equitable future for all members of our society.
