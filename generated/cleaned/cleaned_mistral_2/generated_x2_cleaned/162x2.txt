It was revealed that 1,500 "safety whistleblower" have lost their jobs between 1999 and now. This comes as a concern for trade unions and labor rights activists who are calling on the government to take action.

Some firms were accused of being more interested in profitability than the welfare of their employees. In many cases, these companies found it cheaper to fire a worker than to make changes to the building or adjust working conditions. The report also highlighted the lack of support provided by the government for those who lose their jobs as a result of blowing the whistle.

Labor leaders called on the government to introduce new laws to protect workers' rights to speak out about safety concerns. They also urged employers to take responsibility for creating safe environments for their workers. Many people are concerned about the potential health risks posed by unsafe working conditions, especially given recent incidents such as the Grenfell tower fire and the ongoing construction industry scandals.

There is currently no official response from the government on this issue, but there are calls for a review of current legislation regarding workplace safety and whistleblowing. Some experts argue that the law needs to be updated to reflect modern-day working practices and provide greater protection for workers. Others suggest that more resources need to be allocated towards enforcing existing regulations.

Despite these challenges, labor leaders remain committed to fighting for better workers' rights and ensuring a safer workplace for everyone. They believe that every employee should feel free to speak up about safety issues without fear of retaliation. Only through collective action can real progress be made in improving workplace safety and protecting the rights of workers.
