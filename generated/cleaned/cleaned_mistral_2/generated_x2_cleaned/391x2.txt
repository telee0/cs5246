In a written parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie stated that the poll was likely to come at a similar expense as a full-blown electoral contest. However, Mr. Leslie emphasized that the cost of the referendum should not be compared with the only previous British referendum, which took place over three decades ago. Despite this warning, it is clear that the Brexit vote will have significant financial implications for taxpayers, and critics have accused the government of trying to downplay these costs in order to sway public opinion in favor of leaving the European Union. As the debate rages on, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability when it comes to spending on political campaigns and referendums.
