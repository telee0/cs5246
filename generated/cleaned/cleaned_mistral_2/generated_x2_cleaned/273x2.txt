This move has been met with mixed reactions from legal professionals who are concerned about the impact on judicial independence.

One key change under these reforms will see the removal of the Lord Chancellor's judicial functions. Under new laws, the position will no longer require the holder to be a qualified barrister or solicitor. Instead, they will simply need to have experience working within the legal sector, such as serving as a judge or magistrate.

"We believe that this change is necessary to ensure greater efficiency and transparency within our justice system," said Courts Minister Christopher Leslie. "It also sends a clear signal that we are committed to ensuring the independence of the judiciary."

However, many legal experts have expressed their concern over the loss of judicial power held by the Lord Chancellor. They argue that without this authority, the position may lose credibility and influence within the legal community. Additionally, there are concerns that the appointment process for the Lord Chancellor could become politically-driven rather than based solely on merit.

"This decision undermines the principle of judicial independence which has been at the heart of our constitution since its creation," said Bar Council Chair John Smith QC. "If the Lord Chancellor loses his or her ability to provide independent oversight of the administration of justice, then it threatens the very integrity of our legal system."

Despite these criticisms, however, the government remains steadfast in its commitment to reforming the justice system. It believes that these changes will help to reduce delays and improve outcomes for all parties involved, including victims, witnesses, and defendants.

In addition to the loss of judicial powers, the Lord Chancellor's salary and allowances will also be subject to review under these reforms. The government hopes to make savings in order to fund other areas of public policy, such as healthcare and education.

Overall, the changes to the role of the Lord Chancellor represent a major shift within the British justice system. While some may view them as an attack on judicial independence, others see them as a necessary step towards improving access to justice and reducing costs. Only time will tell how successful these reforms prove to be, but one thing is certain: they mark a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to modernize our legal system.
