One of the few Blair-era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997. However, it wasn't long before he became Tony Blair's "cabinet enforcer," tasked with delivering tough decisions and keeping the party on track.

Over his career, Mandelson has been at the center of several high-profile scandals. In 2005, he was accused of offering bribes to journalists in exchange for favorable coverage. He denied any wrongdoing, but eventually stepped down as secretary of state for business after an investigation into his behavior. Despite this setback, Mandelson continued to be a key figure in Blair's government until the prime minister resigned in 2007.

In recent years, Mandelson has kept a low profile while focusing on his work with venture capital firm Lazard and writing a memoir detailing his time in Blair's cabinet. While many may view him as controversial, there's no denying that Mandelson played a critical role in shaping British politics during his time in office.
