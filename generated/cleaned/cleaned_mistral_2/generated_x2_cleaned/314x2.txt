The former prime minister made the comments during an interview with Sky News, adding that UBI was not necessarily the solution to the problem. Meanwhile, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has called on Theresa May's Government to scrap its Universal Credit benefit system and replace it with UBI instead. This move is seen as a way to provide more support to low-income families who may be struggling financially due to cuts in benefits under the current welfare reforms.
