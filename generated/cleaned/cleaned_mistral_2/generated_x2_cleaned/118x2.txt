The proposed measures, which are aimed at reducing the risk of witness tampering, include the installation of state-of-the-art technology in courtrooms to ensure that witnesses can give evidence without fear of retaliation.

Under the new plan, Lord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates’ courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. This includes soundproofed rooms where witnesses can give their testimony via live link or pre-recorded video. Additionally, more video links will be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms, further reducing the risk of encountering defendants who may pose a threat.

The move is seen as a major step forward in efforts to safeguard the rights of victims and witnesses in the UK criminal justice system. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases in which witnesses have been threatened or intimidated by defendants, leading to concerns over the safety of those giving evidence.

“We must take every possible measure to ensure that witnesses feel safe and confident when giving evidence,” said Lord Falconer. “These proposals represent a significant investment in our criminal justice system and will go a long way towards protecting vulnerable individuals from abuse and intimidation.”

In addition to improving witness protection, the new measures are also expected to increase efficiency within the criminal justice system. By providing more opportunities for witnesses to give evidence remotely, courts will be able to hear cases faster and more efficiently, ultimately saving time and resources for both witnesses and the legal community.

However, some critics have raised concerns about the cost of implementing these changes. While Lord Falconer insists that the measures will ultimately save money in the long run by reducing the need for repeat court appearances, opponents argue that the initial outlay could be prohibitively expensive.

Despite these concerns, Lord Falconer remains committed to seeing the changes through. He believes that the benefits of improved witness protection far outweigh any potential costs, and he is determined to make sure that the UK criminal justice system remains fair and just for everyone involved.

Overall, the proposed changes to the UK criminal justice system represent a positive step towards greater transparency and accountability in the judicial process. By ensuring that witnesses feel safe and protected, Lord Falconer hopes to create a more effective and efficient criminal justice system that serves the needs of everyone involved – including victims, witnesses, and defendants alike.
