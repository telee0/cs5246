The results of a recent poll have shown that only 13% of respondents believe that politicians delivered on their promises, while 87% said otherwise. This is concerning, as it suggests that the public is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the political establishment ahead of upcoming elections. And just this week, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has predicted that "trust will be the key choice" at the next election, further highlighting the need for politicians to regain the confidence of voters.

This latest survey was conducted by ICM for BBC News 24 and asked 1,000 adults across the UK about their views on the government's performance. While some may argue that these figures are simply an indication of people's cynicism towards politicians, others suggest that there may be more substance to them than meets the eye.

It is certainly true that over recent years, we have seen many examples of failed promises made by those in power. From the Iraq War to the financial crisis to Brexit - all of these issues have left many people feeling like politicians have let them down. But it could also be argued that this is due to factors beyond politicians' control. For instance, no one could have anticipated the full extent of the financial crash or the ongoing difficulties faced by our economy.

However, regardless of whether the reasons behind broken promises lie within or outside of politicians' hands, there can be little doubt that trust is becoming harder to come by in today's political climate. And this is particularly problematic given the fact that trust is essential if governments hope to implement effective policies and achieve their desired outcomes. After all, without the support of the public, even the most well-intentioned initiatives are likely to fail.

So what does all of this mean for the future of British politics? It seems clear that politicians will need to do everything in their power to rebuild trust among the electorate if they want to stand any chance of success at the ballot box. Whether this means taking a more conciliatory approach to controversial issues like immigration or offering concrete solutions to economic challenges remains to be seen.

What is certain, however, is that the days when politicians could simply take voter support for granted are long gone. With so much uncertainty surrounding the world we live in, the electorate is now looking for leaders who can inspire confidence and provide real answers to their problems. Failure to do so could lead to significant consequences for both the ruling party and the broader political landscape in Britain.
