The proposal was first recommended by the Electoral Commission last year as part of their review into electoral law. In response, Constitutional Affairs Minister Christopher Leslie has now stated that his department will implement this measure. He explained that young people deserve to have a voice at the table and should not be excluded based on their age.

Supporters of the move argue that it is essential to ensure that political decisions are made by those who will be most affected by them. They also believe that reducing the voting age will encourage more young people to engage in politics and become active members of society. Critics, however, warn that such a significant change could lead to unintended consequences and may result in less experienced MPs being elected.

The proposed reduction in the minimum age for MPs is just one of several measures aimed at increasing youth engagement in politics. Other initiatives include providing more education and resources to help young people understand how to get involved in local democracy, as well as creating more opportunities for young people to participate in policy discussions and debates.

While the announcement of the plan has received mixed reactions, many politicians are eager to see the change come into effect. They believe that it is crucial to listen to young voices and give them a seat at the table, where they can shape the future of our country. With the upcoming general election set to take place within the next few months, we can expect to hear more about these changes and what impact they might have on our political landscape.
