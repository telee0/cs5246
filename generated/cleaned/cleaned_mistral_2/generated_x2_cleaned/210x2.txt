The move came after months of failed negotiations between trade unions and the government over pay and working conditions.

The strike, organized by the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), saw thousands of employees taking to picket lines outside key government buildings across Wales. Many also marched through central London in protest against what they claim are years of underfunding and neglect of the civil service.

As a result of the walkout, several Welsh government departments experienced significant delays and cancellations of appointments and meetings. Some local authorities and health boards also reported disruptions to their services, including difficulties processing applications for benefits and passports.

"We regret that the PCS has chosen to take this course of action," said a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office in Wales. "Our priority is always to ensure that our staff can deliver high-quality services to the public, but we cannot ignore the concerns of those who work hard every day to support our communities and families across Wales."

In response to the strike, the union's leader claimed that the civil service had been undervalued and overlooked for far too long. "For decades now, civil service workers have faced real terms pay cuts and an erosion of their rights and protections," he said. "This strikes show just how fed up and angry people are at being ignored."

The impact of the strike was felt not only in Wales but also in other parts of the United Kingdom. In England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, many civil service offices closed or reduced their opening hours in solidarity with their counterparts in Wales.

Despite calls from opposition politicians for the strike to be suspended, it appears that the dispute will continue well into the new year. The PCSU has already announced plans for further industrial action in January, which could see even more disruptions to essential services in Wales.
