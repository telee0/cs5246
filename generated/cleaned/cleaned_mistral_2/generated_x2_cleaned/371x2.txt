During his speech at the Conservative Party Conference, Johnson emphasized the need for greater unity and inclusivity within the party. He said: "We must embrace our diversity and celebrate the fact that we are all part of one British family. We must reject division and hate-filled rhetoric and instead work together to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come."

Johnson also highlighted the importance of empowering individuals from underrepresented communities to achieve their full potential. He said: "I am determined to give every young person, regardless of their background, the chance to succeed. I want to see more people from diverse backgrounds taking up leadership positions in business, politics, and society as a whole."

The Prime Minister also spoke out against racism and discrimination, saying: "There is no place for hatred or prejudice in our great nation. It is time to put aside our differences and focus on what unites us – our shared love for this country and its people."

His comments were met with applause and support from many attendees of the conference. However, some critics have questioned whether Johnson's words ring true given the history of conservative policies that disproportionately harm minority groups.

Despite these criticisms, however, Johnson remains committed to creating a more inclusive and equal society. He has already taken several steps to address issues such as immigration policy, mental health funding, and social mobility initiatives.

As the election approaches, Johnson knows that winning over voters will be crucial if he hopes to maintain his grip on power. His message of unity and inclusivity may well resonate with those who feel left behind by previous administrations and provide him with the necessary momentum to secure another victory for the Tories.
