In an upbeat pre-Budget report, the chancellor has indicated that he will allow borrowing to rise slightly from £45.2 billion ($61 billion) this year to £49 billion ($73 billion) next year. However, Mr. Hammond insists that economic targets will still be met and emphasized the importance of maintaining stability for businesses and households.

Despite concerns over Brexit and uncertainty about the future of the global economy, the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK industrial history, which began in 2013. While denying any gloating or complacency, Mr. Hammond said that he believed Britain's strong economy was due to his policies and that it was essential to continue investing in infrastructure, research and development, and education in order to secure long-term prosperity.

However, critics have warned that the government should not become too reliant on borrowing to fund public services and that there are risks associated with increasing debt levels. They also point out that many people are struggling to make ends meet, particularly in light of rising living costs and stagnant wages. As such, the opposition parties may call for more action on these issues during the upcoming Budget debate.

Meanwhile, political tensions remain high in Europe following last week's European Union summit, where leaders agreed to give Britain another extension to its Brexit deadline. This decision came after Theresa May, who resigned as prime minister earlier this month, failed to convince MPs to support her withdrawal agreement. With just weeks left until the original October deadline, the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson must now find a way to break the deadlock and deliver a deal that satisfies both Britain and the EU.

In the United States, President Donald Trump's impeachment trial continues in the Senate. Following the conclusion of hearings by two committees in the House of Representatives, the full House voted along party lines to send charges against Trump to the Senate. While Democrats argue that the president abused power and obstructed justice, Republicans insist that they do not have enough evidence to remove him from office. Despite calls from opponents to hold off on impeachment proceedings until after the 2020 election, the Republican leadership has shown no signs of changing course.

Closer to home, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for another independence referendum in response to what she sees as Westminster's failure to listen to Scottish voters. In a speech at Edinburgh University, Ms. Sturgeon said that the recent general election result showed that Scotland remains deeply divided and frustrated with the current political setup. She added that a second independence vote could help to resolve these issues once and for all, and that she believes that the majority of Scots would vote to leave the UK if given the chance.

While the prospect of another independence vote may seem daunting to those outside Scotland, it is important to note that such a move would require significant legal and logistical challenges. Moreover, polling suggests that support for independence remains relatively low among Scottish voters, although there is certainly a sizeable minority who favor greater autonomy or even separation from the rest of the UK. Nevertheless, the threat of another referendum is likely to put pressure on the British government to address Scottish concerns and ensure that devolved powers are properly protected.
