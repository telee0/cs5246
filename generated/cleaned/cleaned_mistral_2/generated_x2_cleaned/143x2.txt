The current situation is no different as only 20 out of the total 660 seats in the House of Commons are held by representatives from ethnic minorities. This low representation has led to calls for change and greater inclusivity in the political arena.

One such voice calling for greater representation was that of Shahid Malik, who sits on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC). In an interview with the media, Mr. Malik acknowledged the frustration felt by many when it comes to the low number of ethnic minorities in parliament. However, he emphasized the need for specific targets rather than just lists to increase minority representation.

Mr. Malik argued that simply creating a list of candidates from diverse backgrounds would not necessarily lead to their successful election. Instead, he believed that setting targets for the number of minority MPs needed in certain areas or regions could help ensure that more people from these communities were represented in parliament. He also pointed out that the focus should not solely be on increasing the number of MPs from ethnic minorities but also on ensuring that they had the resources and support necessary to effectively represent their constituents.

Despite his call for greater diversity in the UK government, Mr. Malik recognized that achieving this goal would require significant effort on behalf of all parties involved. He stressed the importance of working together to create a more inclusive political landscape where everyone had a voice and was able to contribute equally.

Many experts agree with Mr. Malik that targeted efforts are needed to increase minority representation in parliament. They point out that while affirmative action policies may have helped increase the number of women in parliament, similar initiatives have yet to have the same impact on minority groups. This suggests that a different approach may be needed if meaningful progress is to be made.

Some critics argue that the focus on diversity can sometimes come at the expense of other important issues, such as tackling poverty and inequality. They believe that politicians should first prioritize addressing these core concerns before turning their attention to diversity. While others acknowledge these challenges, they still maintain that greater diversity in politics is essential for building trust between elected officials and their constituents.

In conclusion, the issue of low minority representation in the UK government remains a pressing concern. It will take sustained efforts by politicians, policymakers, and citizens alike to bring about real change and build a more inclusive political landscape. As Mr. Malik rightly points out, targets rather than just lists may hold the key to unlocking the full potential of our democracy and giving everyone a voice.
