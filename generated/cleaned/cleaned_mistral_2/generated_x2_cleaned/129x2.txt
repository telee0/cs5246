The news came as it emerged that France had started evacuating its hostages following four days of intense anti-French protests in which at least six people have died. Meanwhile, tensions reached boiling point when nine French peacekeepers were killed in an ambush. This led to President Jacques Chirac ordering the devastation of the Ivory Coast’s airforce in a show of strength. It appears that the government is taking no prisoners in their bid to restore order to the troubled country. However, this move could escalate the conflict further and lead to more violence. Many fear that the situation will deteriorate rapidly unless both sides come to a negotiated settlement soon.
