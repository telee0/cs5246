The investigation was sparked after allegations that Mr Blunkett had given preferential treatment to his ex-lover’s nanny when she applied for British nationality. Sir Alan Budd’s inquiry found no evidence that Mr Blunkett had acted improperly or illegally in this matter. However, it did link him to the ex-home secretary’s involvement in speeding up other visa claims by people close to him.

Mr Blunkett has always maintained that he acted appropriately in all cases involving immigration matters. He said: “I have never been accused or charged with any wrongdoing related to my work as home secretary.” In response to the findings of Sir Alan Budd’s investigation, Mr Blunkett added: “It is clear from these reports that there were significant failures in the immigration system under both Labour and Conservative governments. I hope that we can now put these issues behind us and focus on building a better future for our country.”

The report also raised concerns about the way in which certain types of immigrants are treated differently based on their ethnicity or religion. Sir Alan Budd recommended that the government review its policies on immigration and ensure that everyone is treated fairly and equally.

Despite the controversy surrounding Mr Blunkett’s actions in relation to immigration matters, many politicians have praised Sir Alan Budd’s report for shedding light on the failings of the UK’s immigration system. They hope that it will pave the way for reforms aimed at improving fairness and efficiency in the process.
