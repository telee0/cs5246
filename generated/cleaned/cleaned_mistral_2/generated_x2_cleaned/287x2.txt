The former speaker, who was the first woman to hold the position, believes that Blair's decision to initiate certain reforms may not have had a clear outcome in mind. However, she acknowledges that these changes have brought about positive developments.

"It is difficult to say whether Tony Blair knew what he was getting himself into when he made decisions such as Iraq War," Baroness Boothroyd stated during an interview with the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. "But I think he did realize the need for change within our society and economy, which led to significant progress being made under his leadership."

The baroness further added that while she disagrees with some aspects of Blair's policies, she respects his efforts to improve Britain. She believes that it is now up to individuals and groups to build upon this foundation and continue to push forward.

"We cannot blame Blair entirely for everything that has happened since then," Baroness Boothroyd continued. "But it is now our responsibility to take care of things and ensure that the benefits of his initiatives are sustained. We must also learn from past mistakes and work together to create a better future for all."

Overall, Baroness Boothroyd's comments provide insight into the complexities of Tony Blair's legacy and how it will shape British political discourse in years to come. As she puts it, "It is important to remember both the good and bad points about any leader or policy, and use that knowledge to move forward."
