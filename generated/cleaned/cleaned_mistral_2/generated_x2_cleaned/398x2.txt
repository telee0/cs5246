During his speech at the launch event, he highlighted the party’s flagship promise to overhaul the current council tax system and introduce a new local income tax in its place. This change, according to Mr. Davey, would be more fair and equitable, allowing residents to contribute based on their earning capabilities rather than property value. He further stated that this move would also provide additional revenue for councils, enabling them to invest in essential services like education, health care, and social housing.
