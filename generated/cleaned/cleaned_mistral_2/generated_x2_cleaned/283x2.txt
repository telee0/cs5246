The three main political parties have all put forward their plans for how they would approach this contentious topic, with each party offering its own unique perspective.

Despite pressure from both the Conservatives and Labour to lower taxes for businesses and individuals respectively, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to back down from his commitment to increasing revenue through higher taxes. This move could be seen as an attempt to appeal to voters who are looking for a more progressive leader, or it may simply reflect a belief that the current state of government finances requires significant reform. Regardless, it is clear that Mr Johnson's decision to raise taxes has sparked a great deal of controversy and raised questions about what impact such changes might have on the economy.

As polls continue to fluctuate in the weeks leading up to the election, the Liberal Democrats have emerged as the only major party willing to take a stand against increased taxation. Leader Jo Swinson has made it clear that her party would not support any further increases in income tax rates, arguing that doing so would hurt low-income households and stifle economic growth. Instead, she has called for greater investment in public services, including healthcare and education, to address the root causes of inequality and improve the quality of life for people across the country.

While some critics argue that the Lib Dems' position on taxation is too conservative, others see it as a refreshing departure from the traditional left-right divide on this issue. With many voters dissatisfied with both the Conservatives and Labour, the Liberals may well find themselves in a strong position to make gains in key marginals and potentially even form a coalition government if no single party wins outright.

Of course, the debate over taxation is far from limited to just these three parties. Many smaller groups and organizations also have their own specific ideas about how best to fund public services and promote economic prosperity. Some advocates of higher taxes argue that the wealthiest members of society should pay more in order to fund programs like universal healthcare, while others believe that reducing bureaucratic waste and improving efficiency would lead to more efficient use of resources and better outcomes for everyone involved.

Ultimately, only time will tell whether Mr Johnson's decision to raise taxes will prove successful or if it leads to negative consequences for the UK economy. However, one thing seems certain: the issue of taxation will remain at the center of political discourse for years to come. Whether voters ultimately choose a more liberal, socialist, or capitalist approach remains to be seen, but it's clear that the battle lines have already been drawn.
