In recent years, many people have come forward claiming that they were betrayed by the British authorities. One such individual is Viktor Makarov, a former Soviet spy who was promised defector status and a decent pension by the government. However, despite being awarded a Â£65,000 settlement four years ago, Makarov still feels as though he has not received what he was owed.

"I came to this country hoping for a better life," said Makarov, now aged 50. "But I can't help feeling betrayed. Despite all my hard work and sacrifice, I am still living below the poverty line and struggling to make ends meet."

Makarov claims that he was recruited into KGB intelligence during the Cold War era and spent decades working undercover in the UK before defecting to Britain. He had hoped that his services would be recognized and rewarded with defector status, which would grant him access to financial support and other benefits.

However, after receiving the settlement money from the government, Makarov found himself no closer to achieving his goals than before. "The settlement money did help me get by, but it wasn't enough to give me the kind of life I had envisioned when I arrived here," he explained.

Despite his struggles, Makarov remains determined to fight for the recognition he deserves. "I know there are others out there who are going through similar experiences, and we need to stand together to demand justice," he said.

Article 2:

As the political landscape continues to shift in Britain, many individuals feel as though they have been left behind. For Viktor Makarov, this sentiment rings especially true. Despite having worked tirelessly for the British government as a spy, he still finds himself without the recognition and support that he needs to thrive.

According to Makarov, he was promised defender status and a decent pension by the British authorities when he first defected to Britain. However, despite receiving a substantial settlement four years ago, he still has not received either one. "It's frustrating to think that the government promised me these things, but then failed to deliver on their end of the bargain," he said.

Makarov also expressed frustration at the lack of transparency and communication from the government regarding his case. "For too long, I have felt like just another number in a file somewhere," he said. "I deserve answers and accountability, and I won't stop fighting until I get them."

With the future uncertain for both Makarov and other spies who have defected to Britain, many are calling on the government to take action. They want to see those who have put their lives on the line for our country given the support and recognition they so rightfully deserve.
