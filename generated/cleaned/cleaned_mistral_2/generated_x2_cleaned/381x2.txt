In contrast, almost two-thirds of people supported a ban in 1999, according to a survey by Mori. However, the percentage of people who are neither pro-ban nor anti-ban has increased by 11%. This raises questions about whether the government is taking public opinion into account when making decisions related to fox hunting. Some argue that the current laws governing fox hunting are not sufficient and need to be strengthened, while others feel that it is a tradition that should be preserved. As such, politicians must carefully consider how to balance these competing interests in order to maintain public support.
