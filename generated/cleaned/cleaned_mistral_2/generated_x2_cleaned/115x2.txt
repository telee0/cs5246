As the ongoing debate over road safety measures continues, new research from University College London (UCL) has shed light on the impact that reducing the legal limit for drunk driving could have on saving lives. According to the study, cutting the current limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would result in an estimated 65 fewer deaths each year in the UK. This finding is being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS), which provides advice and evidence to MPs on transport issues. As lawmakers prepare to vote on the government’s Road Safety Bill, this new research adds another layer of complexity to the already heated debate over how best to tackle the issue.

The UCL researchers analyzed data from more than 40 studies conducted across Europe, including the UK, and found that there was a significant correlation between lowering the legal limit for drinking and driving and reduced fatalities. Specifically, they found that every one percent reduction in the limit led to a corresponding decrease in road deaths of approximately 9%. Given that the current limit of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood equates to almost twice the legal limit for breathalysers, it appears that a reduction to 50mg would have a considerable impact on overall road safety.

However, the potential benefits of such a change have been met with resistance from various stakeholders, particularly those within the hospitality industry who fear that stricter regulations will harm their businesses. There are also concerns about the effectiveness of enforcing the new limits, given that breathalyser technology can be unreliable and that some drivers may continue to drink before getting behind the wheel even if they know they will fail a test. Nevertheless, supporters of the measure argue that it would send a clear message to drivers that drunk driving simply won’t be tolerated, while also providing a tangible way to reduce the number of accidents caused by intoxicated individuals.

As the Road Safety Bill progresses through parliament, it remains unclear whether or not the legal limit for drunk driving will be lowered to 50mg or kept at its current level of 80mg. However, regardless of the outcome, the debate over road safety measures is likely to continue well beyond the passage of the bill itself, with different groups advocating for various approaches to addressing the issue. Whether it’s stricter enforcement of existing laws, increased education and awareness campaigns, or changes to the very nature of our transportation systems, it seems that everyone has a role to play in creating safer roads for all.
