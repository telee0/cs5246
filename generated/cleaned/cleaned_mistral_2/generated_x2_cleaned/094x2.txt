Former First Minister Jack McConnell spoke out against alcohol promotion as he addressed more than 100 secondary school students from the Highlands about the problem of binge drinking. Mr McConnell, who is now a member of Parliament for Glasgow North East, highlighted how young people are often encouraged to get drunk through cheap deals and advertising. The former Scottish leader called for an end to such practices and urged students to think critically about their own choices when it comes to drinking.

"Binge drinking can have serious consequences on your health, education, relationships and even your future," said Mr McConnell. "It's not just something that happens at parties or pubs – it also affects you in other parts of your life, like in school, work or college. And it's time we put an end to this harmful behaviour once and for all."

The former First Minister's comments were met with applause from many of the students, but there were also murmurs of disbelief at his criticism of young people. Some students felt that they had already taken steps to reduce their drinking, while others questioned why they should be held responsible for the actions of others. Mr McConnell acknowledged these concerns, but emphasized the importance of taking responsibility for our own choices.

"You may not always agree with what I say or what anyone else says," he said. "But ultimately, it's up to us to make the decisions that affect our lives. We need to learn how to think critically, ask questions, and take action when necessary."

Mr McConnell's message was backed up by statistics showing that Scotland still has one of the highest rates of binge drinking in Europe. According to the World Health Organization, over two-thirds of Scots aged 20-34 regularly drank heavily, and almost half did so every week. These figures have led to numerous public health campaigns aimed at reducing the prevalence of binge drinking, including the introduction of minimum pricing laws and stricter regulations on alcohol marketing.

Despite these efforts, however, Mr McConnell believes that more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of binge drinking. This includes addressing mental health issues, improving access to support services, and challenging cultural norms that encourage excessive drinking. In particular, he called on schools to do their part in promoting responsible attitudes towards alcohol.

"Schools play a critical role in shaping young people's values and beliefs," said Mr McConnell. "We need them to teach children that getting drunk is not glamorous, nor is it a normal way to socialize. Instead, we need to promote healthy lifestyles, positive relationships, and respectful decision-making skills."

However, not everyone agrees with Mr McConnell's approach. The SNP, which currently holds power in Scotland, has accused him of being hypocritical in his attacks on young people. They argue that it is not fair to blame students for the failures of adults, particularly given the lack of government investment in mental health care and substance abuse treatment.

"Scotland's young people deserve better than to be scapegoated for the mistakes of those who came before them," said SNP MP Angus MacNeil. "Instead of blaming teenagers for the culture of drink that Mr McConnell helped create, we need to invest in real solutions that will help prevent addiction and improve overall wellbeing."

While the debate continues over the best ways to address the issue of binge drinking, one thing is clear: Mr McConnell's speech to the Highlands students has sparked important conversations around responsible drinking and the impact it can have on young people's lives. Whether or not we agree with his views, it is crucial that we continue to engage with these issues and seek out practical solutions that will help
