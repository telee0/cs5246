Former United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who also served as Ireland’s first female president from 1990 to 2004, has condemned the UK government over its treatment of migrants under the Windrush scheme. During an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ms Robinson expressed her concern that the situation was “deeply troubling” and called upon the UK government to accept responsibility for their actions.

Ms Robinson highlighted the fact that many people had been wrongfully deported or detained under the Windrush scheme, which was introduced by Theresa May during her tenure as Home Secretary. She emphasized that the UK had a moral obligation to protect the rights of all individuals regardless of their background, and that this principle should extend to those seeking refugee status.

“It is deeply concerning to hear of the suffering and hardship faced by those affected by the Windrush policy,” Ms Robinson said. “As someone who has worked tirelessly to promote human rights and dignity across the world, I believe that it is our collective responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to the support and protection they need.”

During her time at the United Nations, Ms Robinson played a critical role in advocating for the rights of refugees and displaced persons. Her efforts helped establish the International Criminal Court, which has since prosecuted war crimes perpetrated in countries such as Sudan and Rwanda.

In recent years, Ms Robinson has continued to champion the cause for human rights, working closely with organizations such as Amnesty International and Oxfam. She has spoken out against the Trump administration’s travel ban and other policies that have targeted immigrants and refugees, highlighting the importance of upholding fundamental human rights principles.

Despite her criticisms, Ms Robinson remains hopeful that the UK government can turn things around and take meaningful action to address the issues raised by the Windrush scandal. “I do believe that there are still opportunities for change and improvement,” she said. “However, it will require political will and leadership to make these changes happen.”
