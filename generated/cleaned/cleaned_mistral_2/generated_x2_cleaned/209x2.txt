In response to these attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for increased military presence in the region. This move has been widely criticized by international leaders as escalating tensions further and potentially leading to another conflict.

Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has condemned the attacks and reiterated his commitment to peace negotiations with Israel. In an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, he said such attacks were against Palestinian interests. He emphasized that the Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting "a 100% effort" to end the violence, which has caused widespread suffering among civilians living near the border.

Despite these efforts, many experts believe that any progress made in negotiations will be short-lived until there is significant change in Israeli policies towards Palestinians. Specifically, they are calling for greater accountability for human rights abuses committed during Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a more inclusive approach to negotiating future borders and settlements.

Abbas himself acknowledged the challenges facing both sides in achieving lasting peace. He spoke out against the use of violence by extremists on all sides, including Hamas and other militant groups who oppose the two-state solution. However, he also noted the need for greater understanding and empathy from Israeli leaders and citizens towards Palestinians who have lived under occupation for decades.

As tensions rise and violence continues, it remains unclear whether this latest round of talks will lead to meaningful breakthroughs or simply push the parties further apart. Despite ongoing calls for diplomacy and dialogue, many remain skeptical about the prospects for peace and fear that any new developments could ultimately lead to war.
