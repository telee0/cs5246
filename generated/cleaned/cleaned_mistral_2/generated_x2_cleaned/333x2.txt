Blackman, who first won the seat in 1997, currently holds a commanding 6,932-vote majority over the Tories. In an interview with local media outlets, Blackman said she was confident in her ability to maintain this lead, citing her strong track record as a dedicated constituency MP.

Blackman has been actively involved in the community since her election, working closely with local councils and charities to improve services for residents. She is particularly proud of her work to combat poverty and homelessness, which she sees as key issues facing the region. Despite these efforts, however, Blackman acknowledges that there are still significant challenges ahead, including rising crime rates and pressure on public services such as healthcare and education.

The Conservative Party has made gains in several other seats in the south east, leading many political observers to speculate that they could win the West Sussex seat in a tight contest. However, Blackman remains unphased by this threat, arguing that her record of service speaks louder than any polls or predictions.

In an effort to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, Blackman has recently announced plans to launch a new campaign focused on promoting job creation and economic growth in the area. By emphasizing these issues, she hopes to demonstrate that she can provide practical solutions to the problems faced by local families and businesses.

Despite the challenges ahead, Blackman remains committed to representing the people of West Sussex and fighting for their rights in Parliament. As she puts it, "I am not just a politician – I am a member of our community, and I want to make sure that we have the resources we need to thrive." Whether it's tackling poverty, creating jobs, or improving public services, Blackman says she will always put the needs of her constituents first.

Overall, while the political landscape may be changing rapidly in recent years, Blackman believes that the fundamentals of good leadership remain the same. For her, this means being transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of those she serves. With these qualities firmly in place, she is optimistic that she can continue to represent West Sussex effectively in the years to come.
