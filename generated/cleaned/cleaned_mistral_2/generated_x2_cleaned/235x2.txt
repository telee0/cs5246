Sandy Walkington, the former MP for Northampton South, has been appointed as the Liberal Democrats’ shadow minister for business and enterprise by new leader Ed Davey. The move comes after Mr Davey announced he would be working closely with other key players within the party to develop their policies ahead of next year's general election. With this new role, Walkington will now work alongside senior figures such as Matthew Taylor on completing the party manifesto.
Party chief executive Lord Rennard said the appointment was a "significant strengthening of the Lib Dem team". He added: “We are pleased that Sandy is joining us as part of our growing team of talented individuals who share our vision for a fairer society.” Walkington's appointment comes at an important time for the party, which has faced criticism over its handling of the UK’s economic recovery following the pandemic. As shadow minister for business and enterprise, Walkington will play a crucial role in shaping the party's approach to these issues.
