According to The Times, Crosby advised party leader Rishi Sunak to prioritize winning more seats in parliament during his tenure as campaign manager. However, Crosby stated through his spokesperson that he did not hold such views and no discussions of this nature ever occurred between him and the Conservatives. This denial comes after reports circulated suggesting that Crosby urged Sunak to aim for a significant gain in the number of MPs held by the ruling party. Despite these claims, the Conservative Party remains focused on its ongoing efforts to strengthen its position in parliament.
