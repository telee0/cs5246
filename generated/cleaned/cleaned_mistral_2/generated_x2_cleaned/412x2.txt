
An estimated 13 million people are still waiting to vote in this year's general election, after being left off the electoral roll due to errors. Those who filled out voter registration forms last autumn should already be included, but those who moved house or went on holiday may have missed the deadline. The issue has raised concerns about voter turnout and the integrity of the democratic process. Election officials say they are working hard to rectify the situation, but it could take several weeks before all eligible voters are added back onto the register. In addition to the general election, there will also be elections for local councils and mayors in parts of England on 5 May. These elections could see a significant number of first-time candidates running, as well as new parties challenging the established order. With so many different races and issues at play, political experts predict that turnout for these local elections will be high. Whether or not you plan to vote in any upcoming elections, it is important to make sure your voice is heard by taking part in the democratic process.
