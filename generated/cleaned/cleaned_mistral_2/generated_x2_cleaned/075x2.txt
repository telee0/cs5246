-----------------------------------------------

The political storm surrounding Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone has intensified after both men made controversial statements regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to expel two Palestinian activists from parliament.

Mr Johnson accused the pair of being part of an orchestrated campaign against Israel, saying their actions were “a blatant attack on democracy”. He went on to claim that Tony Blair’s intervention in the row was “an attempt to reassure Jewish voters”, suggesting that the former PM had prioritised the needs of a specific group above those of all British citizens.

In response, London Mayor Mr Livingstone defended his earlier comments, stating that he was merely drawing attention to what he saw as a hypocritical stance taken by Israel’s leader. He added: “I am standing by my remarks which likened an Evening Standard journalist to a ‘concentration camp guard.’” The journalist in question, David Hirsh, had been invited to give evidence to the Commons International Development Committee but later withdrew due to concerns for his safety following threats from pro-Israel supporters.

This latest controversy comes at a time when tensions between Israel and the international community are already high, particularly with regards to the ongoing construction of settlements in occupied territories. Many critics argue that these developments threaten peace negotiations and undermine efforts to establish a viable Palestinian state.

Meanwhile, Mr Johnson remains under pressure to clarify whether or not he would support sanctions against Israel if it continues its expansionist policies. While he has previously indicated that such measures could be considered, he has since backtracked, claiming that he did not want to cause further tension in the region.

As the debate rages on, it seems clear that this particular issue will continue to divide opinion for the foreseeable future. For now, though, both Mr Johnson and Mr Livingstone appear determined to stand firm on their respective positions – despite the potential fallout they may face from doing so.
