-------------------------------------------------------------

The Conservative Party has launched its general election campaign with the party leader calling for a mass of disillusioned voters. The Tory chief claimed that many people felt betrayed by the former Labour government's policies under Tony Blair.

In his foreword to the Conservatives' manifesto, David Cameron promised to restore order and try to lower taxes while empowering ordinary people to have more say over their lives. He said: "We believe we can offer something different - an alternative vision for our country that will put people first and give them greater control over their own destiny."

Mr Cameron also criticized the previous administration for failing to deliver on key promises made at the last general election, including improving healthcare and education standards.

"People deserve better than they have received from Labour," Mr Cameron said. "They want change, they need change, and we are ready to provide it."

The Conservatives have faced criticism from opponents for being vague in their policy details, but they claim their approach is focused on practical solutions rather than ideological dogma.

Labour MPs have accused the Tories of being too focused on cutting spending rather than investing in public services. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "David Cameron may talk tough about reducing wasteful spending but his track record shows he doesn’t care enough to tackle real issues like waiting times and hospital beds.”

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg welcomed the launch of the manifestos and called on all parties to be honest about what they could achieve if elected.

“It’s time for both Labour and the Conservatives to come clean to the British people about what they really stand for,” he said. “If you want to see how your vote might make a difference then take a look at our manifesto – which sets out clearly what the Lib Dems will do in government.”

As polls continue to suggest a tight race between the two major parties, both sides will be working hard to win over undecided voters. With just weeks left until voting day, it remains to be seen whether Mr Cameron’s message of change will resonate with those who feel let down by past governments.
