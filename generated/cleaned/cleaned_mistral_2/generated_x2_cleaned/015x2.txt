Officials from both sides are expected to attend the meeting, which will take place over two days at the Foreign Office’s headquarters. The agenda is likely to focus on issues such as immigration, trade, and security. It comes after former prime minister Gordon Brown made it clear he was prepared to offer greater autonomy or even independence for the territory if that was what its people wanted. But officials close to the discussions said that any change to the current status quo would require the support of Spain, which currently controls the border into Gibraltar.
