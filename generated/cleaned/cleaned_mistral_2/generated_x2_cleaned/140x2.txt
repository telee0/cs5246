The government has faced criticism for failing to provide adequate support and resources to victims of sexual violence. Many survivors say that they still struggle to come to terms with their experiences and receive proper healthcare and counseling. In recent years, there have also been efforts to prosecute those responsible for these crimes. Some political figures have called for increased accountability and transparency in the justice system, while others have criticized the slow progress of investigations. Despite these challenges, many activists continue to work towards ensuring that justice is served for all those affected by the genocide.
