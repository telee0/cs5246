Buckingham Palace announced today that Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex, will be joining the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on January 27th. This day marks the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at this infamous site during World War II.

The announcement was made by Buckingham Palace as part of its efforts to commemorate the anniversary of one of history's darkest moments. The prince has been a longtime advocate for Holocaust education and remembrance and has visited numerous sites associated with the tragedy, including Auschwitz itself. His presence at the event is seen as an important gesture of solidarity and respect for those who perished in the camps.

In addition to Prince Edward, other dignitaries expected to attend the ceremony include Polish President Andrzej Duda and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It is hoped that their attendance will serve as a powerful reminder of the need to never forget the lessons of history and to continue working towards a world where all people can live free from fear and discrimination.
