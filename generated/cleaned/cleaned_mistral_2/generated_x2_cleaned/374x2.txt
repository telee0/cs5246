In a speech at the party conference, Letwin said: “We cannot afford to stand still while our competitors race ahead.” The tax cuts are expected to be implemented over several years, starting from April next year.

Meanwhile, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has launched a scathing attack on Labour’s record, claiming the government has failed to deliver on its promises and is responsible for rising unemployment and falling living standards. He told delegates: “Labour can no longer claim to be the party of working people. They have abandoned them time after time. It is clear to me now what we need – change, real change.”

As the Conservative Party continues to debate its policy proposals, former prime minister Michael Howard is also due to address the forum later today. He has been criticised by many within his own party for his role in ousting John Major as leader in 1990, but it remains unclear whether he will use this platform to make a statement on his future plans or intentions.

Despite the ongoing debates and discussions within the Conservatives, one thing is certain – the upcoming election will be a crucial moment for the party and the nation as a whole. With polls suggesting a tight race between the two major parties, every vote and every word spoken will be scrutinised closely by voters and political commentators alike.
