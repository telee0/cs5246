In an interview with the BBC, Boris Johnson's wife Carrie Johnson expressed her admiration for the US Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Donald Trump's executive order on the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. According to reports, Mrs. Johnson stated that she believed the court had made the right decision and that it was important to protect the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or status. However, this statement has been met with criticism from many quarters.

The Conservative Party said Mrs. Johnson's actions were unacceptable as they breached the convention that British political figures should refrain from engaging in partisan activities while overseas. It added that the UK government had consistently condemned the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay and that such comments undermined its efforts to promote democracy and human rights globally.

Mrs. Johnson's intervention sparked a debate on whether politicians should be allowed to express their personal views publicly while representing their country. Some argued that Mrs. Johnson had every right to speak out on issues she cared deeply about, but others feared that her actions could harm the UK's diplomatic relations with the United States.

As tensions between the UK and US continue to rise, questions remain about how far politicians can go without risking damaging international cooperation. While Mrs. Johnson may believe she was simply expressing her opinions, the fallout from her comments highlights the complexities surrounding the role of political spouses in modern-day diplomacy.
