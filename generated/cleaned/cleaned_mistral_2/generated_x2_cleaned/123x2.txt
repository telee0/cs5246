These devices have become popular among politicians because they are easy to use and allow them to stay connected while on the move. This week, however, the devices gained new prominence when former Prime Minister Alastair Campbell accidentally sent an offensive message to a reporter from Newsnight using one of these gadgets. It is unclear what he meant by his message, but it has sparked a debate about whether politicians should be allowed to carry such powerful technology. Some experts believe that the government could introduce regulations to limit the amount of sensitive information that politicians can store or transmit using their handsets."
