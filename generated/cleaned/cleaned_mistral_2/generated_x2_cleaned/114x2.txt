As part of its efforts to address these concerns, the city council has announced plans to hold a public consultation on the issue. However, this move has been met with criticism from opposition politicians and activists who say it doesn't go far enough.

One such critic is Green MSP Mark Ballard, who believes the council's proposed approach could lead to unfair outcomes for certain groups of people. Specifically, he worries that individuals who are not included on the council's edited electoral register might be excluded from having their voices heard in the consultation process.

"It's crucial that everyone has an equal chance to have their say," says Ballard. "If we don't include all eligible voters, then we risk making decisions that don't accurately reflect the needs and opinions of the community as a whole."

In response to these concerns, the council has pledged to work closely with community leaders and organizations to ensure that everyone has access to the necessary information and resources. They also plan to reach out to those who may not typically participate in political processes to encourage them to take part in the consultation.

Despite these efforts, however, critics continue to question whether the proposed congestion charge would truly benefit the city or simply exacerbate existing problems. Some argue that alternative solutions, such as investing in public transportation or promoting cycling and walking, should be considered before imposing new taxes on drivers.

Overall, the debate over congestion charging in Edinburgh remains highly polarized, with both supporters and opponents citing a range of factors to make their case. As the consultation process begins, it remains to be seen which side will ultimately prevail – but one thing is clear: the future of transportation in the city will be shaped by careful consideration of the views and needs of all stakeholders involved.
