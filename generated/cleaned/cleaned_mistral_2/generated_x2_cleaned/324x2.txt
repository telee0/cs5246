In recent weeks, there have been allegations that Downing Street exerted pressure on former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to provide misleading evidence to parliament regarding the Iraq War. These claims were first reported by journalist Peter Wilmott and are now being investigated by MPs on the Commons Justice Committee.

However, Downing Street has strongly denied these allegations, stating in a statement that there is no truth to them whatsoever. According to the government, Lord Goldsmith gave his independent legal opinion on the matter based on all available information at the time. The statement went on to say that Downing Street had always respected the independence of its advisors and would never seek to undermine their credibility or influence.

Lord Goldsmith himself has also come out to deny the allegations, stating that he was not "leaned on" in any way by Downing Street officials. He said that he provided his honest assessment of the situation based on his own analysis and did not feel pressured to do anything other than give an accurate account of his findings.

Despite this denial, some politicians have called for further investigation into the matter, arguing that if such allegations were true then it could have serious implications for the integrity of British democracy. They argue that if Downing Street was able to influence Lord Goldsmith's decision-making process, then it raises questions about the independence of judicial institutions and the rule of law.

Article 2: Attempt to Suppress Information About Iraq War Leads to Legal Challenge

Another controversial issue surrounding the Iraq War has emerged following a court battle over documents related to the conflict. In February 2016, campaign group Peace Action Trust (PAT) submitted a freedom of information request to Whitehall seeking details of UK military contracts awarded during the war. However, after several months of delays and refusals, PAT launched a legal challenge against the Ministry of Defence (MoD), arguing that it was trying to suppress important information from the public.

After a lengthy court hearing, the judge ruled in favour of PAT, ordering the MoD to release the requested documents within 35 days. This marked a significant victory for transparency advocates who believe that governments should be held accountable for their actions during conflicts.

The case also highlighted concerns about the use of private contractors in Iraq, many of whom have faced accusations of human rights abuses and fraudulent billing practices. Some critics argue that outsourcing key functions to private companies can lead to a lack of oversight and accountability, making it harder to hold those responsible for wrongdoing to justice.

Article 3: Political Divisions Deepen Over Brexit negotiations

As the UK continues to negotiate its exit from the European Union, political divisions have deepened among both Conservative and Labour parties. Many Conservatives are pushing for a hard Brexit, which would involve leaving the EU without access to its single market or customs union, while others fear this could damage trade relations with the rest of Europe.

Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbin has expressed his support for staying in the EU and has criticised Prime Minister Theresa May's handling of the negotiations so far. However, despite these differences, both sides have agreed to work together to find a solution that benefits Britain as a whole.

Some experts predict that negotiations will become increasingly fraught in the coming months, with tensions rising between different factions within each party. As such, it remains unclear how long it will take for the UK to secure its desired outcome and whether this will involve a hard or soft Brexit.
