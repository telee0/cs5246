A major political scandal has shaken the foundations of British democracy after it emerged that thousands of unaccountable votes could have been cast in last year's English local elections. The shocking revelation came to light when police discovered three men handling a stash of unsealed ballots in a warehouse on the outskirts of a major city in June 2004.

The votes were later counted towards the same month's local elections, which had far-reaching implications for the future of the country. It is now believed that the actions of this small but determined group of people could have tipped the balance of power in several key council races across the nation.

At an emergency hearing into the affair yesterday, witnesses described how they stumbled upon the trio in the middle of the night as they searched for evidence of election fraud. They claimed that the men appeared to be trying to open up the sealed envelopes containing the voters' decisions and count them by hand.

"We were shocked at what we found," one officer testified. "These guys had no business being anywhere near these ballots – let alone opening them up."

It is not yet clear how many votes were affected by the discovery, but officials say that any irregularities could have had serious consequences for those who lost their seats or failed to win new ones.

In response to the allegations, the government announced today that it would launch a full-scale investigation into the incident and review all aspects of postal voting procedures.

Labour MP Tom Watson, who has campaigned tirelessly against electoral fraud, welcomed the move but called on the authorities to go further.

"This is just the tip of the iceberg," he said. "We need a root-and-branch review of our entire electoral system if we are ever going to restore public trust in our institutions."

The controversy surrounding postal voting has long simmered beneath the surface of British politics, with critics arguing that the practice is rife with opportunities for abuse and manipulation. In recent years, there have been numerous instances where ballots have gone missing or turned up tampered with, leading many to question whether the method is truly secure enough to guarantee free and fair elections.

Yesterday's hearing also heard from experts who warned that even seemingly minor flaws in the process could have disastrous consequences for democracy itself.

Dr John Gray, a professor of political science at Oxford University, said: "Postal voting is an important innovation that allows us to engage more citizens in our democratic processes than ever before. But if it can be so easily corrupted, then it threatens everything we hold dear about our society and its values."

As the debate over the future of postal voting continues, one thing is certain: the integrity of Britain's elections will remain under close scrutiny for the foreseeable future.
