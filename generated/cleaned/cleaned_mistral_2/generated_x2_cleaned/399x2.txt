The conservative party is facing a political scandal as it has been revealed that their candidate for Arundel and South Downs, Nick Flite, is not eligible to run for election. This news comes despite claims from his supporters that he had sufficient backing to hold a meeting to discuss his future within the party.

According to Russell Tanguay, an agent for the Arundel and South Downs Tories, Flite does not meet the necessary qualifications to stand as a candidate for the upcoming general election. Tanguay stated that the association was actively searching for a replacement for Flite, who had previously expressed his desire to continue representing the area.

Despite this revelation, Flite's allies have insisted that they have gathered enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his future within the party. They argue that Flite remains popular among voters and should be given another opportunity to represent the community. However, these efforts may ultimately prove futile as Flite's eligibility issues cannot be ignored or resolved easily.

This latest development has sparked outrage from opposition parties, who are calling on the conservative party to act quickly and transparently regarding Flite's status as a candidate. Some have accused the party of trying to cover up Flite's ineligibility in order to maintain their majority in the area. The Conservatives, however, deny any wrongdoing and claim that the issue was simply an administrative mistake.

As the election approaches, the conservative party will need to address this matter head-on and provide clarity on Flite's candidacy. Failing to do so could result in a loss of trust among voters, who rely on the party to act in their best interests. It is also possible that the party may face legal challenges if they attempt to field an ineligible candidate.

In other political news, tensions between the UK government and EU member states continue to escalate over Brexit negotiations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently made a controversial statement suggesting that the UK would leave the European Union without a deal if necessary. This comment angered many EU leaders, who have warned that such a move would lead to devastating economic consequences for both sides.

Meanwhile, the US presidential race continues to heat up as candidates prepare for the first primary debates. Democratic hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have emerged as strong contenders, challenging frontrunner Joe Biden on issues such as healthcare reform and income inequality. Republicans Donald Trump and Pete Buttigieg have also been active in recent days, campaigning across key battleground states.

Overall, this week has been marked by significant developments in the world of politics. From the ongoing debate surrounding Flite's eligibility to the growing tension between the UK and EU, there is no shortage of important stories to follow closely. As we approach the end of the week, it will be interesting to see how these events unfold and what impact they may have on global affairs.
