The Register reports that he made the money through his role as an adviser for a private equity firm called Bridgepoint Capital. It is also reported that he earned £491,000 last year from Bridgepoint Capital for his role as an advisor. This brings his total earnings since he left office in May 2015 to £7 million.

Michael Portillo has also been named as one of the highest earners among ex-politicians, making up to £560,000 a year from various sources including speeches and TV work. He was previously the shadow chancellor under Tony Blair before becoming Tory party chairman. According to the report, he also receives a pension worth £128,000 a year.

It's not just the ex-Tories who are earning big bucks. Several other politicians have also been revealed as high earners. These include Lord Mandelson, who made £438,000 in consulting fees last year, and Sir David Gauke, who received £300,000 in consultancy fees from several firms.

These figures come as no surprise given the lucrative nature of the political landscape today. Politicians can command high salaries for their roles in government or as advisors to private companies. They can also make significant amounts of money from their expertise by giving speeches at conferences or appearing on television programs.

While these numbers may seem impressive, there are concerns about transparency when it comes to how much politicians are actually earning. Some critics argue that politicians should be required to disclose all sources of income and provide detailed records of any payments they receive. Others believe that this would simply stifle innovation and deter people from entering politics altogether.

Despite these debates, one thing remains clear: politics is now more profitable than ever before. And while many people enter the political arena with noble intentions, others do it purely for financial gain. As such, there will always be questions about the motives behind the actions of our elected officials.
