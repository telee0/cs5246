The NAO found that costs for the 20 biggest defence projects have soared by £1.7 billion in just one year, despite the introduction of a smart acquisition policy six years ago. The watchdog warned there is little evidence to suggest that the MoD’s performance has improved and urged it to take immediate action to improve cost control.

The findings will be particularly embarrassing for the MoD, which has been grappling with spiralling costs and delays for several high-profile projects. For example, the flagship F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jet project has faced numerous setbacks and cost overruns, with estimates suggesting that costs could rise by another £800 million. The NAO also highlighted the troubled development of the Astute Class nuclear submarine programme, which has seen costs spiral by almost £600 million since the start of the project.

Critics have accused the MoD of being too focused on acquiring new technology at any cost, without properly considering the long-term implications. The Smart Acquisition Policy was intended to streamline procurement processes and ensure better value for money, but the NAO found that this approach had not led to significant improvements in cost control or efficiency.

The NAO also raised concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability within the MoD. There were instances where contractors were able to hide errors and defects from the department, leading to potential risks to personnel and equipment. This highlights the need for greater oversight and scrutiny of defence spending to prevent future cost blowouts and protect taxpayers.

Despite these criticisms, the MoD insists that it remains committed to improving its performance. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “We agree with the NAO that more needs to be done to drive down costs and improve efficiency in our procurement process. We are already taking steps to address these issues, including establishing an internal review into the F-35 programme.” However, critics argue that these measures may be too little, too late, given the sheer scale of the cost overruns and delays.

Overall, the NAO report serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the UK government when it comes to managing defence spending. As tensions with other countries continue to escalate, there is a growing concern that the UK is becoming increasingly reliant on expensive military hardware to maintain its position on the world stage. With rising costs and dwindling resources, the government must urgently rethink its strategy for defending the nation and ensuring good value for taxpayer money.
