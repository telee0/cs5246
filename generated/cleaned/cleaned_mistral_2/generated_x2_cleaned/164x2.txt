During his speech to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday, former First Minister Jack McConnell formally conveyed Scotland's condolences to those affected by the disaster. The figures were released following the announcement and have been widely acknowledged as an enormous loss of life. It is hoped that the international community will continue to come together in support of the survivors and work towards rebuilding efforts in the devastated areas.
