According to Mr Blair, he believes that his actions speak louder than any words ever could when it comes to attacking Mr Howard's political tactics. He stated that he has always been open and honest about his opinions, and that if someone disagrees with them, they are free to challenge him. However, Mr Blair added that he does not believe in engaging in personal attacks or insulting language towards anyone.

Mr Blair also took aim at recent Labor campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which he claimed were "anti-Semitic." He said that such behavior is completely unacceptable, regardless of whether it is done by members of his own party or by others. The posters, he explained, made use of imagery and language that was intended to be offensive and hurtful to Jews. He went on to say that while he had nothing personally against Mr Howard, he did not support these types of attacks or propaganda.

When asked about his plans for the future, Mr Blair expressed confidence that he would continue to lead the government until the next general election. He said that he had always believed that leadership was about making difficult decisions and standing up for what was right, even when faced with opposition and criticism. While he acknowledged that there were challenges ahead, he remained committed to working hard and doing everything within his power to ensure that Britain continued to thrive and prosper.

Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding Mr Blair's tenure as prime minister, many people still see him as an important figure in British politics. Some have praised his efforts to improve healthcare, education, and other aspects of public life, while others have criticized him for his role in the Iraq War and various other issues. Regardless of where one stands on these matters, however, there can be no denying the significant impact that Mr Blair has had on the course of UK history during his time in office. As he continues to work towards the end of his term, Mr Blair will undoubtedly remain a major player in shaping the future of British politics.
