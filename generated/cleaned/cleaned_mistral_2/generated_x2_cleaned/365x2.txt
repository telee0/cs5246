The Chancellor said that 12,500 jobs would be lost over the next two years, while an additional 7,800 jobs would be relocated from London and other high-cost areas.

The move is expected to have a significant impact on the UK economy, particularly in the North West and Scotland where many public sector jobs are concentrated. However, the chancellor argued that the cuts would enable him to invest more heavily in education, healthcare, defense, housing, and international aid.

"This is not something we want or need," he told MPs. "But it is what we must do if we are going to build a better Britain."

Brown also outlined plans to reform the welfare system to ensure that those receiving benefits were able to work and contribute to society. This includes introducing a new benefit cap which will limit how much claimants can receive each week. In addition, Brown announced plans to introduce a national minimum wage of £9 per hour, which he claimed would help low-paid workers and boost consumer spending.

Critics of the budget package argue that cutting too deeply could harm the UK's economic recovery and lead to higher unemployment rates. They also point out that previous rounds of public sector cuts under Brown's leadership have led to widespread job losses and rising living costs. However, supporters of the measures believe they will ultimately lead to greater efficiency and productivity within the public sector, allowing for long-term investment in essential services and infrastructure.
