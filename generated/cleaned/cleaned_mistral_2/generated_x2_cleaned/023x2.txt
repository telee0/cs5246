After being launched just two years ago, the e-University has been shut down due to its poor performance. The institution attracted only 900 students during its first year, which is much lower than expected. This came at a great financial cost as it cost the government an astonishing 50 million pounds.

Despite this, the university's chief executive, John Beaumont, received a substantial bonus payment worth 44,914 pounds for his role in leading the failed project. Many are outraged by this move as they believe that he should have faced consequences for not meeting the expectations set for him.

This event highlights the dangers of overconfidence in technology-based projects. While there may be advantages to using digital platforms for education, it is important to remember that these tools can also fail if not implemented properly. In addition, the high cost of launching and maintaining an e-University suggests that such institutions may not always be financially viable without significant investment from outside parties.

Political analysts argue that this incident could serve as a warning sign for other educational institutions looking to follow suit and establish their own online universities. They suggest that careful consideration must be given to the feasibility of such initiatives before any resources are allocated to them.

In conclusion, the failure of the e-University serves as a reminder of the importance of thorough planning and execution when implementing new technological projects. It is hoped that politicians will take note of this lesson and ensure that similar mistakes do not occur again in the future.
