This move is part of a wider package aimed at improving family life and reducing the burden on working mothers. The Labour government also wants to give fathers the right to take paternity leave and extend parental rights for those who care for their children beyond infancy.

Ms Hewitt said: “We know that many families are struggling to make ends meet and we want to help them out as much as possible. That’s why we have introduced these changes.”

The new measures will be phased in over the next few years, but the aim is to create a more flexible approach to work-life balance. Under the proposals, employees will be able to take longer periods off work without losing income. This could be especially helpful for women who want to continue their careers while raising a family.

The government has been under pressure from campaigners such as MumsNet to introduce more generous maternity policies. However, there are concerns that increasing paid leave could harm businesses by reducing productivity. Some employers may choose to reduce staff or increase costs to cover the extra expense.

Despite this, the government believes that it can find ways to fund its proposed changes without putting too much strain on businesses. One idea is to use unspent money allocated for other purposes, such as education or health. Another option is to encourage companies to adopt more flexible working arrangements, which could help to ease the burden on parents.

However, critics argue that these ideas do not go far enough. They say that the current system of parental leave is still too restrictive and does not provide adequate support for families. In particular, they point out that only one in five men takes any form of paternity leave.

To address this issue, some politicians have called for a radical shakeup of the way parenting works. For example, they suggest that parents should be able to share their leave equally, regardless of gender. Others argue that fathers should be entitled to more than just two weeks of paternity leave after a baby is born.

Overall, the debate about parental leave continues. But whatever happens, it seems clear that there is no easy solution to the challenges facing working families. With so many competing priorities, finding a way to strike a balance between work and home life remains a difficult task.
