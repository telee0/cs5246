Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable has warned that concerns over Iraq and other global issues are likely to surface during the election campaign. In an interview, he said that voters will be concerned with both international conflicts such as Syria and domestic problems like Brexit when they go to polls next year.

"It's clear that there is a lot of concern out there among people," Cable said. "They want us to focus on what really matters - things like jobs, education, healthcare, and the environment. We need to address these issues head-on if we want to win back public trust."

Cable's remarks came just days after an independent review was launched into how to increase voter turnout for future elections. The inquiry aims to identify ways to make voting more accessible and engaging for young people and minorities who tend to have lower voter participation rates.

As part of the effort to improve democracy, many political parties are looking closely at their own campaigns. They are trying to find new ways to connect with potential voters and appeal to their concerns. For example, Labour has promised to invest in schools and hospitals, while Conservatives have focused on reducing taxes and promoting growth.

But despite their different approaches, all the major parties agree that addressing the needs of ordinary voters will be crucial to winning their support. With only weeks left until the general election, time is running short for them to convince voters why they should choose their party over the others.
