However, this has been denied by Crosby himself who stated he did not hold this view or have any such discussion with Mr Johnson. The controversy continues to escalate as the Conservatives attempt to maintain their lead in the polls amid growing concerns about Brexit negotiations. It remains unclear what impact Crosby’s involvement will have on the outcome of the election.
