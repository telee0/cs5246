During his visit, he spoke passionately about the need for nations to uphold the enduring British values of liberty and tolerance. He emphasized that these principles were not exclusive to Europe but needed to be embraced globally. His message resonated well with many of the leaders he met, who agreed that such values were essential for peaceful coexistence and sustainable development.

During his trip, Brown also signed a debt relief deal with Tanzania worth £1 billion. This move is expected to have a positive impact on both countries' economies and boost their cooperation in various sectors. The agreement will provide much-needed funds to help the Tanzanian government invest in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. In return, the UK hopes to gain access to natural resources and markets in Africa.

Brown's visit to Africa has been seen as a significant step towards building stronger relations between Britain and the continent. It comes at a time when global economic instability poses a challenge to many developing nations, including those in Africa. By providing financial assistance and promoting trade, Brown hopes to create a win-win situation where everyone benefits.

Despite facing criticism from some quarters over the decision to sign the debt relief deal, Brown defended his actions saying it was necessary for long term stability. He argued that by relieving the burden of debt, the Tanzanian government would be better equipped to focus on poverty reduction and social welfare. Moreover, the agreement was a demonstration of Britain's commitment to working closely with African nations to achieve common goals.

Overall, Brown's tour of Africa has been viewed as a success, as he managed to promote British values while securing vital economic interests. With increasing attention being given to Africa due to its vast potential, this trip marks an important chapter in Britain's engagement with the region.
