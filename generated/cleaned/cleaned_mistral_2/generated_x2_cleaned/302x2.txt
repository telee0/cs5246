Mr Galloway won 150,000 pounds in libel damages against the Daily Telegraph last week and has used this victory as an opportunity to launch his campaign. He is expected to contest Bethnal Green, a working-class area in east London where Respect has been making gains in recent years.

Galloway's decision to enter the race comes after months of speculation about his political future. Since being expelled from Labour following his outspoken criticism of the Iraq war, Galloway has continued to speak out against what he sees as a lack of integrity and leadership within the mainstream parties. His announcement of intent to run for parliament marks the next step in his journey towards becoming a viable alternative voice in British politics.

In addition to his work within Respect, Galloway has also become known for his fiery speeches and media appearances. He has been particularly critical of the government's handling of the refugee crisis, calling it "a shameful betrayal of human decency". In recent weeks, he has also spoken out about his concerns over the rise of far-right movements in Europe, warning that these groups pose a serious threat to democratic values.

As the election approaches, many are eagerly watching how the various candidates will shape their campaigns. While Galloway's entry into the race may be viewed by some as a risky move, others see it as a much needed injection of fresh ideas and perspectives into the political landscape. Regardless of how the race unfolds, one thing is certain: George Galloway will not shy away from speaking his mind, no matter how uncomfortable or unpopular it may be at times.
