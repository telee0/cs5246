Speaking outside Number 10 on Tuesday afternoon, Johnson said he believed the public had faith in him to lead them through these turbulent times and bring stability to Britain.

Johnson's comments came following a heated exchange with EU leaders during the weekend, where he failed to agree on key terms for a post-Brexit trade deal. However, he remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached by November 30th. The deadline is looming large as it could trigger a no-deal scenario.

The prime minister also emphasized the importance of maintaining unity within the party, saying that it was essential for a strong showing in the upcoming polls. This comes amidst growing tensions between different factions within the Tory ranks. Some MPs have called for a second referendum, while others are staunchly opposed to any further vote on the issue.

In contrast to Johnson, opposition leader Jeremy Corbin has been more critical of his approach to Brexit, stating that the government had not done enough to protect the rights of UK citizens living abroad or those from other countries working here. He believes that if elected, his Labour government would prioritize these issues and work towards creating a fairer society.

As the campaign gathers momentum, both sides are making promises to win over undecided voters. Johnson claims to have created jobs and increased wages since coming into power three years ago, while Corbyn promises to nationalize industries and invest heavily in healthcare and education.

However, many experts predict a close result in the election, with several factors such as turnout levels, voter fatigue, and even weather conditions likely to play a role. In addition, there are concerns about voter suppression tactics being employed by various groups, which could impact the final outcome.

Despite these uncertainties, one thing remains clear – this will be a decisive moment for the future of the United Kingdom. Whether it is under Johnson's leadership or Corbyn's vision for change, voters will determine whether they want to continue with the current political trajectory or embark on a new path forward.
