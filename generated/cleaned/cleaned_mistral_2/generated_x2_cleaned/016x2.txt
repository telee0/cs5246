The Commons Science and Technology Committee has warned that the UK will face significant challenges if this issue is not addressed urgently.

The committee’s chairperson, Dr Sarah Woolley, said: “We were shocked by the sheer scale of the crisis we found when investigating this area.” She added that the shortage of skilled staff had resulted in poor-quality data analysis being used to inform policy decisions. This has led to a number of high-profile errors, including those made during the pandemic response.

According to the committee’s report, the problem has worsened significantly since the 2016 Brexit referendum, which saw many experienced analysts leave government due to uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK outside the European Union. Since then, the government has struggled to attract new talent into these roles, leading to a sharp drop in the number of available positions.

This situation is set to get even worse in the coming years as the current generation of statisticians and social scientists reaches retirement age. Major problems are expected over the next decade as the workforce continues to shrink, leaving the government vulnerable to further data failures.

Dr Woolley added: “Governments rely on accurate data analysis to make informed decisions, so it is crucial that they take immediate action to address this crisis.” She called for increased investment in training programs and better pay and conditions to help attract and retain top talent in the field.
