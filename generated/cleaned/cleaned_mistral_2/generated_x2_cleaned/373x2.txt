The German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble spoke out against reducing spending and called on member states to increase contributions to the EU's coffers. However, other countries, including France and Italy, argued that this could lead to economic instability and demanded more flexibility in the budgeting process.

Speaking after the summit, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso expressed his frustration with the lack of agreement on financing issues. He warned that failure to reach a deal could lead to a crisis in the eurozone, which could have serious consequences for the world economy. "We cannot allow ourselves to be paralysed by short-term thinking," said Barroso. "It is essential that we find a solution to our financial problems as soon as possible."

The UK played a key role in shaping the outcome of the meeting, with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pushing hard for a reduction in the rebate paid to Britain under Margaret Thatcher's leadership in 1984. However, other member states were unwilling to agree to such changes, fearing that it would undermine their own economies. As a result, the issue remains unresolved, with no clear timeline for when it will next be discussed.

The ongoing debate over funding has been fueled by concerns about rising deficits across Europe, particularly in Greece and Portugal. These countries are struggling to meet their obligations to the EU and are facing pressure from creditors to implement reforms. In addition, there are fears that the growing divide between rich and poor within Europe could exacerbate these tensions and make it even harder for the bloc to come together on important issues like funding.

Despite these challenges, there are signs that individual member states are taking steps to address their own fiscal woes. For example, Spain recently implemented new austerity measures in order to reduce its deficit, while Germany has announced cuts worth €50 billion over the next four years. While these efforts may not go far enough to resolve the underlying problem, they demonstrate a willingness among members of the EU to take action and work towards a sustainable future.

However, the overall mood among EU leaders was one of frustration and uncertainty, with many expressing concern about the future direction of the bloc. With no clear resolution in sight on issues like financing, immigration, and terrorism, there is increasing anxiety about what lies ahead for the EU and its members. As one leader put it, "We need to find a way forward before things get worse."
