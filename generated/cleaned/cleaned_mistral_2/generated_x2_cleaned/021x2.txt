In his first major address since becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson used a visit to Scotland to set out his vision for the UK’s future outside of Europe, as he tried to win over voters who backed Brexit but remain sceptical of leaving the EU without a deal. He told a packed hall in Edinburgh: “Today I want to tell you how we are going to take our country forward into the future.” Mr Johnson also promised to create jobs and increase wages across the UK, while pledging to maintain the integrity of the union at all times. The PM added: “We must not let anyone tear us apart – we are stronger together than ever before.”
2. Theresa May has launched an attack on Jeremy Corbin, accusing him of being too soft on Russia and failing to hold Moscow accountable for its actions in Syria. Mrs May made her comments during a speech to MPs, where she also accused the Labour leader of being weak on immigration, crime and terrorism.

He said: “I think what we need now more than anything else is a sense of unity in the face of the greatest challenge this country has faced for generations.”

During the talks, Mr Trump had expressed concern over the impact of the accord on US businesses, particularly those operating overseas. However, despite pressure from France, the US president ultimately decided to pull out of the agreement, citing concerns about job losses and the burden it placed on American taxpayers. The move will likely anger environmentalists and other world leaders, who had hoped the US would continue to play a key role in global efforts to combat climate change.
5. The ongoing trade war between the US and China has led to a significant slowdown in the global economy, according to new research from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF forecasts that economic growth worldwide will fall to 3% this year, down from 3.5% in 2018.
