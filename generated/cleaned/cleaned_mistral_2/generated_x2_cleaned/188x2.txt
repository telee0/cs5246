According to reports, the UK government is planning to allow Musharraf to enter the country despite his involvement in human rights abuses during his rule in Pakistan. This decision has faced criticism from many politicians and human rights organizations who have called on Prime Minister Theresa May to reconsider her stance.
2) As part of the preparations for Musharraf's visit, it has emerged that Scottish authorities are taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of the ex-president. Sources close to the situation have revealed that the files containing information about the security arrangements for Musharraf's trip are being held by Scotland Yard. It is believed that these documents include detailed plans for the policing operation that will be put into place to protect Musharraf during his stay in the UK.
3) However, it appears that these efforts may not be enough to satisfy all concerned parties. Some opposition MPs have raised concerns about the wisdom of allowing Musharraf to come to the UK at all, given the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India. Additionally, there are fears that any public demonstration against Musharraf could escalate into violence and cause chaos on the streets of London.
4) In response to these concerns, Scotland Yard has confirmed that it has taken steps to review its approach to dealing with Musharraf. While they have refused to comment further on their specific plans, they have stated that they will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both Musharraf and members of the public during his visit. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his arrival, many Pakistanis living in the UK are excited about the prospect of seeing their former leader again after so long.
