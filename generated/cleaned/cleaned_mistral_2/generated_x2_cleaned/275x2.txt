
The UK government has faced criticism over its budget proposals after Labour accused them of cutting too much and being too generous to the wealthy. However, Chancellor Philip Hammond has defended the package, saying it is a plan for the Tories' first Budget and he hopes to be able to go further.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbin claimed that the proposed cuts were too deep and could lead to job losses and increased poverty. He also criticised the government for giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting funding for public services like healthcare and education.
Despite this opposition, the government remains confident in its ability to deliver on its promises. The Tories on Monday highlighted £35bn in "wasteful" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. They also announced plans to increase the national living wage by 1p per hour next year.
However, critics argue that these measures will not be enough to address the challenges facing the UK economy. Many have called for the government to invest more in infrastructure projects and create new jobs to stimulate growth.
As tensions continue to rise between the two main parties, there are concerns that the upcoming Brexit negotiations could make things even worse. Some experts fear that a no-deal scenario could lead to economic chaos and uncertainty in the UK.
Meanwhile, other countries around the world are watching closely to see what happens. The EU has already warned the UK that it must make progress on its Brexit negotiating position if it wants to avoid a hard border with Ireland.
In light of all of this, it seems clear that political instability will remain a major issue in the UK for the foreseeable future. Whether or not the government can navigate these challenges and come up with a solution that works for everyone remains to be seen.
