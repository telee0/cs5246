The former foreign secretary, who was previously education and health minister before taking on the role of foreign affairs, will need to win back support from many members of his own party after being seen as weak during the Iraq War. In addition, Mr Miliband will have to deal with the ongoing economic crisis and rising unemployment levels. Despite this, he remains popular among voters and is expected to lead Labour into its fourth general election victory in a row in 2015.
