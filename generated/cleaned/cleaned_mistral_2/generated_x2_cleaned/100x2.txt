The allegation comes as tensions between Britain and Cuba continue to simmer. The UK government has been accused of failing to do enough to free Mubanga, who claims to have been kidnapped by intelligence agencies while visiting the country in August last year. He is currently being held in Camp Guantánamo Bay, where he is subjected to torture and other forms of abuse.

Mubanga's lawyer, David Headley, told the Observer that there were strong indications that an MI6 agent had played a pivotal role in his client's detention. "We are extremely concerned," Headley said. "If true, it would be a betrayal of everything that this country stands for."

Headley added that he believed Mubanga had been captured because of his association with a dissident group operating within Cuba. "He has never committed any crime against anyone," Headley said. "His only crime is his political beliefs."

The alleged involvement of MI6 agents in Mubanga's case will undoubtedly fuel further speculation about the agency's activities in Cuba. It follows reports earlier this year that MI6 had established a secret safe house on the island nation, which could potentially be used as a base for covert operations.

Critics of Britain's relationship with Cuba argue that the UK has been too slow to condemn the human rights abuses perpetrated by Fidel Castro's regime. They claim that the government has failed to take action to secure Mubanga's release, despite numerous appeals from activists and international organizations.

"It is disgraceful that our government continues to maintain good relations with a country that routinely violates basic human rights,” said Amnesty International spokesperson Kate Allen. "We cannot condone such actions and must call upon the UK government to do more to bring justice to victims like Martin Mubanga."

The British Foreign Office denied any knowledge of Mubanga's arrest or detention, but said that it was deeply troubled by reports of human rights abuses in Cuba. "We urge the Cuban authorities to respect their own commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to work towards greater freedom and democracy," a spokesman said.

But critics say that these statements ring hollow given the UK's history of supporting authoritarian regimes in Latin America, including those run by dictators like Pinochet in Chile and Duvalier in Haiti.

"Our foreign policy is often hypocritical," said Labour MP Tom Watson, who has been vocal in his support for Mubanga's release. "We talk about promoting democracy and human rights, but when it comes to practice, we frequently fall short. This is particularly true when dealing with countries like Cuba, which we see as strategically important."

In addition to Mubanga, several other Britons are also reportedly being held in Guantánamo Bay. These include Shaker Aamer, a Saudi national who was cleared of terrorism charges and should have been released years ago; Lee Rigby, a soldier killed by Islamist extremists outside Wootton Basset military base in 2014; and Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist murdered by the Saudi Arabian government in Turkey last month.

As the situation in Cuba continues to deteriorate, it remains unclear what the future holds for Mubanga and the other prisoners held in Guantánamo Bay. But one thing is clear – the UK government needs to do more to ensure that its citizens are treated fairly and humanely, regardless of their political views.
