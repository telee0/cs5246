The United States has been under pressure to shift its focus away from the so-called "Axis of Evil," which includes North Korea, Iran and Iraq. According to political expert Amitai Etzioni, this emphasis is misplaced as it fails to address the root cause of many conflicts, namely weak and corrupt governments that are unable to control their own borders.

Instead, he argues, the world needs to pay closer attention to "failing states" such as Russia and Pakistan, both of whom possess nuclear weapons but lack the ability to secure them effectively. This could potentially lead to a catastrophic event if these materials were to fall into the wrong hands.

Etzioni also believes that the international community must do more to help stabilize struggling democracies by providing financial assistance, technical expertise and training to improve governance and infrastructure. He stresses that this would not only benefit the people living in these countries but also prevent future crises and reduce the chances of armed conflict breaking out.

Despite his warnings, there have been those who argue that the United States needs to continue targeting rogue states due to their perceived links to terrorism. However, Etzioni counters that terror groups can operate anywhere, making it crucial to address underlying issues such as poverty, inequality and political instability.

In conclusion, Amitai Etzioni highlights the importance of recognizing the role played by weak and corrupt governments in destabilizing regions around the globe. While the US has taken steps to combat terrorism, it needs to consider how best to tackle the root causes of violence, particularly in failing states where nuclear weapons are at risk of falling into the wrong hands. By doing so, the international community may be able to promote peace and stability while ensuring that no country poses an imminent threat to global security.
