He had always been known for his strong conservative views and had spoken out against what he believed were overly liberal policies being implemented by the Scottish government. However, it appears that these views have now led to his downfall.

According to reports, Mr Houston's suspension came after he wrote an email expressing his opinions on various political issues to two Scottish newspapers. The content of the emails is not yet known, but sources claim that they contained language that could be considered offensive or inflammatory. It is also unclear exactly why Mr Houston was suspended specifically, but it is understood that he has been removed from the list of candidates set to run in the upcoming general election.

The move to suspend Mr Houston has sparked controversy both locally and nationally. Some are calling it an attack on freedom of speech, while others argue that it is necessary to maintain a certain level of decorum and professionalism within the political sphere. Regardless of where people stand, there is no denying that this case will have far-reaching consequences for the future of politics in Scotland.

Mr Houston himself has yet to comment on the situation, though his friends and supporters are rallying behind him. They say that he should never have been suspended simply for expressing his opinions, and that his removal from the ballot paper represents a blow to democratic principles. Whatever happens, one thing is clear: John Houston's career in politics looks like it may be over before it even began.
