In a move that will disappoint homeowners and security advocates alike, the government has ruled out amending the present law on self-defense to allow for greater protection against intruders. This decision comes despite calls from opposition parties and even the Prime Minister himself to reform the current laws.

Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, stating, "It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars." His comments come after several high-profile break-ins where homeowners have been left feeling vulnerable due to the existing laws. The ruling party had previously indicated that they were open to making changes to the law, but recent events appear to have caused them to change their minds.

The decision to keep the status quo has sparked criticism from opponents of the government. They argue that the current legal system does little to deter potential thieves and leaves homeowners feeling exposed. Some have even gone so far as to say that the government is putting its own interests before the safety of ordinary people.

However, supporters of the government argue that the law is necessary to prevent overreach by law enforcement agencies. They believe that allowing greater latitude in the use of force would lead to more innocent people being wrongly accused or arrested.

The debate on self-defense legislation has raged on for years, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, it appears that the ruling party has decided to side with the status quo at least for now. It remains to be seen whether this decision will ultimately be popular with voters or if further pressure from opposition parties will result in future reforms.
