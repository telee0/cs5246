He explained, “I think it is possible that a small number of our people will switch to the Conservatives because they are concerned that we don't have strong enough policies to deal with this.”

However, former prime minister Tony Blair’s successor, Gordon Brown, disagreed with this notion. In response to Mr. Griffin’s comments, Mr. Brown emphasized that the Tory and BNP parties had fundamentally different ideologies and were not appealing to the same voter base. He argued, “The Conservatives have always stood for freedom and democracy, and I believe there is no comparison between what we stand for and what the BNP stands for.”

Mr. Brown went further by stating that he believed the BNP’s message was one of fear and division rather than hope and opportunity. He added, “We need to be united as a country, working together to build a better future, not divided along lines of race or religion.”

While the debate continues over whether the Tories and BNP appeal to similar voter groups, many political analysts suggest that there may be some overlap in terms of demographics such as age, class, and education level. However, it remains unclear how significant this overlap might be, and whether it translates into actual electoral support for either party.
