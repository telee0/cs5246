The Downing Street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later in the week. The UK government has been under increasing pressure from Turkish leaders and supporters to support their country's inclusion in the EU. Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU. He believes that Turkey would greatly benefit economically from joining the EU and that it could serve as a valuable ally in the fight against terrorism. However, there are concerns among some member states about Turkey's human rights record and its treatment of minority groups. The UK will be working closely with other EU countries to address these issues before making any final decisions on whether to admit Turkey into the bloc.
