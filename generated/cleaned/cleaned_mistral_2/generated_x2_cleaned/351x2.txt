Labour leader Tony Blair has launched a scathing attack on the Tory party, accusing them of offering a "hard right agenda" following their controversial decision to back the invasion of Iraq. In response, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox slammed Blair for lying about the reasons behind the conflict.

Fox's comments came during an interview with BBC Radio where he criticised Blair for not being honest with the public regarding the motivations behind the war. He said: "I don't think there were any good grounds for invading Iraq and if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."

The Tory co-chairman added that Blair should be held accountable for his actions and that the public deserved to know the truth about why Britain went to war. He also accused the former Prime Minister of ignoring evidence that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, which led to the start of hostilities.

Blair's attacks on the Tories come amid growing calls for a full investigation into the decision to go to war with Iraq. Many critics argue that the war was based on faulty intelligence and that it has had disastrous consequences for both Iraq and the Middle East region as a whole.

Despite this, the Tory party remains staunchly supportive of the invasion, arguing that it helped to bring democracy to the country and prevent terrorism from spreading throughout the region. However, many people believe that the Tories have been inconsistent in their stance on the war and that they only supported it in order to gain political advantage over Labour.

As the debate continues, the future of Iraq remains uncertain. The country is plagued by ongoing violence and instability, with many people still living without basic services such as electricity and clean water. Some fear that the situation could deteriorate further, leading to even more bloodshed and suffering.

Amidst all this, politicians continue to squabble over whose policies were responsible for creating the chaos in Iraq. But what is clear is that the war has left a deep scar on the nation and raised serious questions about the role of Western powers in shaping global affairs.
