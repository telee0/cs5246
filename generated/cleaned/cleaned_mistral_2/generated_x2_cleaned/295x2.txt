The current leader has already served 2,838 days as PM - more than any other British leader since Winston Churchill during World War II.

However, Mr Blair still faces challenges before achieving this milestone. He must first win another term in office at the polls, which many predict will be a tough task given the public's growing dissatisfaction with his rule. Despite facing criticism on various issues including Iraq, Afghanistan and domestic policy, Mr Blair remains determined to stay in power.

If he does succeed in winning another term, Mr Blair would break the record for the longest continuous tenure of a British prime minister. This achievement would cement his place in history alongside legends such as Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Alec Douglas-Home. However, it would also spark debate among historians about whether his controversial decision to go to war in Iraq was worth the cost.

Regardless of what happens after the election, one thing is clear: Tony Blair will always be remembered as one of Britain's most divisive leaders. While some admire his leadership style and achievements, others view him as a failure whose actions led to devastating consequences for both the country and the world.
