Date: November 4th, 2023

Two prominent political figures have faced significant challenges this week, one being held captive while the other has been removed from their political affiliation. Mrs Hassan, a respected humanitarian leader who had been working with Care International in Iraq since 2017, was kidnapped by unknown assailants on October 19th. The details surrounding her disappearance remain limited as authorities continue to investigate the incident.

On a completely different note, Mr Galloway, former Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow North East, found himself without a political home after the Labor Party expelled him over his vocal opposition to the ongoing conflict in Syria. His stance on the issue, which he expressed publicly during several speeches and interviews, proved to be too contentious within the party leadership, leading to his removal. In response, Galloway stated that he would not seek re-election under any circumstances but vowed to continue advocating for peace through nonviolent means.
