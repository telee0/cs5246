Michael Ferguson, a 36-year-old former soldier turned convicted murderer, made headlines on Friday when he managed to escape from the high-security Carstairs unit in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. His disappearance sparked widespread concern and outrage, particularly given his violent past and the fact that he had only been released temporarily.

Ferguson, who is serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Lisa Marie Colvin, was granted temporary release from prison as part of an ongoing review of his case by the Parole Board for Scotland (PBS). However, it is still unclear how he was able to evade security measures at the facility and make his way to freedom.

The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, quickly issued a statement condemning the circumstances surrounding Ferguson's escape, calling it "totally unacceptable" and demanding answers from the PBS and the Scottish government. She also expressed her sympathy to those affected by the incident, including Colvin's family and friends.

Sturgeon went further, calling on Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf to take responsibility for what she saw as a failure to properly monitor Ferguson during his time outside of prison. She insisted that such incidents could not be ignored or brushed aside, and that they highlighted serious flaws within the criminal justice system.

Yousaf responded to Sturgeon's demands by promising to launch a full review of the situation and work closely with the PBS to identify any gaps in the current procedures for managing prisoners on temporary release. He also reiterated his commitment to ensuring public safety and protecting vulnerable members of society from individuals like Ferguson.

However, critics argue that the SNP and the Scottish government have long been too lenient towards criminals, allowing them back into society without proper safeguards in place. They point to cases like Ferguson's as evidence of this lax approach, which they say puts innocent people at risk.

In recent years, there have been several instances where convicted killers have managed to escape from Scottish prisons, leading to fears that the country's criminal justice system is failing to keep dangerous offenders under control. In addition, there are concerns that the use of electronic tagging devices, which are often used to monitor prisoners on temporary release, may not be enough to prevent escapes and ensure their safe return to custody.

As debate rages over the circumstances surrounding Michael Ferguson's escape and its implications for the wider criminal justice system, many are left wondering whether the SNP and the Scottish government will take the necessary steps to address the underlying issues that allow such incidents to occur in the first place.
