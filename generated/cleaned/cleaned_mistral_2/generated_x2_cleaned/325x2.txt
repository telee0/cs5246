This is due to concerns that the individual candidates may be more aligned with the policies of the party they are currently serving rather than those of UKIP.

One such case involves Damian Hockney, who was once a prominent member of UKIP and rose through the ranks to become its deputy leader. In 2004, he was elected along with fellow party member Peter Hulme-Cross using the list system, which allowed them to run together as part of a larger slate of candidates. However, this victory came at a time when UKIP was still relatively new, and the party had not yet established itself as a major force in British politics.

As UKIP grew in popularity over the years, it became increasingly clear that Hockney's affiliation with the party went beyond his membership card. He has since distanced himself from many of UKIP's core beliefs, particularly its support for Brexit, leading some to question whether he truly represents the views of UKIP voters.

Now, as the party faces a leadership election and looks to rebrand itself in preparation for future battles, questions remain about how closely tied Hockney is to UKIP's ideals. Some within the party argue that because he was elected as part of the UKIP ticket, Hockney should give up his seat and make way for someone who more clearly aligns with the party's values.

Of course, others say that Hockney has every right to continue representing UKIP in parliament, regardless of whether or not he was elected as an individual or as part of a group. Ultimately, only time will tell how much sway these debates carry, but one thing is certain: UKIP remains a powerful force in British politics, and its influence will likely be felt for years to come.
