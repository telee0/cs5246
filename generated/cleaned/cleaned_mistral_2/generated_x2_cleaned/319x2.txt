A cross-party group of MPs and peers has finally unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. The move comes after years of debate on the need for reform, with MPs and peers having failed to agree on any changes since 1999 when 600 hereditary peers lost their seats.
The proposed changes include a reduction in the size of the House of Lords from over 800 members to around 350, with only those who hold public office or have made significant contributions to society being eligible for selection. Additionally, under the new system, members of the upper house would serve six-year terms rather than life tenure, ensuring that there is greater turnover and accountability.
The draft bill also includes measures to increase transparency and democracy within the House of Lords. For example, all appointments would be subject to an independent review process, and members would be required to declare their conflicts of interest publicly. This would help to ensure that the House remains impartial and free from political bias.
Supporters of the proposal argue that it is long overdue and will bring much-needed reform to the UK's parliamentary system. They point out that other countries, such as Canada and Australia, already have similar systems in place, and that the current system is unsustainable and undemocratic.
Opponents of the plan, however, argue that it goes too far and could lead to a power grab by the government. They warn that reducing the size of the upper house and increasing its powers could erode the independence of the legislature and threaten democratic principles.
Despite these concerns, the cross-party group believes that the benefits of reform far outweigh the risks. They argue that a more transparent and accountable House of Lords will better represent the interests of citizens and ensure that politicians are held responsible for their actions.
As the draft bill moves forward, it will face intense scrutiny from both sides of the political divide. But supporters believe that this is the moment for real change, and that a new era of democracy and accountability awaits the UK.
