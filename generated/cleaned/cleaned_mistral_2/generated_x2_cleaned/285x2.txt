The former foreign secretary has been working on charity projects since stepping down from his role as leader of the Conservative Party following its 2001 election defeat. However, he admits that he misses the excitement of being at the heart of government and feels like there is still much work to be done.

In an interview with the Telegraph, Mr Hague said: “I think politics can be very fulfilling but it’s also very boring for long periods of time.” He added: “When you are in power, you get all the attention and you have a real impact. But when you step back, it becomes much more difficult to make a difference and it’s often quite tedious work.”

Despite feeling like he may never want to go back into politics, Mr Hague does not completely rule out the possibility. He says: “It’s always tempting to consider going back into politics because I believe we have so many challenges ahead of us both here and abroad.”

However, he believes that he needs to take a break before making any decisions about the future. He said: “At this stage, my focus is on my charities and family. I will continue to support the Conservatives but I am enjoying having the freedom to do things that aren’t necessarily related to politics.”

Mr Hague’s comments come after he announced that he was stepping away from one of his key roles as chairman of the British Red Cross, which he had held since 2006. In a statement issued earlier this week, he said that he felt it was time to move on and allow someone else to lead the charity.

The former foreign minister’s decision to give up his role as chairman of the charity has sparked speculation that he may be preparing to launch a new political career. However, Mr Hague has denied any plans to run for public office, saying that he is simply taking a step back from his duties to concentrate on other areas of his life.
