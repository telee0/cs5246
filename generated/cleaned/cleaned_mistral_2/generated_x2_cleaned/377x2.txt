The proposals include measures to ensure that these casinos are regulated and controlled by local authorities.

In response to concerns over the potential negative impact of super-casinos on society, Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell has stated that the casinos being considered will not follow the same model as those seen in the United States. In particular, there will be no release of pheromones from machines designed to encourage aggressive gambling or removal of clocks from walls, which is common practice in American casinos. Instead, it's expected that these casinos will focus on providing entertainment and relaxation to customers rather than solely promoting gambling.

The announcement comes after months of debate surrounding the issue of gambling reform in the UK. Supporters of the proposal argue that introducing more casino gambling could boost the economy while opponents warn of the negative consequences such as increased crime rates and social problems associated with gambling addiction.

While the details of how these casinos would operate remain unclear at this time, it seems likely that they would be subject to strict regulations to prevent any harm coming to individuals or society as a whole. However, given the controversial nature of gambling and its potential impacts on people, it remains to be seen whether these plans will gain enough support to become a reality.
