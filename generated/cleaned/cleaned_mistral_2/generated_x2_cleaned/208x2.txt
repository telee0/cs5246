The Indian government has announced its intention to deploy troops to the region in order to protect its citizens living there, citing concerns over rising terrorism and separatist movements.

However, the decision to send troops to the area has been met with criticism by human rights groups and local leaders who fear that it could lead to further conflict and violence. There are also fears that the deployment could be seen as an attempt to exert greater control over the region, which is currently under the jurisdiction of Indonesia.

Indonesia's foreign minister Retno Marsudi has called on India to reconsider its plans, stating that any such action must be done through diplomatic channels and not through the use of force. She also warned that any military intervention could harm bilateral relations between the two countries.

Despite these calls, however, the Indian government remains committed to protecting its interests in the region. It has already sent troops to several other areas near the border with Indonesia in recent years, including in the North Sumatra province.

The deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province.

It is worth noting that while tensions between India and Indonesia may seem high at the moment, they have historically maintained strong ties and cooperation. Both countries share economic and cultural links, making efforts to resolve their differences all the more important for regional stability.
