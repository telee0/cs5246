The move comes after a long campaign by unions representing millions of workers, who have been pushing for reforms that would give them greater flexibility and control over their financial futures.

One of the main concerns raised by the unions is the proposed increase in the mandatory retirement age for public sector workers. Under current laws, public servants are required to leave their jobs at the age of 60, but this could soon change under new plans being considered by the government. Unions argue that such a change would be unfair to many employees, particularly those who may not be physically or mentally able to continue working beyond the current age limit.

In response to the news, several unions representing more than 4.5 million workers have threatened to take joint action if the plans go ahead. This includes organizing strikes, protests, and other forms of industrial action, which could cause disruptions across the country. Unison, one of the largest unions involved, said it was prepared to do whatever it takes to protect its members' rights and interests.

"This is an outrageous attempt to impose on our members a pension system that will force them to work longer and earn less," said Unison general secretary Len McCluskey. "We will fight tooth and nail against these proposals and we won't stop until they are defeated."

Other unions have also expressed their opposition to the proposed changes. For example, GMB, another large trade union, said it had received numerous reports from members who were concerned about the potential impact of the changes on their pensions and job security.

"These plans could lead to thousands of workers losing their jobs and facing financial hardship," said GMB national secretary Jason Donovan. "We cannot let that happen. We must stand together and demand better for our members."

Despite the strong opposition from unions, the government remains committed to reforming the pension system. In recent years, there have been calls to raise the state pension age and introduce a new type of retirement savings account called individual accounts (ISAs). Supporters of ISAs argue that they would give individuals more control over their own retirement savings, while critics warn that they could lead to lower pensions and higher levels of poverty among older people.

However, the Cabinet Office has yet to reveal any details about the specific measures it intends to implement as part of its review. It is likely that further announcements will be made in due course, which could spark even more controversy and debate.

In summary, the announcement of a major review of the UK's pension system has led to threats of industrial action
