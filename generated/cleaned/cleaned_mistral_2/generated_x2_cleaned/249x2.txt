In a surprising turn of events, Prime Minister Tony Blair has once again refused to engage in a debate with his political opponents during the upcoming general election. The decision comes as a disappointment to many who were hoping to see a face-off between the incumbent prime minister and his rivals, particularly after Tory leader Michael Howard called on him to do so earlier in the month.

At his monthly press conference, Blair reiterated his stance against debates, citing the same reasons that he has been giving since the beginning of his tenure as PM. "We answer this question every single election campaign," he said, "and, for the reasons that I have given before, the answer remains the same - no." Critics argue that such a refusal will only further undermine Blair's legitimacy, while proponents say that it is simply an effective strategy for avoiding potentially damaging questions from his adversaries.
