His appointment is seen as a move by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to shore up support among members of Parliament and appease critics on the right-wing of the Conservative Party.

Known for his fiery rhetoric and uncompromising stance against corruption, Kinnock has long been viewed as an effective leader and strategist. He rose to prominence during the 1970s, when he served as Secretary General of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the largest trade union in the UK at that time. In this role, he helped organize several major strikes, including the infamous miners’ strike of 1984.

In 1983, Kinnock became the first Welshman to lead the Labour Party. Under his leadership, the party saw significant successes, winning several general elections and increasing its representation in both houses of parliament. However, his tenure as leader also marked a period of internal conflict within the party over issues such as nuclear weapons and membership in the European Community.

After leaving office as party leader in 1992, Kinnock went on to serve as an EU Commissioner for several years before being appointed to the House of Lords in 2016. As a peer, he has continued to advocate for progressive policies and social justice causes, while also serving as a key voice in debates surrounding Brexit.

Despite his long history in British politics, Kinnock remains relatively unknown outside of political circles. He is widely regarded as a pragmatic and strategic thinker, but some have criticized him for being too willing to compromise or make deals with politicians on the other side of the aisle. Nonetheless, his appointment as leader of the opposition marks a significant shift in the political landscape, and many are eagerly watching to see how he navigates these challenges moving forward.
