The loss of Sir Geoffrey is deeply felt across the political spectrum. Many politicians remember him as an influential figure in their early careers.

His passing paved the way for another significant moment in British politics. The failed “stalking horse” leadership challenge by David Davis made it easier for Michael Heseltine to launch his own bid for party leadership. It’s unclear what impact this will have on the future direction of the Conservative Party, but one thing is certain – there will be no shortage of drama in Westminster in the coming weeks.

In addition to his work in parliament, Sir Geoffrey was known for his philanthropic efforts. He established the Dickens Fellowship, which provides support and resources to young people in care. His legacy will live on through these initiatives, which continue to make a positive difference in the lives of thousands of young people each year.
