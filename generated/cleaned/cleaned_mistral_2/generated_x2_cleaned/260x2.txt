A bitter feud between Labour party leaders has raised concerns over whether it can win a third term at next month's general election. The row erupted after former prime minister Tony Blair announced he would not stand for re-election and accused his successor Gordon Brown of failing to tackle key issues such as immigration.

The tension reached boiling point last night when Mr Brown faced criticism from his own cabinet members during a private meeting with MPs. Sources revealed that several normally loyal backbenchers warned the Prime Minister that continuing to feud with his predecessor could damage Labour's chances of victory in May.

In response, Mr Brown called an emergency press conference today to try and defuse the situation. He claimed that he had no intention of attacking Mr Blair but insisted that they needed to focus on the future rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

"I have always made clear my respect for Tony," said Mr Brown, who took office as PM after the resignation of Mr Blair two years ago. "But we cannot afford to spend our time looking backwards or getting bogged down in what happened in the past. Our job is to move forward and build a better Britain for all."

His comments were echoed by Shadow Chancellor Alistair Darling, who also distanced himself from the spat between the two men. "We need to focus on delivering for working families and making sure people have access to good jobs, healthcare, and education," he said.

Despite attempts to downplay the row, however, tensions remain high within the party. It is understood that Mr Brown will face further criticism from colleagues later this week when they gather for another crucial meeting ahead of the polls.

Meanwhile, opposition parties are eager to exploit the divisions among Labour ranks. Conservative Party leader David Cameron accused Mr Brown of being weak and indecisive, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed that the government's handling of key issues such as the economy and immigration had been disastrous under Mr Brown's leadership.

"It is becoming increasingly obvious that the current government is unable or unwilling to tackle these problems head-on," Mr Clegg said. "If Labour wants any hope of winning the next election, they must get their act together quickly."

As the campaign enters its final weeks, Mr Brown knows that he must unite his party behind him if he is to secure a third term for Labour. However, with dissenting voices growing louder both inside and outside parliament, the path to victory remains fraught with danger.

One source close to the talks revealed that senior Labour figures privately concede that the rift between Mr Brown and Mr Blair could be fatal for the party. They believe that unless the pair can set aside their differences and present a united front, they risk losing support among voters who want stability and strong leadership.

"There are real fears within the party that if this feud continues, it could spell disaster for us come May," one source told The Independent. "We need everyone pulling in the same direction if we are going to win."
