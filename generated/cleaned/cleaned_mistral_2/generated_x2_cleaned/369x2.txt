In an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said he believed that increasing airport capacity was vital for Britain’s economic growth and that there were no viable alternatives to expanding Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. “I think it is absolutely essential,” he said. “We need more flights coming into this country.”

However, the comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents’ groups and local councils to the government’s White Paper, which sets out its plans for the future of aviation in the UK. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. Opposers argue that the proposals are too expensive, environmentally damaging and could have negative impacts on local communities. They also claim that the government should be focusing on promoting alternative modes of transport such as trains and buses instead.

Mr Johnson dismissed these concerns, saying that the benefits of increased airport capacity far outweighed any negatives. “There will always be noise and disruption when you build anything like an airport but we are investing billions of pounds in making sure that it happens in a way that minimises those problems,” he said. He added that the proposed expansions would create thousands of new jobs and boost tourism, helping to drive economic growth across the UK.

Despite opposition from some groups, polling suggests that most people support airport expansion in principle. A survey conducted earlier this year found that 67% of the public thought it was important to increase airport capacity, while only 21% opposed the idea. However, there are still many who express concern about the environmental impact of flying and the potential for planes to disrupt their lives. Some residents living near the three airports due for expansion have already expressed frustration over noise levels and flight delays, and there are fears that these issues could become even worse if the number of passengers increases significantly.

As tensions rise between supporters and opponents of airport expansion, it remains to be seen whether the court challenge will succeed in blocking or delaying the government’s plans. If it does not, it could set a precedent for other infrastructure projects facing similar challenges, potentially paving the way for major developments in fields such as renewable energy and transportation. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear: the debate over how best to grow our cities and economy is likely to continue well into the future.
