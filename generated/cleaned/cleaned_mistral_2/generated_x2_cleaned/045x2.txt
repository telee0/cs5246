Among those implicated is Edinburgh MSP John Finnie, who earns up to £4,000 per month from his role as a consultant for the renewable energy company Green Energy UK.

2) The issue of transparency in politics has been raised once again after it was revealed that many MPs have undeclared earnings from outside sources. It emerged that the Edinburgh MSP earned up to £30,000 a year from the law firm Tods Murray, where he is a partner. This raises concerns about conflicts of interest and potential breaches of ethical standards in parliament.

3) In response to these allegations, the Scottish Government announced plans to introduce new regulations on MSPs' external activities. Under the proposed rules, any income over £25,000 must be declared publicly, and any activities deemed to pose a conflict of interest with parliamentary duties will need to undergo further scrutiny. However, critics argue that this may not go far enough in addressing the issue of financial ties between MPs and other sectors.

4) Meanwhile, the Edinburgh MSP has denied any wrongdoing and said he has taken advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare. He also argued that his role at Tods Murray does not pose a conflict of interest with his work in the Scottish Parliament. Despite this, there remain questions about how transparent MSPs should be about their outside interests and whether they are able to effectively balance their political duties with commercial commitments.

5) As the debate continues, it becomes clear that transparency in politics remains a major concern for many people. There is growing pressure for more stringent regulations on MPs' external activities, as well as greater accountability and oversight from government bodies. Ultimately, only by ensuring full transparency can we hope to restore trust in our elected representatives and maintain faith in the democratic process.
