The comments came during a private meeting with Labour members and are believed to have been made in an effort to boost the party’s support among ethnic minority communities.

Clarke’s remarks have sparked outrage from many Labour MPs who fear that increasing immigration will harm the party’s popularity with traditional working-class voters. “We need to make sure we don’t let down our core supporters,” one MP told The Guardian. “People are worried about their jobs and they feel like their country is under threat from people coming here.”

Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has also condemned Clarke’s comments, arguing that they contradict Prime Minister Tony Blair’s promise of a net cut in immigration. “It is clear that Mr. Clarke is out of step with the government’s official policy on immigration,” Fox said in a statement. “If this is what he truly believes then it should be spelled out clearly so that voters know where the government stands on this issue.”

Blair himself has been accused of breaking his promises on immigration by allowing too many people into the country without proper checks or restrictions. Critics argue that this has led to increased crime rates and a strain on public services such as healthcare and education.

The controversy over immigration has become increasingly divisive in recent years, with different groups taking opposite positions on the issue. Some politicians argue that immigration is necessary for economic growth and that it brings new ideas and perspectives to Britain. Others claim that it leads to social problems and puts pressure on local resources.

As the debate continues, the government has struggled to find a way forward on the issue. It was reported earlier this year that the Home Office had abandoned plans for a new points system designed to control immigration based on skills and qualifications, citing concerns from businesses that it would damage recruitment efforts. This has prompted critics to call for a comprehensive review of current immigration policies and procedures.

In the meantime, Clarke has been forced to defend his position publicly. In an interview with Sky News, he argued that the comments attributed to him were taken out of context and that he did not want to encourage uncontrolled migration. He also denied any intention of undermining Blair’s leadership or damaging the Labour Party’s chances at future elections.

“I am very concerned about the impact of immigration on our economy and society,” Clarke said. “But I also think that there is a moral responsibility on us to help refugees and provide them with a safe haven in our country. We cannot turn our backs on people who are fleeing persecution and war.”

Despite these arguments, however, Clarke’s comments have caused significant political fallout, with many MPs calling for greater clarity on the government’s stance on immigration. As tensions continue to simmer beneath the surface, it remains to be seen how long the government can keep its fragile coalition together on this contentious issue.
