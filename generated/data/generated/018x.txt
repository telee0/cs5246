On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Prince Charles paid a visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland, accompanied by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dominic Raab. During his speech at the memorial service, he condemned the genocidal regime that once operated there and honored the millions of people who were murdered during World War II. The Prince's comments came as part of a broader initiative by the UK government to promote awareness of the Holocaust and prevent future instances of genocide. In recent years, Prince Harry has also been an active advocate for Holocaust education and remembrance, often speaking out against those who deny the historic significance of the event.</s>
