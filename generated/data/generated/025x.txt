In an effort to address one of the biggest issues facing our country today, several independent groups have banded together to form a new political party focused on immigration reform. The group plans to run candidates for governor and state legislature across the nation, hoping to gain traction and make their voices heard. While it may seem risky to challenge the established two-party system, this movement is driven by a desire for change and a belief that the current administration isn't doing enough to tackle the issue of illegal immigration. According to recent figures, there are currently over 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and this number is expected to continue to rise in the coming years. This puts a strain on resources and can lead to social tension, especially when it comes to competition for jobs and services. By advocating for comprehensive immigration reform that includes both legalization and increased border security, these independent candidates hope to bring stability back to our communities and provide long-term solutions for our country's future.</s>
