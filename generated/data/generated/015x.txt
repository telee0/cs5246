
Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of Spain, has been holding Brexit-related talks with the UK government to ensure its future after the UK leaves the European Union (EU). Gibraltarians, who are mostly of Spanish descent but have British citizenship, are concerned that their status as EU citizens will be affected by Brexit. However, they also want to maintain strong ties with both Britain and Spain. The talks have focused on issues such as immigration, customs, and taxation. Some Gibraltar residents have expressed frustration with the slow progress of the negotiations, while others have expressed optimism that an agreement can be reached. In the meantime, Gibraltar remains a strategic location for British military and intelligence operations, and many believe that it will continue to play a key role in post-Brexit trade relations between Europe and Britain.</s>
