The measure is aimed at protecting the health of young people and preventing them from becoming addicted to nicotine products. Mr McConnell, who led the campaign for a ban on smoking in public places in Scotland, welcomed the move. "This decision will help prevent a whole new generation from being hooked on harmful chemicals," he said. However, opponents argue that it could lead to increased illegal activity and that smokers should be allowed to make their own choices. The debate continues as politicians weigh the potential benefits and risks of such measures.</s>
