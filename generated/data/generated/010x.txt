
Scotland is set to gain greater autonomy from Westminster under new plans, according to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The move would see Glasgow and other cities given more power over their own affairs, while Scotland's executive would be allowed to take a leading role in shaping policy decisions that affect the country as a whole. This development marks a significant shift in the balance of power between Scotland and England and could pave the way for further devolution. However, critics argue that such changes could lead to greater divisions within Scotland itself and with other parts of the UK.</s>
