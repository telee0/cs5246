
A major diplomatic deal has been reached between the world's largest economies to address their combined debt burden of over $20 trillion. The agreement, which was brokered by Mr. Brown, will see countries pledge to cut their deficits by a minimum of 0.5% each year, with some nations agreeing to even more ambitious targets. Finance ministers from across the globe hailed the deal as a historic step towards resolving the global financial crisis. In addition to reducing their own debts, countries have agreed to work together to support struggling economies such as Greece and Italy. Despite initial skepticism from critics, the proposal quickly gained momentum after being endorsed by the G8 leaders earlier this month.</s>
