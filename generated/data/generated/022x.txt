London, England – During a speech today at the annual Labour Party conference, former Prime Minister Tony Blair criticized current Prime Minister John Howard for failing to cut asylum processing time in half, despite his promise to do so if he won re-election.

“Mr Howard has failed to deliver on one of his key promises,” Blair said, adding that “Labour would have cut asylum processing times in half if we were elected.”

Howard responded by saying that while it’s true that there are delays in the system, but this is due to increased security checks and not because of any lack of resources or willpower.

The issue of asylum processing times has been a contentious topic during the election campaign, with both parties making promises to speed up the process and ensure that genuine refugees receive protection while preventing bogus claims from being processed.

Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have also pledged to reform the asylum system and introduce a new points-based immigration system. They claim that such a system would encourage legitimate immigrants who can contribute positively to society while deterring those who seek to abuse the system.

As the election nears, the political debate over asylum continues to intensify, with each party vying for votes by promising to tackle the issue head-on. While it remains to be seen which party will ultimately succeed in implementing their plans, one thing is clear: the asylum crisis is not going away anytime soon.</s>
