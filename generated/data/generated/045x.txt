According to reports, Mr McLeTchie is facing growing calls for him to resign from his position after he was accused of engaging in unethical behavior during an election campaign.

In addition to this, there have been conflicts within the party regarding its direction and leadership style. Several members have expressed their disinterest in working with Mr McLeTchie, citing concerns over his lack of transparency and accountability. As such, it remains to be seen whether or not the party can hold together and continue to function effectively without him at the helm.

Despite these challenges, however, one source close to the matter stated that "Mr McLeTchie remains committed to leading his party forward and ensuring its continued success." This comment prompted further speculation as to what his plans might involve, particularly given the ongoing tensions within the party and the broader political landscape.

As the situation unfolds, many observers remain intrigued by what will happen next. Will Mr McLeTchie be able to weather this storm and maintain his position as leader? Or will he ultimately be forced out, either through internal pressure or external forces beyond his control? Only time will tell, but it seems clear that this story continues to capture the attention of politically minded individuals across the country.</s>
