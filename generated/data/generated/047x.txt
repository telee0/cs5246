This move follows concerns raised by opposition MPs that current fee levels are making it difficult for some young people to afford higher education, particularly those from lower income families. Wallace, the Education Secretary, said: "We need to ensure that all students have access to quality higher education, regardless of their background." It is hoped that this initiative will encourage more young people from both countries to apply to Scottish universities.
2) The Scottish National Party (SNP) has announced plans to provide additional funding for Scottish universities to reduce the cost of tuition fees for international students. According to Wallace, who made the announcement at an event promoting higher education, this measure will help attract top talent from around the world and boost the country's economy. He added: "We want Scotland to be known as a welcoming destination for the brightest minds in science, technology, engineering and mathematics." Under the new scheme, students from non-EU countries studying in Scotland will receive £4,000 per year instead of the current £9,250.
3) There were calls today for the UK government to consider free university tuition for all students, following the success of similar schemes in Scotland and other parts of Europe.

He went on to argue that universities should focus on teaching skills rather than just qualifications, in order to better prepare graduates for the jobs market.

Some MSPs predicted that a reduction in fees would lead to increased applications from English and Welsh students, while others warned that this might lead to reduced revenue for universities and potentially lower standards of education. Wallace acknowledged the challenges ahead but reiterated his commitment to making higher education accessible and affordable for all.
5) There was a significant fall in the number of applicants from England and Wales to Scottish universities last year, according to figures released today. Official data shows that there was a drop of 16% compared to the previous year, with many citing high tuition fees as a key factor. Wallace expressed disappointment at this trend, stating: "It's important that we maintain our reputation as one of the most attractive destinations for higher education in the UK." To address this issue, the Scottish government has launched a series of initiatives aimed</s>
