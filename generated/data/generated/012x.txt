Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has apologized for the Iraq War, acknowledging that his actions led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and military personnel. He made the statement during a court appearance related to an investigation into his role in the war. As he was being grilled by lawyers representing victims, Mr. Blair broke down in tears and offered a heartfelt apology to those who suffered as a result of his decision-making. Despite this, it is unclear whether his apology will be enough to prevent him from facing legal prosecution in the UK over alleged war crimes committed during the conflict.</s>
