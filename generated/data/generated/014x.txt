A clause in a bill due for debate on Monday will allow Mr Blair to resign his position if he chooses, effectively ending his time as leader of the Labour Party. The move is being seen as a way for the party to move forward, following its poor performance in last year's general election. Under new rules, MPs will have more say over who becomes leader, with a series of votes taking place in the House of Commons over the coming months. If no candidate receives a majority, a vote will take place among the members of Parliament themselves.

The decision to introduce this clause was made at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) earlier this week, which took place after the Sun newspaper revealed details of the proposed change in law. According to reports, Mr Blair had expressed his intention to retire during a private conversation with a senior member of the PLP, but had later denied any such plans when asked by journalists. However, the paper insisted that it had obtained evidence that the former Prime Minister had agreed to step down at some point soon. Mr Blair has since been quoted as saying: "I am very clear that I do not intend to stand again as Prime Minister."

The introduction of the clause is likely to lead to further speculation about the future of the Conservative Party. Many Tory MPs are thought to be unhappy with their current leadership, which has been criticised for its lack of direction and slow pace of reform. Some are also believed to be considering defecting to another political party, although no official announcement has yet been made. There is also talk of a potential merger between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, which could help both parties to recover from their recent setbacks at the polls.

In other political developments, there were calls for the government to address concerns over climate change after a group of scientists warned that global temperatures could rise by up to 10 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. According to a report published in the journal Nature Climate Change, these extreme levels of warming could cause widespread droughts, floods and food shortages. Experts have urged policymakers to take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change.

Finally, there were calls for a review of the legal system after a man was released without charge under anti-terrorism laws following an incident outside London City Airport. It is understood that the man, who is aged in his thirties, was arrested after police found suspicious packages near the airport. He was then held in custody for several hours before being released without charge. Critics have argued that such arrests can damage the reputation of innocent people and undermine public trust in the justice system. They have called for greater transparency and accountability in the use of anti-terrorism measures.</s>
