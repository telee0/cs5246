They also call for greater cooperation between governments to ensure that refugees are able to access safe accommodation and essential services once they arrive in the UK.

In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of the UK's handling of asylum seekers, particularly with regards to their treatment in detention centres. However, both Mr Howard and Mr Michael say they believe it is important to maintain strong borders while ensuring that genuine refugees are treated humanely and with dignity.

"We must have a balanced approach," says Mr Howard, "one that allows us to protect our country from those who seek to abuse our generosity, while still providing aid to those in need."

Mr Michael adds: "It is important that we continue to be compassionate towards legitimate refugees, but also take steps to prevent further illegal immigration into our country."

The Conservative Party has faced criticism in the past for its policies on immigration and asylum. Some argue that the party has taken too hardline an approach, leading to long wait times for asylum claims and harsh conditions in detention centres. Others argue that the party should do more to address the root causes of migration and help create stable environments where refugees can live safely.

Despite these criticisms, Mr Howard and Mr Tory remain committed to maintaining a secure border while also supporting refugees. As Prime Minister, Mr Tory says he will work to find solutions to the current crisis that balance the needs of those seeking safety with the concerns of British citizens.

"Our top priority is protecting our country and keeping our citizens safe," he says. "But at the same time, we cannot turn our backs on those in need. We must find a way forward that is fair to everyone involved."

Many people are calling for change in the UK's immigration policy. Some argue that it is too difficult for legitimate refugees to get the help they need, while others argue that the system favours economic migrants over genuine asylum seekers. The government has yet to make any major changes to its immigration or asylum policies, which many say are outdated and no longer fit the real world.

However, Mr Howard and Mr Tory say they are willing to listen to feedback from the public and work with experts in the field to improve the system. In particular, they say they want to see better coordination between different departments and agencies responsible for immigration and asylum.

"We know that there are areas where our policies could be improved," says Mr Howard. "And we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that refugees receive the support they need."

As the debate rages on, it remains to be seen what specific actions the Conservatives will take to address the refugee crisis. But one thing is clear – the issue will continue to dominate political discourse for the foreseeable future.</s>
