The new party leader is expected to set out a radical new policy platform that will challenge the current Conservative government, including a focus on key issues such as climate change, poverty, and unemployment. In an interview, Miliband said he was committed to making sure that "the next election is not won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything for short term political gain". He also promised to be more proactive in seeking out solutions to complex policy problems and to work closely with other political parties to ensure that everyone has a voice. As part of this approach, Miliband has announced plans to establish a unit within his office to help coordinate cross-party efforts on major policy challenges. This move reflects a growing recognition among politicians that many important issues cannot be resolved through traditional political means alone.</s>
