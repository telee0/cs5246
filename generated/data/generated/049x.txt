The Secretary of State for Home Affairs has stated that his goal is to create a more streamlined process for legal immigration while also tightening restrictions on illegal immigration. Mr Clarke has acknowledged the need to address the backlog at the Immigration Enforcement Agency and improve communication between different departments within the Home Office. He has also expressed his determination to work closely with other government agencies to prevent illegal immigration and ensure that all individuals entering the country have legitimate reasons for doing so.</s>
