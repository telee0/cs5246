According to a report published by The Guardian newspaper on Sunday, Mr. Brown claimed that Mr. Blair had lied to him about Iraq war, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people.
Mr. Brown's statement came after months of speculation that he would release documents detailing Mr. Blair's role in the war. He is reportedly planning to publish more information on the issue later this year.
The allegations made against Mr. Blair have caused widespread outrage among members of the public who are calling for him to be held accountable for his actions. They believe that the invasion was unjustified and that it resulted in unnecessary suffering.
Meanwhile, the Conservative Party has also been facing criticism over their handling of the economy during the pandemic. Some critics argue that the Tories should have done more to protect vulnerable communities from the virus's impact.
However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who leads the Conservatives, has defended his government's response to the crisis. In an interview with Fox News yesterday, he told viewers that his team worked tirelessly to save lives and support businesses affected by the pandemic.
The upcoming general election, scheduled for December, is expected to be one of the most closely watched events of the year. While both Labour and the Tories are struggling to gain support, there are rumors that other parties could form alliances or join forces to create a new ruling coalition.
As the campaign season ramps up, candidates are expected to make promises and pledges to win voters' trust. However, given the current political climate, many believe that it will be difficult for any single party to secure a clear victory.</s>
