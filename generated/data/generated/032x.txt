The demonstrators, who were dressed as hunters, carried weapons and chanted slogans that targeted specific politicians. The ban was imposed following an incident involving the politician earlier this year, which resulted in charges being brought against him for assault. The Labour Party has since distanced itself from the demonstration and called on its supporters to refrain from engaging in such behaviour. However, many protesters defended their actions, stating that they had the right to express themselves peacefully within the limits of the law. They also claimed that they were simply trying to draw attention to issues surrounding animal rights and hunting practices. The court is expected to rule on whether the demonstration was lawful or not in coming weeks. Meanwhile, the controversy continues to divide political opinion, with some seeing it as an attempt to silence free speech, while others view it as necessary to protect public safety.</s>
